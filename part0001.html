      <p> he complained of doing at fixed times in the monastery. But the demon does not allow him to keep the regular prayers or norms of fasting or orders of vigil. Having bound him fast in the madness of avarice, he persuades him to devote all his effort to his handicraft.</p>
      <p> There are three forms of this sickness, all of which are equally condemned by the Holy Scriptures and the teaching of the Fathers. The first induces those who were poor to acquire and save the goods they lacked in the world. The second compels those who have renounced worldly goods by offering them to God, to have regrets and to seek after them again. A third infects a monk from the start with lack of faith and ardor, so preventing his complete detachment from worldly things, producing in him a fear of poverty and distrust in God's providence and leading him to break the promises he made when he renounced the world.</p>
      <p> Examples of these three forms of avarice are, as I have said, condemned in Holy Scripture. Gehazi wanted to acquire property which he did not previously possess, and therefore never received the prophetic grace which his teacher had wished to leave him in the place of an inheritance. Because of the prophet's curse he inherited incurable leprosy instead of a blessing (cf. 2 Kgs. 5:27). And Judas, who wished to acquire money which he had previously abandoned on following Christ, not only lapsed so far as to betray the Master and lose his place in the circle of the apostles; he also put an end to his life in the flesh through a violent death (cf. Matt. 27:5). Thirdly, Ananias and Sapphira were condemned to death by the Apostle's word when they kept back something of what they had acquired (cf. Acts 5:1-10). Again, in Deuteronomy Moses is indirectly exhorting those who promise to renounce the world, and who then retain their earthly possessions because of the fear that comes from lack of faith, when he says: 'What</p>
      <p> man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted? He shall not go out to do battle; let him return to his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart' (of. Deut. 20:8). Could anything be clearer or more certain than this testimony? Should not we who have left the world learn from these examples to renounce it completely and in this state go forth to do battle? We should not turn others from the perfection taught in the Gospels and make them cowardly because of our own hesitant and feeble start.</p>
      <p> Some, impelled by their own deceit and avarice, distort the [VI] 81</p>
      <p> St John Cassian On the Eight Vices</p>
      <p> On Avarice</p>
      <p> meaning of the scriptural statement, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive' (Acts 20:35). They do the same with the Lord's words when He says, 'If you want to be perfect, go and sell all you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come and follow Me' (Matt. 19:21). They judge that it is more blessed to have control over one's personal wealth, and to give from this to those in need, than to possess nothing at all. They should know, however, that they have not yet renounced the world or achieved monastic perfection so long as they are ashamed to accept for Christ's sake the poverty of the Apostle and to provide for themselves and the needy through the labor of their hands (cf Acts 20:34); for only in this way will they fulfill the .monastic profession and be glorified with the Apostle. Having distributed their former wealth, let them fight the good fight with Paul 'in hunger and thirst ... in cold and nakedness' (2 Cor. 11:27). Had the Apostle thought that the possession of one's former wealth was more necessary for perfection, he would not have despised his official status as a Roman citizen (cf. Acts 22:25). Nor would those in Jerusalem have sold their houses and fields and given the money they got from them to the apostles (cf. Acts 4: 34-35), had they felt that the apostles considered it more blessed to live off one's own possessions than from one's labor and the offerings of the Gentiles.</p>
      <p> The Apostle gives us a clear lesson in this matter when he writes to the Romans in the passage beginning, 'But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints', and ending: 'They were pleased to do it, and indeed they are in debt to them' (Rom. 15:25-27). He himself was often in chains, in prison or on fatiguing travel, and so was usually prevented from providing for himself with his own hands. He tells us that he accepted the necessities of life from the brethren who came to him from Macedonia (cf. 2 Cor. 11:9); and writing to the Philippians he says: 'Now you Philippians know also that . . . when I deparfed from Macedonia no church except you helped me with gifts of money. For even in Thessalonica you sent me help, not once but twice' (Phil. 4:15-16). Are, then, the avaricious right and are these men more blessed than the Apostle himself, because they satisfied his wants from their own resources? Surely no one would be so foolish as to say this.</p>
      <p> If we want to follow the gospel commandment and the practice of the whole Church as it was founded initially upon the apostles.</p>
      <p> [VI] 82</p>
      <p> St John Cassian On the Eight Vices</p>
      <p> On Avarice</p>
      <p> we should not follow our own notions or give wrong meanings to things rightly said. We must discard faint-hearted, faithless opinion and recover the strictness of the Gospel; In this way we shall be able to follow also in the footsteps of the Fathers, adhering to the discipline of the cenobitic life and truly renouncing this world.</p>
      <p> It is good here to recall the words of St Basil, Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia. He is reported once to have said to a senator, who had renounced the world in a half-hearted manner and was keeping back some of his personal fortune: 'You have lost the senator and failed to make a monk.' We should therefore make every effort to cut out from our souls this root of all evils, avarice, in the certain knowledge that if the root remains the branches will sprout freely.</p>
      <p> This uprooting is difficult to achieve unless we are living in a monastery, for in a monastery we cease to worry about even our most basic needs. With the fate of Ananias and Sapphira in mind, we should shudder at the thought of keeping to ourselves anything of our former possessions. Similarly, frightened by the example of Gehazi who was afflicted with incurable leprosy because of his avarice, let us guard against piling up money which we did not have while in the world. Finally, recalling Judas' death by hanging, let us beware of acquiring again any of the things which we have already renounced. In all this we should remember how uncertain is the hour of our death, so that our Lord does not come unexpectedly and, finding our conscience soiled with avarice, say to us what God says to the rich man in the Gospel: 'You fool, this night your soul will be required of you: who then will be the owner of what you have stored up?' (Luke 12: 20).</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Eight Vices On Anger</p>
      <p> Our fourth struggle is against the demon of anger. We must, with God's help, eradicate his deadly poison from the depths of our souls. So long as he dwells in our hearts and blinds the eyes of the heart with his somber disorders, we can neither discriminate what is for our good, nor achieve spiritual knowledge, nor fulfill our good intentions, nor participate in true life: and our intellect will remain impervious to the contemplation of the true, divine light; for it is written, 'For my eye is troubled because of anger' (Ps. 6:7. LXX).</p>
      <p> [VI] 83</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Eight Vices On Anger</p>
      <p> Nor will we share in divine wisdom even though We are deemed wise by all men, for it is written: 'Anger lodges in the bosom of fools' (Eccles. 7:9). Nor can we discriminate in decisions affecting our salvation even though we are thought by our fellow men to have good sense, for it is written: 'Anger destroys even men of good sense' (Prov. 15:1. LXX). Nor will we be able to keep our lives in righteousness with a watchful heart, for it is written; 'Man's anger does not bring about the righteousness of God' (]as. i: 20). Nor will we be able to acquire the decorum and dignity praised by all, for it is written: 'An angry man is not dignified' (Prov. 11: 25. LXX).</p>
      <p> If, therefore, you desire to attain perfection and rightly to pursue the spiritual way, you should make yourself a stranger to all sinful anger and wrath. Listen to what St Paul enjoins: 'Rid yourselves of all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, evil speaking and all malice' (Eph. 4:31). In saying 'all' he leaves no excuse for regarding any anger as necessary or reasonable. If you want to correct your brother when he is doing wrong or to punish him, you must try to keep yourself calm; otherwise you yourself may catch the sickness you are seeking to cure and you may find that the words of the Gospel now apply to you: 'Physician, heal yourself (Luke 4:23), or 'Why do you look at the speck of dust in your brother's eye, and not notice the rafter in your own eye?' (Matt. 7:3).</p>
      <p> No matter what provokes it, anger blinds the soul's eyes, preventing it from seeing the Sun of righteousness. Leaves, whether of gold or lead, placed over the eyes, obstruct the sight equally, for the value of the gold does not affect the blindness it produces. Similarly, anger, whether reasonable or unreasonable, obstructs our spiritual vision. Our mcensive power can be Used in a way that is according to nature only when turned against our own impassioned or self-indulgent thoughts. This is what the Prophet teaches us when he says: 'Be angry, and do not sin' (Ps. 4:4. LXX) - that is, be angry with your own passions and with your malicious thoughts, and do not sin by carrying out their suggestions. What follows clearly confirms this interpretation: 'As you lie in bed, repent of what you say in your heart' (Ps. 4:4. LXX) - that is, when malicious thoughts enter your heart, expel them with anger, and then turn to compunction and repentance as if your soul were resting in a bed of stillness.</p>
      <p> St Paul agrees with this when he cites this passage and then adds:</p>
      <p> [VI] 84</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Eight Vices On Anger</p>
      <p> 'Do not let the sun go down upon your anger: and do not make room for the devil' (Eph. 4: 26-27), by which he means: 'Do not make Christ, the Sun of righteousness, set in your hearts by angering him through your assent to evil thoughts, thereby allowing the devil to find room in you because of Christ's departure.' God has spoken of this Sun in the words of His prophet: 'But upon you that fear My name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in His wings' (Mai. 4:2). If we take Paul's saying literally, it does not permit us to keep our anger even until sunset. What then shall we say about those who, because of the harshness and fury of their impassioned state, not only maintain their anger until the setting of this day's sun, but prolong it for many days? Or about others who do not express their anger, but keep silent and increase the poison of their rancor to their own destraction? They are unaware that we must avoid anger not only in what we do but also in our thoughts: otherwise our intellect will be darkened by our rancor, cut off from the light of spiritual knowledge and discrimination, and deprived of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> It is for this reason that the Lord commands us to leave our offering before the altar and be reconciled with our brother (cf Matt,  s:  23-24), since our offering will not be acceptable so long as anger and rancor are bottled up within us. The Apostle teaches us the same thing when he tells us to 'pray without ceasing' (1 Thess. 5:17), and to 'pray every where, lifting up holy hands without anger and without quarrelling' (1 Tim. 2:8). We are thus left with the choice either of never praying, and so of disobeying the Apostle's commandment, or of trying earnestly to fulfill his commandment by praying without anger or rancor.</p>
      <p> We are often indifferent to our brethren who are distressed or upset, on the grounds that they are in this state through no fault of ours. The Doctor of souls, however, wishing to root out the soul's excuses from the heart, tells us to leave our gift and to be reconciled not only if we happen to be upset by our brother, but also if he is upset by us, whether justly or unjustly: only when we have healed the breach through our apology should we offer our gift.</p>
      <p> We may find the same teaching in the Old Testament as well. As though in complete agreement with the Gospels, it says: 'Do not hate your brother in your heart' (Lev. 19:17); and: "The way of the rancorous leads to death' (Prov. 12: 28. LXX). These passages,</p>
      <p> [VI] 85</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Eight Vices On Anger</p>
      <p> then, not only forbid anger in what we do but also angry thought. If therefore we are to follow the divine laws, we must struggle with all our strength against the demon of anger and against the sickness which lies hidden within us. When we are angry with others we should not seek solitude on the grounds that there, at least, no one will provoke us to anger, and that in solitude the virtue of long-suffering can easily be acquired. Our desire to leave our brethren is because of our pride, and because we do not wish to blame ourselves and ascribe to our own laxity the cause of our unniliness. So long as we assign the causes for our weaknesses to others, we cannot attain perfection in long-suffering.</p>
      <p> Self-reform and peace are not achieved through the patience which others show us, but through our own long-suffering towards our neighbor. When we try to escape the struggle for long-suffering by retreating into solitude, those unhealed passions we take there with us are merely hidden, not erased: for unless our passions are first purged, solitude and withdrawal from the world not only foster them but also keep them concealed, no longer allowing us to perceive what passion it is that enslaves us. On the contrary, they impose on us an illusion of virtue and persuade us to believe that we have achieved long-suffering and humility, because there is no one present to provoke and test us. But as soon as something happens which does arouse and challenge us, our hidden and previously unnoticed passions immediately break out like uncontrolled horses that have long been kept unexercised and idle, dragging their driver all the more violently and wildly to destruction. Our passions grow fiercer when left idle through lack of contact with other people. Even that shadow of patience and long-suffering which we thought we possessed while we mixed with our brethren is lost in our isolation through not being exercised. Poisonous creatures that live quietly in their lairs in the desert display their fury only when they detect someone approaching, and likewise passion-filled men, who live quietly not because of their virtuous disposition but because of their solitude, spit forth their venom whenever someone approaches and provokes them. This is why those seeking perfect gentleness must make every effort to avoid anger not only towards men, but also towards animals and even inanimate objects.</p>
      <p> I can remember how, when I lived in the desert, I became angry with the rushes because they were either too thick or too thin; or</p>
      <p> [VI] 86</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Eight Vices On Anger</p>
      <p> with a piece of wood, when I wished to cut it quickly and could not; or with a flint, when I was in a hurry to light a fire and the spark would not come. So all-embracing was my anger that it was aroused even against inanimate objects.</p>
      <p> If then we wish to receive the Lord's blessing we should restrain not only the outward expression of anger, but also angry thoughts. More beneficial than controlling our tongue m a moment of anger and refraining from angry</p>
      <p> words is purifying our heart from rancor and not harboring mahcious thoughts against our brethren. The Gospel teaches us to cut off the roots of our sins and not merely their fruits. When we have dug the root of anger out of our heart, we will no longer act with hatred or envy. 'Whoever hates his brother is a murderer' (1 John 3:15), for he kills him with the hatred in his mind. The blood of a man who has been slain by the sword can be seen by men, but blood shed by the hatred in the mind is seen by God, who rewards each man with punishment or a crown not only for his acts but for his thoughts and intentions as well. As God Himself says through the Prophet: 'Behold, I am coming to reward them according to their actions and their thoughts' (cf Ecclus. 35:19); and the Apostle says: 'And their thoughts accuse or else excuse them in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men' (Rom. 2:15-16). The Lord Himself teaches us to put aside all anger when He says: 'Whoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of judgment' (Matt. 5:22). This is the text of the best manuscripts; for it is clear from the purpose of Scripture in this context that the words 'without a cause' were added later. The Lord's intention is that we should remove the root of anger, its spark, so to speak, in whatever way we can, and not keep even a single pretext for anger in our hearts. Otherwise we will be stirred to anger initially for what appears to be a good reason and then find that our mcensive power is totally out of control.</p>
      <p> The final cure for this sickness is to realize that we must not become angry for any reason whatsoever, whether just or unjust. When the demon of anger has darkened our mind, we are left with neither the light of discrimination, nor the assurance of true judgment, nor the guidance of righteousness, and our soul cannot become the temple of the Holy Spirit. Finally, we should always bear in mind our ignorance of the time of our death, keeping ourselves from anger and recognizing that neither self-restraint nor the</p>
      <p> [VI] 87</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Eight Vices On Anger</p>
      <p> renunciation of all material things, nor fasting and vigils, are of any benefit if we are found guilty at the last judgment because we are the slaves of anger and hatred.</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Eight Vices On Dejection</p>
      <p> Our fifth struggle is against the demon of dejection, who obscures the soul's capacity for spiritual contemplation and keeps it from all good works. When this malicious demon seizes our soul and darkens it completely, he prevents us from praying gladly, from reading Holy Scripture with profit and perseverance, and from being gentle and compassionate towards our brethren. He instills a hatred of every kind of work and even of the monastic profession itself. Undermining all the soul's salutary resolutions, weakening its persistence and constancy, he leaves it senseless and paralyzed, tied and bound by its despairing thoughts.</p>
      <p> If our purpose is to fight the spiritual fight and to defeat, with God's help, the demons of malice, we should take every care to guard our heart from the demon of dejection, just as a moth devours clothing and a worm devours wood, so dejection devours a man's soul. It persuades him to shun every helpful encounter and stops him accepting advice from his true friends or giving them a courteous and peaceful reply. Seizing the entire soul, it fills it with bitterness and listlessness. Then it suggests to the soul that we should go away from other people, since they are the</p>
      <p> cause of its agitation. It does not allow the soul to understand that its sickness does not come from without, but lies hidden within, only manifesting itself when temptations attack the soul because of our ascetic efforts.</p>
      <p> A man can be harmed by another only through the causes of the passions which lie within himself. It is for this reason that God, the Creator of all and the Doctor of men's souls, who alone has accurate knowledge of the soul's wounds, does not tell us to forsake the company of men: He tells us to root out the causes of evil within us and to recognize that the soul's health is achieved not by a man's separating himself from his fellows, but by his living the ascetic life in the company of holy men. When we abandon our brothers for some apparently good reason, we do not eradicate the motives for</p>
      <p> [VI] 88</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Eight Vices On Dejection</p>
      <p> dejection but merely exchange them, since the sickness which lies hidden within us will show itself again in other circumstances.</p>
      <p> Thus it is clear that our whole fight is against the passions within. Once these have been extirpated from our heart by the grace and help of God, we will readily be able to live not simply with other men, but even with wild beasts, job confirms this when he says:</p>
      <p> 'And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you' (Job 5:23). But first we must struggle with the demon of dejection who casts the soul into despair. We must drive him from our heart. It was this demon that did not allow Cain to repent after he had killed his brother, or Judas after he had betrayed his Master. The only form of dejection we should cultivate is the sorrow which goes with repentance for sin and is accompanied by hope in God. It was of this form of dejection that the Apostle said: 'Godly sorrow produces a saving repentance which is not to be repented of (2 Cor. 7:10). This 'godly sorrow' nourishes the soul through the hope engendered by repentance, and it is mingled with joy. That is why it makes us obedient and eager for every good work: accessible, humble, gentle, forbearing and patient in enduring all the suffering or tribulation God may send us. Possession of these qualities shows that a man enjoys the fruits of the Holy Spirit: love, joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, faith, self-control (cf. Gal. 5:11). But from the other kind of dejection we come to know the fruits of the evil spirit: listlessness, impatience, anger, hatred, contentiousness, despair, sluggishness in praying. So we should shun this second form of dejection as we would unchastity, avarice, anger and the rest of the passions. It can be healed by prayer, hope in God, meditation on Holy Scripture, and by living with godly people.</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Eight Vices On Listlessness</p>
      <p> Our sixth struggle is against the demon of listlessness, who works hand in hand with the demon of dejection. This is a harsh, terrible demon, always attacking the monk, falling upon him at the sixth hour (mid-day), making him slack and fall of fear, inspiring him with hatred for his monastery, his fellow monks, for work of any kind, and even for the reading of Holy Scripture. He suggests to the monk that he should go elsewhere and that, if he does not, all his effort</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Eight Vices On Listlessness</p>
      <p> and time will be wasted. In addition to all this, tie produces in him at around the sixth hour a hunger such as he would not normally have after fasting for three days, or after a long journey or the heaviest labor. Then he makes him think that he will not be able to rid himself of this grievous sickness, except by sallying forth frequently to visit his brethren, ostensibly to help them and to tend them if they are unwell. When he cannot lead him astray in this manner, he puts him into the deepest sleep. In short, his attacks become stronger and more violent, and he cannot be beaten off except through prayer, through avoiding useless speech, through the study of the Holy Scriptures and through patience in the face of temptation. If he finds a monk unprotected by these weapons, he strikes him down with his arrows, making him a wayward and lazy wanderer, who roams idly from monastery to monastery, thinking only of where he can get something to eat and drink. The mind of someone affected by listlessness is filled with nothing but vain distraction. Finally he is ensnared in worldly things and gradually becomes so grievously caught up in them that he abandons the monastic life altogether.</p>
      <p> The Apostle, who knows that this sickness is indeed serious, and wishes to eradicate it from our soul, indicates its main causes and says: 'Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brother who lives in an unruly manner and not according to the tradition which you have received from us. For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us: for we ourselves did not behave in an unruly manner when among you, nor did we eat any man's bread as a free gift; but we toiled strenuously night and day so that we might not be a burden to any of you: not because we do not have the right, but so as to give you an example to imitate. For even when we were with you, we gave you instructions that if anyone refuses to work he should have nothing to eat. For we hear that there are some among you who live in an unruly manner, not working at all, but simply being busybodies. Now we instruct such people and exhort them by our Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and to eat their own bread' (2 Thess.3:6-12). We should note how clearly the Apostle describes the causes of listlessness. Those who do not work he calls unruly, expressing a multiplicity of faults in this one word. For the unruly man, is lacking in reverence, impulsive in speech, quick, to abuse, and so</p>
      <p> [VI] 90</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Eight Vices</p>
      <p> On Listlessness</p>
      <p> unfit for stillness. He is a slave to listlessness. Paul therefore tells us to avoid such a person, that is, to isolate ourselves from him as from a plague. With the words 'and not according to the tradition which you have received from us he makes it clear that they are arrogant and that they destroy the apostolic traditions. Again he says: 'nor did we eat any man's bread as a free gift; but we toiled strenuously night and day'. The teacher of the nations, the herald of the Gospel, who was raised to the third heaven, who says that the Lord ordained that 'those who preach the Gospel should live by the Gospel' (ICor. 9:14) - this same man works night and day 'so that we might not be a burden to any of you'. What then can be said of us, who are listless about our work and physically lazy - we who have not been entrusted with the proclamation of the Gospel or the care of the churches, but merely with looking after our own soul? Next Paul shows more clearly the harm bom of laziness by adding: 'not working at all, but simply being busybodies'; for from laziness comes inquisitiveness, and from inquisitiveness, unruliness, and from unruliness, every kind of evil. He provides a remedy, however, with the words: 'Now we instruct such people ... to</p>
      <p> work quietly and to eat their own bread ' But with even greater emphasis, he says: 'if anyone refuses to work, he should have nothing to eat'.</p>
      <p> The holy fathers of Egypt, who were brought up on the basis of these apostolic commandments, do not allow monks to be without work at any time, especially while they are young. They know that by persevering in work monks dispel listlessness, provide for their own sustenance and help those who are in need. They not only work for their own requirements, but from their labor they also minister to their guests, to the poor and to those in prison, believing that such charity is a holy sacrifice acceptable to God. The fathers also say that as a rule someone who works is attacked and afflicted by but a single demon, while someone who does not work is taken prisoner by a thousand evil spirits.</p>
      <p> It is also good to recall what Abba Moses, one of the most experienced of the fathers, told me. I had not been living long in the desert when I was troubled by listlessness. So I went to him and said: 'Yesterday I was greatly troubled and weakened by listlessness, and I was not able to free myself from it until I went to see Abba Paul' Abba Moses replied to me by saying: 'So far from freeing yourself from it, you have surrendered to it completely and become its slave.</p>

      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Eight Vices On Listlessness</p>
      <p> You must realize that it will attack all the more severely because you have deserted your post, unless from now on you strive to subdue it through patience, prayer and manual labor.'</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Eight Vices</p>
      <p> On Self-Esteem</p>
      <p> Our seventh struggle is against the demon of self-esteem, a multiform and subtle passion which is not readily perceived even by the person whom it tempts. The provocations of the other passions are more apparent and it is therefore somewhat easier to do battle with them, for the soul recognizes its enemy and can repulse him at once by rebutting him and by prayer. The vice of self-esteem, however, is difficult to fight against, because it has many forms and appears in all our activities - in our way of speaking, in what we say and in our silences, at work, in vigils and fasts, in prayer and reading, in stillness and long-suffering. Through all these it seeks to strike down the soldier of Christ. When it cannot seduce a man with extravagant clothes, it tries to tempt him by means of shabby ones. When it cannot flatter him with honor, it inflates him by causing him to endure what seems to be dishonor. When it cannot persuade him to feel proud of his display of eloquence, it entices him through silence into thinking he has achieved stillness. When it cannot puff him up with the thought of his luxurious table, it lures him into fasting for the sake of praise.</p>
      <p> In short, every task, every activity, gives this malicious demon a chance for battle. He even prompts us to imagme we are priests. I remember a certain elder who, while I was staying in Sketis, went to visit a brother in his cell. When he approached his door, he heard him speaking inside: thinking that he was studying the Scriptures, he stood outside listening, only to realize that self-esteem had driven the man out of his mind and that he was ordaining himself deacon and dismissing the catechumens. When the elder heard this, he pushed open the door and went in. The</p>

      <p> this delusion. I have recalled this incident because I want to show to what depths of stupidity this demon can bring us.</p>
      <p> The person who wants to engage fully in spiritual combat and to win the crown of righteousness must try by every means to overcome this beast that assumes such varied forms. He should always keep in mind the words of David: 'The Lord has scattered the bones of those who please men' (Ps. 53:5. LXX). He should not do anything with a view to being praised by other people, but should seek God's reward only, always rejecting the thoughts of self-praise that enter his heart, and always regarding himself as nothing before God. In this way he will be freed, with God's help, from the demon of self-esteem.</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Eight Vices On Pride</p>
      <p> Our eighth struggle is against the demon of pride, a most sinister demon, fiercer than all that have been discussed up till now. He attacks the perfect above all and seeks to destroy those who have mounted almost to the heights of holiness. Just as a deadly plague destroys not just one member of the body, but the whole of it, so pride comipts the whole soul, not just part of it. Each of the other passions that trouble the soul attacks and tries to overcome the single virtue which is opposed to it, and so it darkens and troubles the soul only partially. But the passion of pride darkens the soul completely and leads to its utter downfall.</p>
      <p> In order to understand more fully what is meant by this, we should look at the problem in the following way. Gluttony tries to destroy self-control; unchastity, moderation; avarice, voluntary poverty; anger, gentleness; and the other forms of vice, their corresponding virtues. But when the vice of pride has become master of our wretched soul, it acts like some harsh tyrant who has gained control of a great city, and destroys it completely, razing it to its foundations. The angel who fell from heaven because of his pride bears witness to this. He had been created by God and adorned with every virtue and all wisdom, but he did not want to ascribe this to the grace of the Lord. He ascribed it to his own nature and as a result regarded himself as equal to God. The prophet rebukes this claim when he says: 'You have said in your heart: "I will sit on a high mountain; I will place my throne upon the clouds and I will be like the Most</p>
      <p> [VI] 93</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Eight Vices</p>
      <p> High." Yet you are a man, and not God' (cf Isa. 14:13-14). And again, another prophet says, 'Why do you boast of your wickedness, 0 mighty man?' and he continues in this same vein (Ps. 52:1). Since we are aware of this we should feel fear and guard our hearts with extreme care from the deadly spirit of pride. When we have attained some degree of holiness we should always repeat to ourselves the words of the Apostle: "Yet not 1, but the grace of God which was with me' (1 Cor. 15:10), as well as what was said by the Lord:</p>
      <p> 'Without Me you can do nothing' (John 15:5). We should also bear in mind what the prophet said: 'Unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain that build it' (Ps. 127:1), and finally: 'It does not depend on-man's will or effort, but on God's mercy' (Rom. 9:16).</p>
      <p> Even if someone is sedulous, serious and resolute, he cannot, so long as he is bound to flesh and blood, approach perfection except through the mercy and grace of Christ. James himself says that 'every good gift is from above' Jas. 1:17), while the Apostle Paul asks: 'What do you have which you did not receive? Now if you received it, why do you boast, as if you had not received it?' (1 Cor. 4:7). What right, then, has man to be proud as though he could achieve perfection through his own efforts ?</p>
      <p> The thief who received the kingdom of heaven, though not as the reward of virtue, is a true witness to the fact that salvation is ours through the grace and mercy of God. All of our holy fathers knew this and all with one accord teach that perfection in holiness can be achieved only through humility. Humility, in its turn, can be achieved only through faith, fear of God, gentleness and the shedding of all possessions. It is by means of these that we attain perfect love, through the grace and compassion of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory through all the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> On the Holy Fathers of Sketis And on Discrimination</p>
      <p> Written for Abba Leontios</p>
      <p> The promise 1 made to the blessed Bishop Kastor to give an account of the way of life and the teaching of the holy fathers has been fulfilled in part by the writings 1 sent him entitled 'On Coenobitic Institutions' and 'On the Eight Vices', and 1 now propose to fulfill it completely. But having heard that Bishop Kastor has left us to dwell with Christ, 1 felt 1 should send the remaining portion of my treatise to you, most holy Leontios, who have inherited both his virtuous qualities and the guardianship, with God's help, of his monastery.</p>
      <p> 1 and my spiritual friend, the holy Gemianos, whom 1 had known since my youth at school, in the army and in monastic life, were staying in the desert of Sketis, the centre of the most experienced monks. It was there that we saw Abba Moses, a saintly man, outstanding not only in the practice of the virtues but in spiritual contemplation as well. We begged him with tears, therefore, to tell us how we might approach perfection.</p>
      <p> After much entreaty on our part, he said; 'Children, all virtues and all pursuits have a certain immediate purpose; and those who look to this purpose and adapt themselves accordingly will reach the ultimate goal to which they aspire. The fanner willingly works the earth, enduring now the sun's heat and now the winter's cold, his immediate purpose being to clear it of thorns and weeds, while his ultimate goal is the enjoyment of its fruits. The merchant, ignoring dangers on land and sea, willingly gives himself to his business with the purpose of making a profit, while</p>
      <p> his goal is enjoyment of this profit. The soldier, too, ignores the dangers of war and the miseries of service abroad. His purpose is to gain a higher rank by using his ability and skill, while his goal is to enjoy the advantages of this rank.</p>

      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Holy Fathers of Sketis And on Discrimination</p>
      <p> Written for Abba Leontios</p>
      <p> 'Now our profession also has its own immediate purpose and its own ultimate goal, for the sake of which we willingly endure all manner of toil and suffering. Because of this, fasts do not cast us down, the hardship of vigils delights us: the reading and study of Scripture are readily undertaken; and physical work, obedience, stripping oneself of everything earthly, and the life here in this desert are carried out with pleasure.</p>
      <p> 'You have given up your country, your families, everything worldly in order to embrace a life in a foreign land among rude and uncultured people like us. Tell me, what was your purpose and what goal did you set before yourselves in doing all this?'</p>
      <p> We replied: 'We did it for the kingdom of heaven.' In response Abba Moses said: 'As for the goal, you have answered well: but what is the purpose which we set before us and which we pursue unwaveringly so as to reach the kingdom of heaven? This you have not told me.'</p>
      <p> When we confessed that we did not know, the old man replied: 'The goal of our profession, as we have said, is the kingdom of God. Its immediate purpose, however, is purity of heart, for without this we cannot reach our goal. We should therefore always have this purpose in mind: and, should it ever happen that for a short time our heart turns aside from the direct path, we must bring it back again" at once, guiding our lives with reference to our purpose as if it were a carpenter's rule.</p>
      <p> 'The Apostle Paul knew this when he said: "Forgetting what lies behind, and reaching forward to what lies in front, I pursue my purpose, aiming at the prize of the high calling of God" (Phil. 3:13-14). We, too, do everything for the sake of this immediate purpose. We give up country, family, possessions and everything worldly in order to acquire purity of heart. If we forget this purpose we cannot avoid frequently stumbling and losing our way, for we will be walking in the dark and straying from the proper path. This has happened to many men who at the start of their ascetic life gave up all wealth, possessions and everything worldly, but who later flew into a rage over a fork, a needle, a rush or a book. This would not have happened to them had they borne in mind the purpose for which they gave up everything. It is for the love of our neighbor that we scorn wealth, lest by fighting over it and stimulating our disposition to anger, we fall away from love. When we show this</p>
      <p> [VI] 96</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Holy Fathers of Sketis And on Discrimination</p>
      <p> Written for Abba Leontios</p>
      <p> disposition to anger towards our brother even in small things, we have lapsed from our purpose and our renunciation of the world is useless. The blessed Apostle was aware of this and said: "Though I give my body to be burned, and have no love, it profits me nothing" (1 Cor. 13:3). From this we learn that perfection does not follow immediately upon renunciation and withdrawal from the world. It comes after the attainment of love which, as the Apostle said, "is not jealous or puffed up, does not grow angry, bears no grudge, is not arrogant, thinks no evil" (cf. 1 Cor. 13:4-5). All these things establish purity of heart; and it is for this that we should do everything, scorning possessions, enduring fasts and vigils gladly, engaging in spiritual reading and psalmody. If, however, some necessary task pleasing to God should keep us from our normal fasting and reading, we should not on this account neglect purity of heart. For what we gain by fasting is not so great as the damage done by anger: nor is the profit from reading as great as the harm done when we scorn or grieve a brother.</p>
      <p> 'Fasts and vigils, the study of Scripture, renouncing possessions and everything worldly are not in themselves perfection, as we have said; they are its tools. For perfection is not to be found in them; it is acquired through them. It is useless, therefore, to boast of our fasting, vigils, poverty, and reading of Scripture when we have not achieved the love of God and our fellow men. Whoever has achieved love has God within himself and his intellect is always with God.'</p>
      <p> To this Germanos rejoined: 'What man, while in the flesh, can so fix his intellect on God that he thmks of nothing else, not even of visiting the sick, of entertaining guests, of his handicraft, or of the other unavoidable bodily needs? Above all, since God is invisible and incomprehensible, how can a man's mind always look upon Him and be inseparable from Him?'</p>
      <p> Abba Moses replied: 'To look upon God at all times and to be inseparable from Him, in the manner which you envisage, is impossible for a man still in the flesh and enslaved to weakness. In another way, however, it is possible to look upon God, for the manner of contemplating God may be conceived and understood in many ways. God is not only to be known in His blessed and incomprehensible being, for this is something which is reserved for His saints in the age to come. He is also to be known from the grandeur</p>
      <p> [VI] 97</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Holy Fathers of Sketis And on Discrimination</p>
      <p> Written for Abba Leontios</p>
      <p> and beauty of His creatures, from His providence which governs the world day by day, from His righteousness and from the wonders which He shows to His saints in each generation. When we reflect on the measurelessness of His power and His unsleeping eye which looks upon the hidden things of the heart and which nothing can escape, we are filled with the deepest awe, marveling at Him and adoring Him. When we consider that He numbers the raindrops, the sand of the sea and the stars of heaven, we are amazed at the grandeur of His nature and His wisdom. When we think of His ineffable and inexplicable wisdom. His love for mankind, and His limitless long-suffering at man's innumerable sins, we glorify Him. When we consider His great love for us, in that though we had done nothing good He, being God, deigned to become man in order to save us from delusion, we are roused to longing for Him. When we reflect that He Himself has vanquished in us our adversary, the devil, and that He has given us eternal life if only</p>
      <p> we would choose and turn towards His goodness, then we venerate Him. There are many similar ways of seeing and apprehending God, which grow in us according to our labor and to the degree of our purification/</p>
      <p> Germanos then asked: 'How does it happen that even against our will many ideas and wicked thoughts trouble us, entering by stealth and undetected to steal our attention? Not only are we unable to prevent them from entering, but it is extremely difficult even to recognize them. Is it possible for the mind to be completely free of them and not be troubled by them at all?'</p>
      <p> Abba Moses replied: 'It is impossible for the mind not to be troubled by these thoughts. But if we exert ourselves it is withm our power either to accept them and give them our attention, or to expel them. Their coming is not within our power to control, but their expulsion is. The amending of our mind is also within the power of our choice and effort. When we meditate wisely and: continually on the law of God, study psalms and canticles, engage-in fasting and vigils, and always bear in mind what is to come - the kingdom of heaven, the Gehenna of fire and all God's works — our wicked thoughts diminish and find no place. But when we devote our time to worldly concerns and to matters of the flesh, to pointless and useless conversation, then these base thoughts multiply in us. just as it is impossible to stop a watermill from turning, although</p>
      <p> [VI] 98</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Holy Fathers of Sketis And on Discrimination</p>
      <p> Written for Abba Leontios</p>
      <p> the miller has power to choose between grinding either wheat or tares, so it is impossible to stop our mind, which is ever-moving, from having thoughts, although it is within our power to feed it either with spiritual meditation or with worldly concerns.'</p>
      <p> When the old man saw us marveling at this and still longing to hear more, he was silent for a short while and then said: 'Your longing has made me speak at length, and yet you are still eager for more, and from this I see that you are truly thirsty to be taught about perfection. So I would like to talk to you about the special virtue of discrimination. This is a kind of acropolis or queen among the virtues; and I will show you its excellence and value, not only in my own words, but also through the venerable teachings of the fathers; for the Lord fills His teachers with grace according to the quality and longing of those who listen.</p>
      <p> 'Discrimination, then, is no small virtue, but one of the most important gifts of the Holy Spirit. Concerning these gifts the Apostle says: "To one is given by the Spirit the principle of wisdom; to another the principle of spiritual knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing... to another discrimination of spirits' (ICor. 12:8-10). Then, having completed his catalogue of spiritual gifts, he adds: "But all these are energized by the one and selfsame Spirit" (1 Cor. 12:11). You can see, therefore, that the gift of discrimination is nothing worldly or insignificant. It is the greatest gift of God's grace. A monk must seek this gift with all his strength and diligence, and acquire the ability to discriminate between the spirits that enter him and to assess them accurately. Otherwise he will not only fall into the foulest pits of wickedness as he wanders about in the dark, but even stumble when his path is smooth and straight.</p>
      <p> 'I remember how in my youth, when I was in the Thebaid, where the blessed Antony used to live, some elders came to see him, to enquire with him into the question of perfection in virtue. They asked him; "Which is the greatest of all virtues - we mean the virtue capable of keeping a monk from being harmed by the nets of the devil</p>
      <p> and his deceit?" Each one then gave his opinion according to his understanding. Some said that fasting and the keeping of vigils make it easier to come near to God, because these refine and purify the mind. Others said that voluntary poverty and detachment from personal possessions make it easier, since through these the mind is</p>
      <p> [VI] 99</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Holy Fathers of Sketis And on Discrimination</p>
      <p> Written for Abba Leontios</p>
      <p> released from the intricate threads of worldly care. Others judged acts of compassion to be the most important, since in the Gospel the Lord says: "Come, you whom my Father has blessed, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave Me food" and so on (Matt. 25: 34-36). The best part of the  night was passed in this manner, taken up with a discussion in which each expressed his opinion as to which virtue makes it easiest for a man to come near to God.</p>
      <p> 'Last of all the blessed Antony gave his reply: "All that you have said is both necessary and helpful for those who are searching for God and wish to come to Him. But we cannot award the first place to any of these virtues; for there are many among us who have endured fasting and vigils, or have withdrawn into the desert, or have practiced poverty to such an extent that they have not left themselves enough for their daily sustenance, or have performed acts of compassion so generously that they no longer have anything to give; and yet these same monks, having done all this, have nevertheless fallen away miserably from virtue and slipped into vice.</p>
      <p> ' "What was it, then, that made them stray from the straight path? In my opinion it was simply that they did not possess the grace of discrimination; for it is this virtue that teaches a man to walk along the royal road, swerving neither to the right through immoderate self-control, nor to the left through indifference and laxity. Discrimination is a kind of eye and lantern of the soul, as is said in the gospel passage: "The light of the body is the eye; if therefore your eye is pure, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness' (Matt. 6:22-3). And this is just what we find; for the power of discrimination, scrutinizing all the thoughts and actions of a man, distinguishes and sets aside everything that is base and not pleasing to God, and keeps him free from delusion.</p>
      <p> ' "We can see this in what is said in the Holy Scriptures. Saul, the first to be entrusted with the kingship of Israel, did not have the eye of discrimination; so his mind was darkened and he was unable to perceive that it was more pleasing to God that he should obey the commandment of Samuel than that he should offer sacrifices. He gave offence through the very things with which he thought to serve God, and because of them he was deposed. This would not have happened had he possessed the light of discrimination (cf 1 Sam. 13: 8-9).</p>
      <p> [VI] 100</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Holy Fathers of Sketis And on Discrimination</p>
      <p> Written for Abba Leontios</p>
      <p> ' "The Apostle calls this virtue 'the sun', as we can see from his saying: 'Do not let the sun go down upon your anger' (Eph. 4:26). It is also called 'the guidance' of our lives, as when it is written: "Those who have no guidance fell like leaves' (Prov. 11:14. LXX). Scripture also refers to it as the 'discernment' without which we must do nothing- not even drink the spiritual wine that 'makes glad the heart of man' (Ps. 104:15. LXX); for it is said: 'Drink with discernment' (Prov. 31:3. LXX): and: 'He that does not do all things with discernment is like a city that is broken down and without walls' (Prov. 25:28. LXX). Wisdom, intellection and perceptiveness are united in discrimination: and without these our inner house cannot be built, nor can we gather spiritual wealth; for it is written: 'Through wisdom a house is built, through understanding it is established, and through good judgment its storehouses will be filled with wealth' (Prov. 24:3-4. LXX). Discrimination is also called the 'solid food' that 'is suitable for those who have their organs of perception trained by practice to discriminate between good and evil' (Heb. 5:14). These passages show very clearly that without the gift of discrimination no virtue can stand or remain firm to the end, for it is the mother of all the virtues and their guardian."</p>
      <p> 'This was Antony's statement, and it was approved by the other fathers. But in order to confirm what St Antony said by means of fresh examples from our own times, we should recall Abba Hiron and how a few days ago, as we ourselves saw, he was thrown down from the height of the ascetic state to the depths of death by the deception of the devil. We know how he spent some fifty years in the nearby desert, following a life of great severity and the strictest self-control, seeking out and living in parts of the desert wilder than those inhabited by any of the other monks there. This same man cast all the fathers and brothers of the nearby desert into inconsolable grief because, after so many labors and struggles, he was deceived by the devil and suffered such a disastrous fall. This would not have happened to him had he been armed with the virtue of discrimination, which would have taught him to trust, not his own judgment, but rather the advice of his fathers and brethren. Following his own judgment he fasted and isolated himself to such a degree that he did not even come to church for the Holy Pascha, lest by meeting the fathers and brethren and feeding with them he</p>
      <p> [VI] 101</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Holy Fathers of Sketis And on Discrimination</p>
      <p> Written for Abba Leontios</p>
      <p> would be obliged to eat lentils or whatever else was brought to the table, thereby appearing to fall short of the target which he had set himself.</p>
      <p> 'He had already for long been deceived in this way by his own willfulness when, coming upon an angel of Satan, he bowed before him as if he were an angel of light. The angel commanded him to hurl himself, around midnight, into a very deep well so that he might then know by experience, because of his great virtue and ascetic efforts, that he would never again be subject to any danger. His darkened mind failed to discern who was suggesting this to him, and he hurled himself into the well during the night. Soon afterwards the brethren, discovering what had happened, were only just able to pull him up half dead. He lived for two more days and died on the third, plunging his brethren and the priest Paphnoutios into great grief. The latter, moved by feelings of compassion and remembering Hiron's numerous labors and the many years during which he had persevered in the desert, mentioned his name in the oblation for the dead so that he should not be numbered among those who have taken their own lives.</p>
      <p> 'And what am I to say about those two brethren who hved beyond the desert of the Thebaid, where the blessed Antony once hved? ImpeUed by a thought the real nature of which they could not discern, they decided to go into the vast, uncultivated inner desert: and they even made up their minds to refuse food offered them by man, and to accept only what the Lord would give them in a miraculous fashion. Finally they were seen in the distance wandering about the desert, weak with hunger, by the Mazikes who, though fiercer and wilder than almost all other savage peoples, now providentially exchanged their natural wildness for humane feelings and went to meet them carrying loaves of bread. One of the two brethren accepted the bread with joy and thanksgiving, since his power of discrimination had returned and he realized that such wild and fierce men, who normally rejoice at the sight of blood, would not have felt sympathy with them in their exhaustion and brought them food if God had not moved them to it. The other, however, refused the food on the grounds that it was offered him by men arid, persisting in his undiscnmmatmg judgment, he died from the weakness brought on by his hunger.</p>
      <p> 'Both monks at first showed total lack of judgment and made a</p>

      <p> senseless and destructive plan. One of them, however, when his power of discrimination returned, corrected the decision he had made so recklessly. But the other, persisting in his stupid and. undiscriminating plan, brought upon himself the death which the Lord had wanted to avert.</p>
      <p> 'What am I to say about another monk whose name I do not wish to mention because he is still alive? He frequently entertained a demon as if he were an angel and received revelations from him, often seeing what looked like the light of a lamp in his cell. Later, he was ordered by this demon to offer his son as a sacrifice to God - his son was staying with him in the monastery - on the grounds that he would as a result be deemed worthy of the honor accorded to the patriarch Abraham. He was so led astray by the demon's advice that he would have carried out the sacrifice of his son, had the latter not seen him, contrary to his normal practice, sharpening a knife and preparing the bonds with which he was going to tie him up like a burnt offering. This enabled the son to make his escape.</p>
      <p> 'It would take me a long time to give an account of the deception of that Mesopotamian monk who, having shown great self-control, shutting himself up in his cell for many years and surpassing all monks in those regions in asceticism and virtue, was then so deluded by demonic dreams and revelations that he reverted to Judaism and circumcision, in order to deceive him, the devil often showed him dreams that turned out to be true, in this way making him more ready to accept his final act of deception. One night he showed him the Christian people with the apostles and martyrs, downcast and filled with shame, wasting away with dejection and grief, while on the other side he showed him the Jewish people, with Moses and the prophets, surrounded by light and living in joy and gladness. The deceiver then advised him to be circumcised if he wanted to share in the blessedness and joy of the Jewish people. He was deceived and followed this advice. From all this it is clear that none of these people would have been deluded in this pathetic and miserable fashion had they possessed the gift of discrimination.'</p>
      <p> In reply to this Germanos said: 'By means of these recent examples and the statements of the fathers of old, you</p>
      <p> have made it clear that discrimination is the source, root, crown and common bond of aU the virtues. But we would like very much to know how we can</p>

      <p> St John Cassian</p>

      <p> Written for Abba Leontios</p>
      <p> acquire it, and how we can recognize the true kind of discrimination which comes from God and distinguish it from the false and fictitious kind that comes from the devil.'</p>
      <p> Abba Moses then said: 'True discnmination comes to us only as a result of true humility, and this in turn is shown by our revealing to our spiritual fathers not only what we do but also what we think, by never trusting our own thoughts, and by following in all things the words of our elders, regarding as good what they have judged to be so. In this way not only does the monk remain unharmed through true discrimination and by following the correct path, but he is also kept safe from all the snares of the devil. It is impossible for anyone who orders his life on the basis of the judgment and knowledge of the spiritually mature to fall because of the wiles of the demons. In fact, even before someone is granted the gift of discrimination, the act of revealing his base thoughts openly to the fathers weakens and withers them. For just as a snake which is brought from its dark hole into the light makes every effort to escape and hide itself, so the malicious thoughts that a person brings out into the open by sincere confession seek to depart from him.</p>
      <p> 'In order to give you a more accurate understanding of this virtue by means of an example, I shall tell you of something that Abba Serapion once did and which he used to speak about to those who came to him for help. He used to say: "When I was a young man I lived with my spiritual father, and at mealtimes, prompted by the devil, I would steal a rusk as I got up from the table and eat it without my father's knowledge. Because I persisted in this habit, I was utterly overcome by it and was unable to conquer it. Though I was condemned by my own conscience, I was ashamed to speak of it to my father. But through God's love it happened that certain brethren came to the old man for advice and asked him about their thoughts. The elder replied that nothing so harms a monk and brings such joy to the demons as the hiding of one's thoughts from one's spiritual father. He also spoke to them about self-control. As this was being said I came to myself and, thinking that God had revealed my past mistakes to the elder, I was pricked with compunction and began to cry, throwing from my pocket the rusk which I had stolen as usual. Casting myself to the ground I begged his forgiveness for my past faults and his prayers for my future safety. Then the old man said:</p>
      <p> 'My child, your confession has freed you, although I was silent. You [VI] 104</p>

      <p> have slain the demon that was wounding you because of your silence, by expressing openly what you were keeping to yourself. Until this moment you ensured that he would be your master by not opposing or rebuking him. From now on, however, he will no longer find room in you, since he has been brought out of your heart into the open.' The old man had not finished speaking when the energy of the demon could be seen coming out of my breast like the flame of a lamp. It filled the room with a nasty smell, so dial those present thought that a lump of sulphur was burning. Then the elder said: 'Look, through this sign the Lord has borne witness to my words and to your deliverance.' Thus, as the result of my confession, the passion of gluttony and the demonic energy left me and I never again felt any such desire."</p>
      <p> 'From what Abba Serapion said, we can learn that we shall be granted the gift of true discrimination when we trust, no longer in the judgments of our own mind, but in the teaching and rule of our fathers. The devil brings the monk to the brink of destruction more effectively through persuading him to disregard the admonitions of the fathers and follow his own judgment and desire, than he does through any other fault. We should learn from examples provided by human arts and sciences. If we cannot accomplish anything in them by ourselves - in spite of the fact that they deal with things we can touch with our hands, see with our eyes and hear with our ears - but still need someone who will instruct us well and guide us, how can it be anything but foolish to think that the spiritual art, the most difficult of all  the  arts, has no need of a teacher? It is an invisible, hidden art which is understood only through purity of heart, and failure in it brings, not temporary loss, but the soul's destruction and eternal death.'</p>
      <p> Gennanos then said: 'Certain fathers who have listened to the thoughts of the brethren have often not only failed to heal them, but have even condemned them and driven them to despair. This has provided us with an excuse for shameful and harmful caution: for we ourselves know of cases of this kind in the region of Syria. A certain brother revealed his private thoughts to one of the elders living in those parts, unashamedly laying bare the hidden things of his heart with complete simplicity and trath. When the elder heard these things, however, he at once began to be angry with the brother and to attack him, rebuking him for having such base thoughts. As a</p>

      <p> On the Holy Fathers of Sketis And on Discrimination</p>
      <p> Written for Abba Leontios</p>
      <p> result, many who heard of this were ashamed to tell their thoughts to the elders.'</p>
      <p> Abba Moses said: 'It is a good thing, as I said, not to hide your thoughts from the fathers. But you should not tell them to just anyone, you should confess them to spiritual masters who have discrimination, not simply to those whose hair has grown white with age. Many who have looked to age as a guide, and then revealed their thoughts, have not only remained unhealed but have been driven to despair because of the inexperience of those to whom they confessed. There was once a very zealous brother who was greatly troubled by the demon of unchastits'. He went to a certain father and confessed his private thoughts to him; but this father, being inexperienced, became angry when he heard about them and told the brother that he was contemptible and unworthy of the monastic habit for having entertained thoughts such as these. When the brother heard this, he lost heart, left his cell and set off back to the world. Through God's providence, however, Abba Apollos, one of the most experienced of the elders, chanced to meet him and, seeing him over-wrought and very despondent, asked him why he was in this state. At first the brother did not reply because he was so depressed but, after the elder had pleaded with him, he told him what was</p>
      <p> wrong, saying: "Because I was often troubled by evil thoughts, I went to tell them to the elder: and as he said I have no hope of salvation, I have given up and am now on my way back to the world."</p>
      <p> 'When Abba Apollos heard this, he comforted and encouraged him, saying: "Do not be surprised, my child, and do not lose hope. I too, old and grey as I am, am still much troubled by these thoughts. Do not be discouraged by this burning desire, which is healed not so much by human effort as by God's compassion. Please do this for me: go back to your cell just for today." This the brother did; and Apollos, after leaving him, went to the cell of the elder who had caused his despair. Standing outside he implored God with tears and said: "0 Lord, who puts us to the test for our own benefit, let this elder be given the brother's battle, so that in old age he may leam through experience what he has not been taught over these many years: how to feel sympathy with those who are under attack by the demons." As he finished his prayer, he saw a dark figure standing near the cell shooting arrows at the elder. Wounded by the arrows.</p>
      <p> [VI] 106</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Holy Fathers of Sketis And on Discrimination</p>
      <p> Written for Abba Leontios</p>
      <p> the elder at once began to stumble back and forth as though drunk. Unable to withstand the attack, he finally left his cell and set off for the world by the same road that the young monk had taken.</p>
      <p> 'Seeing what had happened, Abba Apollos confronted him, and asked him where he was going and why he was so troubled. Although he realized that the holy man knew what was wrong with him, he was too ashamed to say anything. Abba Apollos then said to him: "Return to your cell, and in the future recognize your own weakness. The devil has either not noticed or has despised you, and so not thought you worth fighting. Not that there has been any question of a fight: you could not stand up to his provocation even for a day! This has happened to you because, when you received a younger brother who was being attacked by our common enemy, you drove him to despair instead of preparing him for battle. You did not recall that wise precept: 'Deliver them that are being led away to death; and redeem them that are appointed to be slain' (Prov. 24:11. LXX). You did not even remember the parable of our Saviour, which teaches us not to break a bruised reed or quench smoking flax (cf Matt. 12:20). None of us could endure the plots of the enemy, or allay the fiery turmoil of our nature, if God's grace did not protect our human weakness. Seeing, then, that God has had this compassion for us, let us pray to Him together and ask Him to withdraw the whip with which He has lashed you. 'For He wounds but binds up; He strikes but His hands heal' (Job 5:18). "The Lord kills and gives life; he brings down to the grave and raises again.  ...  He brings low and lifts up' (1 Sam. 2:6-7)." After Abba Apollos had said this and had prayed, the attack which had been launched against the elder was at once suspended. Finally, Abba Apollos advised him to ask God to give him "the tongue of the learned" so as to know "how to speak a word m season" (Isa. 50:4).</p>
      <p> 'From all that has been said, we may conclude that nothing leads so surely to salvation as to confess our private thoughts to those fathers most graced with the power of discrimination, and in our pursuit of holiness to be guided by them rather than by our own thoughts and judgment. Nor should the fact that we may encounter an elder who is somewhat simple-minded or lacking in experience either prevent us from confessing to the fathers who are truly qualified, or make us despise our ancestral traditions. Many texts from the divine Scriptures make it clear that the fathers did not say</p>
      <p> St John Cassian</p>
      <p> On the Holy Fathers of Sketis And on Discrimination</p>
      <p> Written for Abba Leontios</p>
      <p> these things according to their own-hghts, but were inspired by God Himself and by the Scriptures to hand down to their successors the tradition of asking advice from those who had traveled far along the spiritual path. This is borne out especially by the story of the holy Samuel, who from infancy was dedicated by his mother to God and was granted communion with Him. He still did not trust his own thoughts, and in spite of having been called three times by God, he went to the elder, Eli, and was instructed and guided by him about how he should answer God (cf. 1 Sam. 3:9-10). Although God called him personally, none the less He wanted Samuel to receive the guidance and discipline of the elder, so that by means of this example we too might be led towards humility.</p>
      <p> 'When Christ Himself spoke to Paul and called him. He could have opened his eyes at once and made known to him the way of perfection: instead He sent him to Ananias and told him to learn from him the way of truth, saying: "Arise and go into the city, and there you will be told what you must do" (Acts 9:6). In this manner He teaches us to be guided by those who are advanced on the way, so that the vision rightly given to Paul should not be wrongly interpreted; otherwise it might lead later generations presumptuously to suppose that each individual must be initiated into the truth directly by God, as Paul was, and not by the fathers.</p>
      <p> "That this is the correct interpretation of these incidents can be seen not only from what is said here, but also from St Paul's own actions. He writes that he went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and James, and "laid before them the gospel 1 preach ... in case 1 was running or had run in vain" (Gal. 2: 2): and he did this even though the grace of the Holy Spirit was already with him, as can be seen from the miracles which he performed. Who, then, can be so proud and boastful as to be satisfied with his own judgment or opinion, when St Paul himself admits that he needs the advice of those who were apostles before him? All this shows with complete clarity that the Lord reveals the way of perfection only to those guided to it by their spiritual fathers. This accords with what He Himself has said through the Prophet: "Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you" (Deut. 32:7).</p>
      <p> 'We should therefore make every effort to acquire for ourselves that gift of discrimination which is able to keep us from excess in either direction. For, as the fathers have said, all extremes are</p>

      <p> equally harmful. It is as dangerous to fast too much as it is to overfill the stomach; to stay awake too long as to sleep too much; and so on. 1 myself have known monks who were not defeated by gluttony, but were undermined by</p>
      <p> immoderate fasting and lapsed into gluttony because of the weakness caused by this fasting. Indeed, I can remember having experienced this one myself. I had kept such strict control over my food that I forgot what it meant to be hungry, remaining without food for two or three days and still feeling no desire for it whatsoever, unless prompted by others. Then, through the wiles of the devil, I was so tormented by insomnia that, having remained awake for many nights, I begged God to grant me a little sleep. Thus I was in greater danger because of my immoderate fasting and insomnia than I was from gluttony and too much sleep.'</p>
      <p> Abba Moses so cheered us with teaching of this kind that we could not help glorifying the Lord who grants such great wisdom to those who fear Him; for to Him belong honor and power through all the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> (? Early 5th century) (lolume l.pp. 109-60)</p>
      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> Little can be affirmed with confidence about the life of St Mark the Ascetic, also known as Mark the Monk or Mark the Hermit. St Nikodimos dates him to the early fifth century, and this seems to be correct; according to another but less probable view, he lived at the beginning of the sixth century. Like his contemporaiy St Neilos, he may have been a disciple of St John Chrysostom, but this is not certain. As the  Letter to Nicolas the Solitary  indicates, Mark was living at one stage of his life as a hermit in the desert, although we cannot be sure where this was; both Palestine and Egypt have been suggested. Prior to this he may have been superior of a community near Ankyra (Ankara), in Asia Minor. In addition to the three works included in the Philokalia,  Mark wrote at least six other treatises, the most important being those on baptism, on repentance, and against Nestorios. In his spiritual teaching, which is directed particularly against the heretical Syrian movement of Messalianism, he lays great emphasis upon the role played by baptismal grace and provides a detailed analysis of the nature of temptations.'</p>
      <p> In addition to the Greek text provided by St Nikodimos, we have had before us the variant readings found in the earliest Greek manuscripts of Mark's writings; we have indicated in the footnotes when we depart from the text of the printed Greek Philokalia.  In our translation of the treatises  On the Spiritual Law and On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works,  the numbering of sections follows that in the  Greek Philokalia.  In Migne,  Patrologia Graeca,  Ixv, the numbering is slightly different.</p>
      <p> In the Orthodox Church Mark is commemorated as a saint on 5 March.</p>

      <p> 1.  Because you have often asked what the Apostle means when he says that 'the law is spiritual' (Rom. 7:14), and what kind of spiritual knowledge and action characterizes those who wish to observe it, we shall speak of this as far as we can.</p>
      <p> 2.  First of all, we know that God is the beginning, middle and end of everything good; and it is impossible for us to have faith in anything good or to carry it into effect except in Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> 3.  Everything good is given by the Lord providentially; and he who has faith that this is so will not lose what he has been given.</p>
      <p> 4.  Steadfast faith is a strong tower; and for one who has faith Christ comes to be all.</p>
      <p> 5.  May He who inaugurates every good thing inaugurate all that you undertake, so that it may be done with His blessing.</p>
      <p> 6.  When reading the Holy Scriptures, he who is humble and engaged in spiritual work will apply everything to himself and not to someone else.</p>
      <p> 7.  Call upon God to open the eyes of your heart, so that you may see the value of prayer and of spiritual reading when understood and applied.</p>
      <p> 8.  If a man has some spiritual gift and feels compassion for those who do not have it, he preserves the gift because of his compassion. But a boastful man will lose it through succumbing to the temptations of boastfulness.</p>
      <p> 9.  The mouth of a humble man speaks the truth; but he who speaks against the truth is like the servant who struck the Lord on the face (cf Mark 14:65).</p>
      <p> [VI] 111</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic On the Spiritual Law Two Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> 10.  Do not become a disciple of one who praises himself, in case you learn pride instead of humility.</p>
      <p> 11.  Do not grow conceited about your interpretations of Scripture, lest your intellect fall victim to blasphemy.</p>
      <p> 12.  Do not attempt to explain something difficult with contentiousness, but in the way which the spiritual law enjoins: with patience, prayer and unwavering hope.</p>
      <p> alone, and not yet with spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 14.  When the man once blind received his sight and saw the Lord, he acknowledged Him no longer as Son of David</p>
      <p> but as Son of God, and worshipped Him (cf John 9; 38).</p>
      <p> 15.  Do not grow conceited if you shed tears when you pray. For it is Christ who has touched your eyes and given you spiritual sight.</p>
      <p> 16.  He who, like the blind man, casts away his garment and draws near to the Lord, becomes His disciple and a preacher of true doctrine (cf. Mark 10:50).</p>
      <p> 17.  To brood on evil makes the heart brazen; but to destroy evil through self-restraint and hope breaks the heart.</p>
      <p> 18.  There is a breaking of the heart which is gentle and makes it deeply penitent, and there is a breaking which is violent and harmful, shattering it completely.</p>
      <p> 19.  Vigils, prayer and patient acceptance of what comes constitute a breaking that does not harm but benefits the heart, provided we do not destroy the balance between them through excess. He who perseveres in them will be helped in other ways as well; but he who is slack and negligent will suffer intolerably on leaving this life.</p>
      <p> 20.  A self-indulgent heart becomes a prison and chain for the soul when it leaves this life; whereas an assiduous heart is an open door.</p>
      <p> 21.   'The iron gate that leads into the city' is a hard heart (Acts 12 : 10); but to one who suffers hardship and affliction</p>
      <p> the gate will open of its own accord, as it did to Peter.</p>
      <p> 22.  There are many differing methods of prayer. No method is harmful; if it were, it would be not prayer but the activity of Satan.</p>
      <p> 23.   A man wanted to do evil, but first prayed as usual; and finding himself prevented by God, he was then extremely</p>
      <p> thankful.</p>
      <p> 24.   When David wanted to kill Nabal the Carmelite, but was [VI] 112</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic On the Spiritual Law Two Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> reminded of the divine retribution and abandoned his intention, he was extremely thankful. Again, we know what he did when he forgot God, and how he did not stop until Nathan the Prophet reminded him (cf. 1 Sam. 25; 2 Sam. 12).</p>
      <p> 25.  At the times when you remember God, increase your prayers, so that when you forget Him, the Lord may remind you.</p>
      <p> 26.  When you read Holy Scripture, perceive its hidden meanings. 'For whatever was written in past times was written for our instruction' (Rom. 15:4).</p>
      <p> 27.  Scripture speaks of faith as 'the substance of things hoped for' (Heb. 11:1), and describes as 'worthless' those who do not know the indwelling of Jesus (cf. 2 Cor. 13:5).</p>
      <p> 28.   Just as a thought is made manifest through actions and words, so is our future reward through the impulses of the</p>
      <p> heart.</p>
      <p> 29.  Thus a merciful heart will receive mercy, while a merciless heart will receive the opposite.</p>
      <p> 30.  The law of freedom teaches the whole truth. Many read about it in a theoretical way, but few really understand</p>
      <p> it, and these only in the degree to which they practice the commandments.</p>
      <p> 31.  Do not seek the perfection of this law in human virtues, for it is not found perfect in them. Its perfection is hidden in the Cross of Christ.</p>
      <p> 32.  The law of freedom is studied by means of true knowledge, it is understood through the practice of the commandments, and is fulfilled through the mercy of Christ.</p>
      <p> 33.  When we are compelled by our conscience to accomplish all the commandments of God, then we shall understand that the law of the Lord is faultless (cf. Ps. 19:8. LXX). It is performed through our good actions, but cannot be perfected by men without God's mercy.</p>
      <p> 34.  Those who do not consider themselves under obligation to perform all Christ's commandments study the law of</p>
      <p> God in a literal manner, 'understanding neither what they say nor what they affirm' (1 Tim. 1:7). Therefore they think that they can fulfill it by their own works.</p>
      <p> 35.  There are acts which appear to be good, but the motive of the person who does them is not good; and there are</p>
      <p> other acts which appear to be bad, while the motive of the doer is good. The same is true of some statements. This discrepancy is due sometimes to</p>
      <p> [VI] 113</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic On the Spiritual Law Two Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> inexperience or ignorance, sometimes to evil intention, and sometimes to good intention.</p>
      <p> 36.  When a man outwardly praises someone, while accusing and disparaging him in his heart, it is hard for the simple to detect this. Similarly a person may be outwardly humble but inwardly arrogant. For a long time such men present falsehood as truth, but later they are exposed and condemned.</p>
      <p> 37.  One man does something apparently good, in defense of his neighbor; another, by not doing it, gains in understanding.</p>
      <p> 38.  Rebukes may be given in malice and self-defense, or out of fear of God and respect for truth.</p>
      <p> 39.  Cease rebuking a man who has stopped sinning and who has repented. If you say that you are rebuking him in God's name, first reveal the evils in yourself.</p>
      <p> 41.  When you have done something good, remember the words 'without Me you can do nothing' (John 15:5).</p>
      <p> 42.  Afflictions bring blessing to man; self-esteem and sensual pleasure, evil.</p>
      <p> 43.  He who suffers injustice escapes sin, finding help in proportion to his affliction.</p>
      <p> 44.  The greater a man's faith that Christ will reward him, the greater his readiness to endure every injustice.</p>
      <p> 45.  By praying for those who wrong us we overthrow the devil; opposing them we are wounded by him.</p>
      <p> 46.  Better a human than a demonic sin. Through performing the Lord's will we overcome both.</p>
      <p> 47.  Every blessing comes from the Lord providentially. But this fact escapes the notice of the ungrateful and the idle.</p>
      <p> 48.  Every vice leads in the end to forbidden pleasure; and every virtue to spiritual blessing. Each arouses what is</p>
      <p> akin to it.</p>
      <p> 49.  Censure from men afflicts the heart; but if patiently accepted it generates purity.</p>
      <p> 50.  Ignorance makes us reject what is beneficial; and when it becomes brazen it strengthens the hold of evil.</p>
      <p> 51.  Even when nothing is going wrong, be ready for affliction; and since you will have to give an account, do not make extortionate demands.</p>
      <p> 52.  Having sinned secretly, do not try to hide. For 'all things are</p>
      <p> [VI] 114</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic On the Spiritual Law Two Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we have to give an account' (Heb. 4:13).</p>
      <p> 53.  Reveal yourself to the Lord in your mind. 'For man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the</p>
      <p> heart' (i Sam. 16:7).</p>
      <p> 54.  Think nothing and do nothing without a purpose directed to God. For to journey without direction is wasted effort.</p>
      <p> 55.  Because God's justice is inexorable, it is hard to obtain forgiveness for sins committed with complete deliberation.</p>
      <p> 56.  Distress reminds the wise of God, but crushes those who forget Him.</p>
      <p> 57.  Let all involuntary suffering teach you to remember God, and you will not lack occasion for repentance.</p>
      <p> 58.  Forgetfulness as such has no power, but acquires it in proportion to our negligence.</p>
      <p> 59.  Do not say; 'What can 1 do? 1 don't want to be forgetful but it happens.' For when you did remember, you cheated over what you owed.</p>
      <p> blind forget-fuUness.</p>
      <p> 61.   Scripture says: 'Hell and perdition are manifest to the Lord' (Prov. 15:11. LXX). This refers to ignorance of heart</p>
      <p> and forgetful-ness.</p>
      <p> 62.  Hell is ignorance, for both are dark; and perdition is forgetfulness, for both involve extinction.</p>
      <p> 63.  Concern yourself with your own sins and not with those of your neighbor; then the workplace of your intellect will not be robbed.</p>
      <p> 64.  Failure to do the good that is within your power is hard to forgive. But mercy and prayer reclaim the negligent.</p>
      <p> 65.  To accept an affliction for God's sake is a genuine act of holiness; for true love is tested by adversities.</p>
      <p> 66.  Do not claim to have acquired virtue unless you have suffered affliction, for without affliction virtue has not been tested.</p>
      <p> 67.  Consider the outcome of every involuntary affliction, and you will find it has been the destruction of sin.</p>
      <p> 68.  Neighbors are very free with advice, but our own judgment is best.</p>
      <p> [VI] 115</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic On the Spiritual Law</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> 69.   If you want spiritual health, listen to your conscience, do all it tells you, and you will benefit.</p>
      <p> 70.  God and our conscience know our secrets. Let them correct us.</p>
      <p> 70a. He who toils unwillingly grows poor in every way, while he who presses ahead in hope is doubly rich.</p>
      <p> 71.   Man acts so far as he can in accordance with his own wishes; but God decides the outcome in accordance with justice.</p>
      <p> 72.  If you wish not to incur guilt when men praise you, first welcome reproof for your sins.</p>
      <p> 73.   Each time someone accepts humiliation for the sake of Christ's truth he will be glorified a hundredfold by other men. But it is better always to do good for the sake of blessings in the life to come.</p>
      <p> 74.   When one man helps another by word or deed, let them both recognize in this the grace of God. He who does not understand this will come under the power of him who does.</p>
      <p> 75.  Anyone who praises his neighbor out of hypocrisy will later abuse him and bring disgrace upon himself.</p>
      <p> 76.   He who is ignorant of the enemy's ambush is easily slain; and" he who does not know the causes of the passions is soon brought low.</p>
      <p> 77.  Knowledge of what is good for him has been given to everyone by God; but self-indulgence leads to</p>
      <p> negligence, and negligence to forgetfulness.</p>
      <p> 78.   A man advises his neighbor according to his own understanding; but in the one who listens to such advice, God acts in proportion to his faith.</p>
      <p> 79.  I have seen unlearned men who were truly humble, and they became wiser than the wise.</p>
      <p> 80.   Another unlearned man, upon hearing them praised, instead of imitating their humility, prided himself on being unlearned and so fell into arrogance.</p>
      <p> 81.   He who despises understanding and boasts of ignorance is unlearned not only in speech but also in knowledge (cf 2 Cor. 11:6).</p>
      <p> 82.   Just as wisdom in speech is one thing and sound judgment another, so lack of learning in speech is one thing and folly another.</p>
      <p> 83.  Ignorance of words will do no harm to the truly devout, nor will wisdom in speaking harm the humble.</p>
      <p> 84.  Do not say: 'I do not know what is right, therefore I am not</p>
      <p> [VI] 116</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic On the Spiritual Law</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> to blame when I fail to do it.' For if you did all the good about which you do know, what you should do next would then become clear to you, as if you were passing through a house from one room to another. It is not helpful to know what comes later before you have done what comes first. For knowledge without action 'puffs up', but 'love edifies', because it 'patiently accepts all things' (1 Cor. 8:1; 13:7).</p>
      <p> 85.  Understand the words of Holy Scripture by putting them into practice, and do not fill yourself with conceit by</p>
      <p> expatiating on theoretical ideas.</p>
      <p> 86.  He who neglects action and depends on theoretical knowledge holds a staff of reed instead of a double-edged</p>
      <p> sword; and when he confronts his enemies in time of war, 'it will go into his hand, and pierce it' (2 Kgs. 18:21), injecting its natural poison.</p>
      <p> 87.  Every thought has its weight and measure in God's sight. For it is possible to think about the same thing either</p>
      <p> passionately or objectively.</p>
      <p> 88.  After fulfilling a commandment expect to be tempted: for love of Christ is tested by adversity.</p>
      <p> 89.  Never belittle the significance of your thoughts, for not one escapes God's notice.</p>
      <p> 90.  When you observe some thought suggesting that you seek human fame, you can be sure it will bring you disgrace.</p>
      <p> 91.  The enemy, understanding how the justice of the spiritual law is applied, seeks only the assent of our mind. Having secured this, he will either oblige us to undergo' the labors of repentance or, if we do not repent, will torment us with misfortunes beyond our control. Sometimes he encourages us to resist these misfortunes so as</p>
      <p> to increase our torment, and then, at our death, he wiU point to this impatient resistance as proof of our lack of faith.</p>
      <p> 92.  Many have fought in various ways against circumstances; but without prayer and repentance no one has escaped</p>
      <p> evil.</p>
      <p> 93.  Evils reinforce each other; so do virtues, thus encouraging us to still greater efforts.</p>
      <p> 94.  The devil belittles small sins; otherwise he cannot lead us into greater ones.</p>
      <p> 95.  Praise from others engenders sinful desire, while their condemnation of vice, if not only heard but accepted, engenders self-restraint.</p>
      <p> [VI] 117</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic On the Spiritual Law</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> 96.  A self-indulgent monk has achieved nothing through his renunciation. For what he once did through possessions</p>
      <p> he still does though possessing nothing.</p>
      <p> 97.   Moreover, the self-controlled man, if he clings to possessions, is a brother in spirit of this kind of monk; because</p>
      <p> they both feel inward enjoyment they have the same mother - though not the same father, since each has a different passion.</p>
      <p> 98.   Sometimes a man cuts off a passion in order to indulge himself more fully, and he is praised by those unaware of</p>
      <p> his aim. He may even be unaware of it himself, and so his action is self-defeating.</p>
      <p> 99.  All vice is caused by self-esteem and sensual pleasure; you cannot overcome passion without hating them.</p>
      <p> 100.  Avarice is the root of all evil' (1 Tim. 6:10); but avarice is clearly a product of these two components.</p>
      <p> 101.  The intellect is made blind by these three passions: avarice, self-esteem and sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> 102.  Scripture calls these three the daughters of the horseleech, dearly loved by their mother folly (cf. Prov. 30:15. LXX).</p>
      <p> 103.  These three passions on their own dull spiritual knowledge and faith, the foster-brothers of our nature.</p>
      <p> 104.  It is because of them that wrath, anger, war, murder and all other evils have such power over mankind.</p>
      <p> 105.  We must hate avarice, self-esteem and sensual pleasure, as mothers of the vices and stepmothers of the virtues.</p>
      <p> 106.  Because of them we are commanded not to love 'the world' and 'the things that are in the world' (1 John 2:15j; not so that we should hate God's creation through lack of discernment, but so that we should eliminate the occasions for these three passions.</p>
      <p> 107.  'The soldier going to war', it is said, 'does not entangle himself in the affairs of this world' (2 Tim. 2:4). For he who entangles himself with the passions while trying to overcome them is like a man who tries to put out a fire with straw.</p>
      <p> 108.  If one becomes angry with one's neighbor on account of riches, fame or pleasure, one does not yet realize that God orders all things with justice.</p>
      <p> 109.  When you hear the Lord saying that if someone does not renounce all that he has he 'is not worthy of Me' (Matt. 10:37), apply this not only to money but to all forms of vice.</p>

      <p> 110.  He who does not know the truth cannot truly have faith; for by nature knowledge precedes faith.</p>
      <p> 111.  Just as God assigns to everything visible what is appropriate, so He does also to human thoughts, whether we wish it or not.</p>
      <p> 112.  If some obvious sinner who does not repent has suffered nothing before his death, you may be sure that judgment in his case will be merciless.</p>
      <p> 113.  He who prays with understanding patiently accepts circumstances, whereas he who resents them has not yet attained pure prayer.</p>
      <p> 114.  When harmed, insulted or persecuted by someone, do not think of the present but wait for the future, and you will find he has brought you much good, not only in this life but also in the life to come.</p>
      <p> 115.  Just as the bitterness of absinth helps a poor appetite, so misfortunes help a bad character. For the first benefits the physical condition, and the second leads to repentance.</p>
      <p> 116.  If you do not want to suffer evil, do not inflict it, since the suffering of it inevitably follows its infliction. 'For whatever a man sows he will also reap' (Gal.  6:1).</p>
      <p> 117.  Reaping unwillingly the wickedness we deliberately sow, we should marvel at God's justice.</p>
      <p> 118.  Because an interval of time elapses between sowing and reaping, we begin to think there will be no requital.</p>
      <p> 119.  When you sin, blame your thought, not your action. For had your intellect not run ahead, your body would not have followed.</p>
      <p> 120.  The secret sinner is worse than those who do evil openly; and so he receives a worse punishment.</p>
      <p> 121.   The trickster who works mischief in secret is a snake 'lying in wait on the road and biting the horse's heel' (Gen. 49:17. LXX).</p>
      <p> 122.  If you praise your neighbor to one man and criticize him to another, you are the slave of self-esteem and jealousy. Through praise you try to hide your jealousy, through criticism to appear better than your neighbor.</p>
      <p> 124. He who secretly mingles his own wishes with spiritual counsel is an adulterer, as the Book of Proverbs indicates (cf. Prov. 6:32-33); and because of his stupidity he suffers pain and dishonor.</p>
      <p> 110.  He who does not know the tmth cannot truly have faith: for by nature knowledge precedes faith.</p>
      <p> 111.  Just as God assigns to everything visible what is appropriate, so He does also to human thoughts, whether we wish it or not.</p>
      <p> 112.  If some obvious sinner who does not repent has suffered nothing before his death, you may be sure that judgment in his case will be merciless.</p>

      <p> 123.  Just as sheep and wolves cannot feed together, so a man cannot receive mercy if he tricks his neighbor.</p>
      <p> 124.  He who secretly mingles his own wishes with spiritual counsel is an adulterer, as the Book of Proverbs indicates (cf Prov. 6:32-33); and because of his stupidity he suffers pain and dishonor.</p>
      <p> [VI] 119</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On the Spiritual Law Two Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> 126.  He who seeks forgiveness of his sins loves humility, but if he condemns another he seals his own wickedness.</p>
      <p> 127.  Do not leave unobliterated any fault, however small, for it may lead you on to greater sins.</p>
      <p> 128.  If you wish to be saved, welcome words of truth, and never reject criticism uncritically.</p>
      <p> 129.  Words of truth converted the 'progeny of vipers' and warned them 'to flee from the anger to come' (Matt. 3:7).</p>
      <p> 130.  To accept words of truth is to accept the divine Word; for He says: 'He that receives you receives me' (Matt. 10:40).</p>
      <p> 131.  The paralytic let down through the roof (cf Mark 2:4) signifies a sinner reproved in God's name by the faithful and receiving forgiveness because of their faith.</p>
      <p> 132.  It is better' to pray devoutly for your neighbor than to rebuke him every time he sins.</p>
      <p> 133.  The truly repentant is derided by the foolish - which is a sign that God has accepted his repentance.</p>
      <p> 134.  Those engaged in spiritual warfare practice self-control in everything, and do not desist until the Lord destroys all 'seed from Babylon' (Jer. 27:16. LXX).</p>
      <p> 135.  Suppose that there are twelve shameful passions. Indulging in any one of them is equivalent to indulging in them all.</p>
      <p> 136.  Sin is a blazing fire. The less fuel you give it, the faster it dies down: the more you feed it, the more it bums.</p>
      <p> 137.   When elated by praise, be sure disgrace will follow; for it is said: 'Whoever exalts himself will be abased' (Luke 14:11).</p>
      <p> 138.  When we have freed ourselves from every voluntary sin of the mind, we should then fight against the passions which result from prepossession.</p>
      <p> 139.   Prepossession is the involuntary presence of former sins in the memory. At the stage of active warfare we try to prevent it from developing into a passion; after victory it is repulsed while still but a provocation.</p>
      <p> 140.   A provocation is an image-free stimulation in the heart. Like a mountain-pass, the experienced take control of it ahead of the enemy.</p>
      <p> 141.   Once our thoughts are accompanied by images we have [VI] 120</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic On the Spiritual Law</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> already given them our assent; for a provocation does not involve us in guilt so long as it is not accompanied by</p>
      <p> images. Some people flee away from these thoughts like 'a brand plucked out of the fire' (Zech. 3:2); but others dally with them, and so get burnt.</p>
      <p> 142.   Do not say: 'I don't want it, but it happens.' For even though you may not want the thing itself, yet you welcome what causes it.</p>
      <p> 143.  He who seeks praise is involved in passion; he who laments afflictions is attached to sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> 144.  The thoughts of a self-indulgent man vacillate, as though on scales; sometimes he laments and weeps for his sins, and sometimes he fights and contradicts his neighbor, justifying his own sensual pleasures.</p>
      <p> 145.  He who tests all things and 'holds fast that which is good' (1 Thess.  5:21)  will in consequence refrain from all evil.</p>
      <p> 146.  'A patient man abounds in understanding' (Prov. 14: 29); and so does he who listens to words of wisdom.</p>
      <p> 147.   Without remembrance of God, there can be no true knowledge but only that which is false.</p>
      <p> 148.   Deeper spiritual knowledge helps the hard-hearted man: for unless he has fear, he refuses to accept the labor of repentance.</p>
      <p> 149.   Unquestioning acceptance of tradition is helpful for a gentle person, for then he will not try God's patience or often fall into sin.</p>
      <p> 150.   Do not rebuke a forceful man for arrogance, but point out to him the danger of dishonor; if he has any sense he will accept this kind of rebuke.</p>
      <p> 151.   If you hate rebuke, it shows that the passion in which you are involved is due to your own free choice. But if you welcome rebuke, the passion is due to prepossession.</p>
      <p> 152.   Do not listen to talk about other people's sins. For through such listening the form of these sins is imprinted on you.</p>
      <p> 153.   When you delight in hearing evil talk, be angry with yourself and not with the speaker. For listening in a sinful way makes the messenger seem sinful.</p>
      <p> 154.   If you come across people gossiping idly, consider yourself responsible for their talk - if not on account of some recent fault of your own, then because of an old debt.</p>
      <p> [VI] 121</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic On the Spiritual Law</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> 155.  If someone praises you hypocritically, be sure that in due course he will vilify you.</p>
      <p> 156.  Accept present afflictions for the sake of future blessings; then you will never weaken in your struggle.</p>
      <p> later seem to you to be evil.</p>
      <p> 158.  All good things come from God providentially, and those who bring them are the servants of what is good.</p>
      <p> 159.  Accept with equanimity the intermingling of good and evil, and then God will resolve all inequity.</p>
      <p> 160.   It is the uneven quality of our thoughts that produces changes m our condition. For God assigns to our voluntary thoughts consequences which are appropriate but not necessarily of our choice.</p>
      <p> 161.  The sensible derives from the intelligible, by God's decree providing what is needed.</p>
      <p> 162.   From a pleasure-loving heart arise unhealthy thoughts and words; and from the smoke of a fire we recognize the fuel.</p>
      <p> 163.   Guard your mind, and you will not be harassed by temptations. But if you fail to guard it, accept patiently whatever trial comes.</p>
      <p> 164.  Pray that temptation may not come to you; but when it comes, accept it as your due and not undeserved.</p>
      <p> 165.  Reject all thoughts of greed, and you will be able to see the devil's tricks.</p>
      <p> 166.  He who says he knows all the devil's tricks falls unknowingly into his trap.</p>
      <p> 167.  The more the intellect withdraws from bodily cares, the more clearly it sees the craftiness of the enemy.</p>
      <p> 168.   A man who is carried away by his thoughts is blinded by them; and while he can see the actual working of sin, he cannot see its causes.</p>
      <p> 169.   It can happen that someone may in appearance be fulfilling a commandment but is in reality serving a passion, and through evil thoughts he destroys the goodness of the action.</p>
      <p> 170.   When you first become involved in something evil, don't say: 'It will not overpower me.' For to the extent that you are involved you have already been overpowered by it.</p>
      <p> [VI] 122</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic On the Spiritual Law</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> 171.  Everything that happens has a small beginning, and grows the more it is nourished.</p>
      <p> 172.  Wickedness is an intricate net; and if someone is careless when partially entangled, he gets completely enmeshed.</p>
      <p> 173.  Do not desire to hear about the misfortunes of your enemies. For those who like listening to such things will themselves suffer what they wish for others.</p>
      <p> tested. Thus it is written that the ungodly and wicked shall be persecuted (cf. Ps. 37: 28), but also that those who 'seek to live a holy life in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution' (2 Tim. 3:12).</p>
      <p> 175.   At a time of affliction, expect a provocation to sensual pleasure, for because it relieves the affliction it is readily welcomed.</p>
      <p> 176.  Some call men intelligent because they have the power of discernment on the sensible plane. But the really intelligent people are those who control their own desires.</p>
      <p> 177.  Until you have eradicated evil, do not obey your heart; for it will seek more of what it already contains within itself</p>
      <p> 178.  Just as some snakes live in glens and others in houses, so there are some passions which take shape in our thoughts while others express themselves in action. It is possible, however, for them to change from one type to the other.</p>
      <p> 179.  When you find that some thought is disturbing you deeply in yourself and is breaking the stillness of your intellect with passion, you may be sure that it was your intellect which, taking the initiative, first activated this thought and placed it in your heart.</p>
      <p> 180.  No cloud is formed without a breath of wind: and no passion is bom without a thought.</p>
      <p> 181.  If we no longer fulfill the desires of the flesh, then with the Lord's help the evils within us will easily be eliminated.</p>
      <p> 182.  Images already established in our intellect are more pernicious and stubborn than those which arise while we are thmking. The latter precede the former and are their cause.</p>
      <p> 183.  One kind of evil dwells in the heart through long-contmued prepossession; another kind attacks our thoughts through the medium of everyday things.</p>
      <p> 184.   God assesses our action according to our intention; for it is [VI] 123</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic On the Spiritual Law</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> said that the Lord will 'reward you according to your heart" (Ps. 20:4).</p>
      <p> 185.  He who does not persevere in examining his conscience will not endure bodily suffering for God's sake.</p>
      <p> 186.  The conscience is nature's book. He who applies what he reads there experiences God's help.</p>
      <p> 187.  He who does not choose to suffer for the sake of truth will be chastened more painfully by suffering he has not chosen.</p>
      <p> 188.   He who knows God's will, and performs it according to his power, escapes more severe suffering by suffering a little.</p>
      <p> 189.   If a man tries to overcome temptations without prayer and patient endurance, he wiU become more entangled in them instead of driving them away.</p>
      <p> 190.  The Lord is hidden in His own commandments, and He is to be found there in the measure that He is sought.</p>
      <p> 191.  Do not say: 'I have fulfilled the commandments, but have not found the Lord'. For you have often found 'spiritual knowledge with righteousness', as Scripture says, 'and those who rightly seek Him shall find peace' (Prov. 16:8. LXX).</p>
      <p> 192.  Peace is deliverance from the passions, and is not found except through the action of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> 193.  Fulfilling a commandment is one thing, and virtue is another, although each promotes the other.</p>
      <p> 194.  Fulfilling a commandment means doing what we are enjoined to do; but virtue is to do it in a manner that conforms to the trath.</p>
      <p> 195.  All material wealth is the same, but is acquired in many different ways; similarly, virtue is one, but is many-sided in its operations.</p>
      <p> 196.  If someone makes a display of wisdom and instead of applying it talks at length, he has a spurious wealth and his labors 'come into the houses of strangers' (Prov. 5:10. LXX).</p>
      <p> 197.  It is said that gold rules everything; but spiritual things are ruled by the grace of God.</p>
      <p> 198.  A good conscience is found through prayer, and pure prayer through the conscience. Each by nature needs the other.</p>
      <p> 199.  Jacob made for Joseph a coat of many colors (cf Gen. 37:3), and the Lord gives knowledge of truth to the gentle; as</p>
      <p> [VI] 124</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic On the Spiritual Law</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> it is written, 'He will teach the gentle His ways' (Ps. 25:9. LXX).</p>
      <p> 200.  Always do as much good as you can, and at a time of greater good do not turn to a lesser. For it is said that no man who turns back 'is fit for the kingdom of heaven' (cf. Luke 9:62).</p>
      <p> [VI] 125</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty- Six Texts</p>
      <p> 1.  In the texts which follow, the beliefs of those in error will be refuted by those whose faith is well founded and who know the truth.</p>
      <p> 2.  Wishing to show that to fulfill every commandment is a duty, whereas sonship is a gift given to men through His</p>
      <p> own Blood, the Lord said: 'When you have done all that is commanded you, say: "We are useless servants: we have only done what was our duty" ' (Luke 17:10). Thus the kingdom of heaven is not a reward for works, but a gift of grace prepared by the Master for his faithful servants</p>
      <p> 3.  A slave does not demand his freedom as a reward: but he gives satisfaction as one who is in debt, and he receives</p>
      <p> freedom as a gift.</p>
      <p> 4.  'Christ died on account of our sins in accordance with the Scriptures' (1 Cor. 15:3); and to those who serve Him</p>
      <p> well He gives freedom. 'Well done, good and faithful servant,' He says, 'you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter into the joy of your Lord' (Matt. 25:21).</p>
      <p> 5.  He who relies on theoretical knowledge alone is not yet a faithful servant: a faithful servant is one who expresses</p>
      <p> his faith in Christ through obedience to His commandments.</p>
      <p> 6.   He who honors the Lord does what the Lord bids. When he sins or is disobedient, he patiently accepts what comes</p>
      <p> as something he deserves.</p>
      <p> 7.  If you love true knowledge, devote yourself to the ascetic life; for mere theoretical knowledge puffs a man up (cf.</p>
      <p> 1 Cor. 8:1).</p>
      <p> 8.   Unexpected trials are sent by God to teach us to practice the [VI] 126</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> ascetic life; and they lead us to repentance even when we are reluctant.</p>
      <p> 9.   Afflictions that come to us are the result of our own sins. But if we accept them patiently through prayer, we shall</p>
      <p> again find blessings,</p>
      <p> 10.  Some people when praised for their virtue are delighted, and attribute this pleasurable feeling of self-esteem to grace. Others when reproved for their sins are pained, and they mistake this beneficial pain for the action of sin.</p>
      <p> 11.  Those who, because of the rigor of their own ascetic practice, despise the less zealous, think that they are made righteous by physical works. But we are even more foolish if we rely on theoretical knowledge and disparage the ignorant.</p>
      <p> 12.  Even though knowledge is true, it is still not firmly established if unaccompanied by works. For everything is</p>
      <p> established by being put into practice.</p>
      <p> 13.  Often our knowledge becomes darkened because we fail to put things into practice. For when we have totally neglected to practice something, our memory of it will gradually disappear.</p>
      <p> 14.  For this reason Scripture urges us to acquire the knowledge of God, so that through our works we may serve Him rightly.</p>
      <p> 15.  When we fulfill the commandments in our outward actions, we receive from the Lord what is appropriate; but</p>
      <p> any real benefit we gain depends on our inward intention.</p>
      <p> is true whether the intended action is good or bad.</p>
      <p> 17.   The intellect does many good and bad things without the body, whereas the body can do neither good nor evil without the intellect. This is because the law of freedom applies to what happens before we act.</p>
      <p> 18.  Some without fulfilling the commandments think that they possess true faith. Others fulfill the commandments and then expect the kingdom as a reward due to them. Both are mistaken.</p>
      <p> 19.  A master is under no obligation to reward his slaves; on the other hand, those who do not serve him well are not</p>
      <p> given their freedom.</p>
      <p> 20.   If 'Christ died on our account in accordance with the Scriptures' (Rom. 5: 8; 1 Cor. 15:3), and we do not 'live for [VI] 127</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> ourselves', but 'for Him who died and rose' on our account (2 Cor. 5:15), it is clear that we are debtors to Christ to serve Him till our death. How then can we regard sonship as something which is our due?</p>
      <p> 21.  Christ is Master by virtue of His own essence and Master by virtue of His incarnate life. For He creates man from nothing, and through His own Blood redeems him when dead in sin: and to those who believe in Him He has given His grace.</p>
      <p> 22.  When Scripture says 'He will reward every man according to his works' (Matt. 16: 27), do not imagine that works in themselves merit either hell or the kingdom. On the contrary, Christ rewards each man according to whether his works are done with faith or without faith in Himself; and He is not a dealer bound by contract, but God our Creator and Redeemer.</p>
      <p> 23.  We who have received baptism offer good works, not by way of repayment, but to preserve the purity given to</p>
      <p> 24.   Every good work which we perform through our own natural powers causes us to refrain from the corresponding</p>
      <p> sin: but without grace it cannot contribute to our sanctification.</p>
      <p> 25.  The self-controlled refrain from gluttony; those who have renounced possessions, from greed; the tranquil, from</p>
      <p> loquacity; the pure, from self-indulgence; the modest, from unchastity: the self-dependent, from avarice: the gentle, from agitation; the humble, from self-esteem; the obedient, from quarrelling; the self-critical, from hypocrisy. Similarly, those who pray are protected from despair: the poor, from having many possessions: confessors of the faith, from its denial: martyrs, from idolatry. Do you see how every virtue that is performed even to the point of death is nothing other than refraining from sin? Now to refrain from sin is a work within our own natural powers, but not something that buys us the kingdom.</p>
      <p> 26.   While man can scarcely keep what belongs to him by nature, Christ gives the grace of sonship through the Cross.</p>
      <p> 27.  Certain commandments are specific, and others are comprehensive. Thus Christ enjoins us specifically to 'share with him who has none' (Luke 3:11); and He gives us a comprehensive command to forsake all that we have (cf. Luke 14:33).</p>
      <p> 28. There is an energy of grace not understood by beginners, and there is also an energy of evil which resembles the truth. It is</p>
      <p> [VI] 128</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> advisable not to scrutinize these energies too closely, because one may be led astray, and not to condemn them out of hand, because they may contain some truth, but we should lay everything before God in hope, for He knows what is of value in both of them.</p>
      <p> 29.  He who wants to cross the spiritual sea is long-suffering, humble, vigilant and self-controlled. If he impetuously</p>
      <p> embarks on it without these four virtues, he agitates his heart, but cannot cross.</p>
      <p> 30.  Stillness helps us by making evil inoperative.' If it also takes to itself these four virtues in prayer, it is the most direct support in attaining dispassion.</p>
      <p> 31.  The intellect cannot be still unless the body is still also: and the wall between them cannot be demolished without stillness and prayer.</p>
      <p> 32.  The flesh with its desire is opposed to the spirit, and the spirit opposed to the flesh, and those who live in the</p>
      <p> spirit will not carry out the desire of the flesh (cf Gal. 5:15-17).</p>
      <p> 33.   There is no perfect prayer unless the intellect invokes God: and when our thought cries aloud without distraction,</p>
      <p> the Lord will listen.</p>
      <p> 34.  When the intellect prays without distraction it afflicts the heart: and 'a broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou</p>
      <p> wilt not despise' (Ps. 51:17).</p>
      <p> 35.   Prayer is called a virtue, but in reality it is the mother of the virtues: for it gives birth to them through union with</p>
      <p> Christ.</p>
      <p> 36.  Whatever we do without prayer and without hope in God turns out afterwards to be harmful and defective.</p>
      <p> 37.  Christ's words that the 'first will be last, and the last will be first' (Matt. 19:30) refer to those who participate in the virtues and those who participate in love. For love is the last of the virtues to be bom in the heart, but it is the first in value, so that those bom before it turn out to be 'the last".</p>
      <p> 38.  If you are listless when you pray or afflicted by various forms of evil, call to mind your death and the torments</p>
      <p> of hell. But it is better to cleave to God through hope and prayer than to think about external things, even though such thoughts may be helpful.</p>
      <p> 39.  No single virtue by itself opens the door of our nature: but all the virtues must be linked together in the correct</p>
      <p> sequence.</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> 40. He whose mind teems with thoughts lacks seh'-control; and even when they are beneficial, hope is more so.</p>
      <p> 41.  There is a sin which is always 'unto death' (1 John 5:16): the sin for which we do not repent. For this sin even a</p>
      <p> saint's prayers will not be heard.</p>
      <p> 42.  He who repents rightly does not imagine that it is his own effort which cancels his former sins; but through this</p>
      <p> effort he makes his peace with God.</p>
      <p> 43.  If we are under an obligation to perform daily all the good actions of which our nature is capable, what do we have left over to give to God in repayment for our past sins?</p>
      <p> 44.  However great our virtuous actions of today, they do not requite but condemn our past negligence.</p>
      <p> 45.   He who suffers affliction in his intellect but relaxes physically is like one who suffers affliction in his body while</p>
      <p> allowing his intellect to be dispersed.</p>
      <p> 46.  Voluntary affliction in one of these parts of our nature benefits the other: to suffer affliction with the mind benefits the flesh, and to suffer it with the flesh benefits the mind. When our mind and flesh are not in union,^ our state deteriorates.</p>
      <p> 47.   It is a great virtue to accept patiently whatever comes and, as the Lord enjoins, to love a neighbor who hates you.</p>
      <p> 48.  The sign of sincere love is to forgive wrongs done to us. It was with such love that the Lord loved the world.</p>
      <p> 49.  We cannot with all our heart forgive someone who does us wrong unless we possess real knowledge. For this</p>
      <p> knowledge shows us that we deserve all we experience.</p>
      <p> 50.  You will lose nothing of what you have renounced for the Lord's sake. For in its own time it will return to you</p>
      <p> greatly multiplied.</p>
      <p> 51.  When the intellect forgets the purpose of true devotion, then external works of virtue bring no profit.</p>
      <p> 52.  If poor judgment is harmful to everyone, it is particularly so to those who live with great strictness.</p>
      <p> 53.  Philosophize through your works about man's will and God's retribution. For your words are only as wise and as</p>
      <p> profitable as your works.</p>
      <p> 54.   Those who suffer for the sake of true devotion receive help. [VI] 130</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> This must be learnt through obeying God's law and our own conscience.</p>
      <p> 55.   One man received a thought and accepted it without examination. Another received a thought and tested its truth.</p>
      <p> Which of them acted with greater reverence?</p>
      <p> 56.  Real knowledge is patiently to accept affliction and not to blame others for our own misfortunes.</p>
      <p> 57.  He who does something good and expects a reward is serving not God but his own will.</p>
      <p> 58.  A sinner cannot escape retribution except through repentance appropriate to his offence.</p>
      <p> 59.  There are those who claim that we cannot do good unless we actively receive the grace of the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 60.  Those who always by choice incline to sensual pleasures refrain from doing what lies within their power on the</p>
      <p> grounds that they lack-help.</p>
      <p> 61.  Grace has been given mystically to those who have been baptized into Christ: and it becomes active within them</p>
      <p> to the extent that they actively observe the commandments. Grace never ceases to help us secretly: but to do good- as far as lies in our power -depends on us.</p>
      <p> 62.   Initially grace arouses the conscience in a divine manner. That is how even sinners have come to repent and so to</p>
      <p> conform to God's will.</p>
      <p> 63.  Again, grace may be hidden in advice given by a neighbor. Sometimes it also accompanies our understanding</p>
      <p> during reading, and as a natural result teaches our intellect the truth about itself. If, then, we do not hide the talent given to us in this way, we shall enter actively into the joy of the Lord.</p>
      <p> 64.  He who seeks the energies of the Spirit, before he has actively observed the commandments, is like someone who sells himself into slavery and who, as soon as he is bought, asks to be given his freedom while still keeping his purchase-money.</p>
      <p> 61. When you have found that external events come to you through God's justice, then in your search for the Lord you have found 'spiritual knowledge and justice' (cf. Prov. 16:8. LXX).</p>
      <p> 66.   Once you recognize that the Lord's judgments 'are in all the earth' (1 Chr. 16:14), then everything that happens to</p>
      <p> you will teach you knowledge of God.</p>
      <p> [VI] 131</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> 67.  Everyone receives what he deserves in accordance with his inner state. But only God understands the many</p>
      <p> different ways in which this happens.</p>
      <p> will not be saddened or upset by the dishonor; and when you receive the glory you will remain steadfast and innocent.</p>
      <p> 69.  When God allows you to be praised, do not become boastful on account of this divine providence, lest you then</p>
      <p> fall into dishonor.</p>
      <p> 70.   A seed will not grow without earth and water; and a man will not develop without voluntary suffering and divine</p>
      <p> help.</p>
      <p> 71.  Rain cannot fall without a cloud, and we cannot please God without a good conscience.</p>
      <p> 72.   Do not refuse to learn, even though you may be very intelligent. For what God provides has more value than our</p>
      <p> own intelligence.</p>
      <p> 73.  When through some sensual pleasure the heart is deflected from the ascetic way, it becomes difficult to control,</p>
      <p> like a heavy stone dislodged on steep ground.</p>
      <p> 74.  Like a young calf which, in its search for grazing, finds itself on a ledge surrounded by precipices, the soul is</p>
      <p> gradually led astray by its thoughts.</p>
      <p> 75.  When the intellect, having grown to full maturity in the Lord, wrenches the soul from long-continued</p>
      <p> prepossession, the heart suffers torments as if on the rack, since intellect and passion drag it in opposite directions.</p>
      <p> 76.  Just as sailors, in the hope of gain, gladly endure the burning heat of the sun, so those who hate wickedness</p>
      <p> gladly accept reproof. For the former contend with the winds, the latter with passions.</p>
      <p> 77.  Just as flight in winter or on the Sabbath day (cf Matt. 24: 2o) brings suffering to the flesh and defilement to the</p>
      <p> soul, so too does resurgence of the passions in an aged body and a consecrated soul.</p>
      <p> 78.  No one is as good and merciful as the Lord. But even He does not forgive the unrepentant.</p>
      <p> 79.  Many of us feel remorse for our sins, yet we gladly accept their causes.</p>
      <p> 80.  A mole burrowing in the earth is blind and cannot see the stars; and he who does not trust God in temporal</p>
      <p> things will not trust Him in eternal things.</p>
      <p> [VI] 132</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> 81.  Real knowledge has been given to men by God as a grace preceding the fullness of grace; it teaches those who</p>
      <p> partake of it to believe above all in the Giver.</p>
      <p> 82.  When a sinful soul does not accept the afflictions that come to it, the angels say: 'We would have healed Babylon, but she was not healed' (Jer. 51:9)</p>
      <p> 83.  When an intellect forgets real knowledge, it fights with men for harmful things as though they were helpful.</p>
      <p> 84.  Fire cannot last long in water, nor can a shameful thought in a heart that loves God. For every man who loves</p>
      <p> God suffers gladly, and voluntary suffering is by nature the enemy of sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> against our wiU.</p>
      <p> 86.  We have a love for the causes of involuntary thoughts, and that is why they come. In the case of voluntary thoughts we clearly have a love not only for the causes but also for the objects with which they are concerned.</p>
      <p> 87.  Presumption and boastfulness are causes of blasphemy. Avarice and self-esteem are causes of cruelty and hypocrisy.</p>
      <p> 88.  When the devil sees that our intellect has prayed from the heart, he makes a powerful attack with subtle temptations; but he does not bother to destroy the lesser virtues by such powerful attacks.</p>
      <p> 89.  When a thought lingers within a man, this indicates his attachment to it; but when it is quickly destroyed, this</p>
      <p> signifies his opposition and hostility to it.</p>
      <p> 90.  The intellect changes from one to another of three different noetic states; that according to nature, above nature,</p>
      <p> and contrary to nature. When it enters the state according to nature, it finds that it is itself the cause of evil thoughts, and confesses its sins to God, clearly understanding the causes of the passions. When it is in the state contrary to nature, it forgets God's justice and fights with men, believing itself unjustly treated. But when it is raised to the state above nature, it finds the fruits of the Holy Spirit: love, joy, peace and the other fruits of which the Apostle speaks (cf. Gal. 5:22); and it knows that if it gives priority to bodily cares it cannot remain in this state. An intellect that departs from this state falls into sin and all the terrible consequences of sin - if not immediately, then in due time, as God's justice shall decide.</p>
      <p> [VI] 133</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> 91.  Each man's knowledge is genuine to the extent that it is confirmed by gentleness, humility and love.</p>
      <p> 92.  Everyone baptized in the orthodox manner has received mystically the fullness of grace; but he becomes conscious of this grace only to the extent that he actively observes the commandments.</p>
      <p> 93.  If we fulfill Christ's commandments according to our conscience, we are spiritually refreshed to the extent that we suffer in our heart. But each thing comes to us at the right time.</p>
      <p> 94.  Pray persistently about everything, and then you will never do anything without God's help.</p>
      <p> 95.  Nothing is stronger than prayer in its action, nothing more effective in winning God's favor.</p>
      <p> 96.  Prayer comprises the complete fulfillment of the commandments; for there is nothing higher than love for God.</p>
      <p> 97.  Undistracted prayer is a sign of love for God; but careless or distracted prayer is a sign of love for pleasure.</p>
      <p> 98.  He who can without strain keep vigil, be long-suffering and pray is manifestly a partaker of the Holy Spirit. But</p>
      <p> he who feels strain while doing these things, yet willingly endures it, also quickly receives help.</p>
      <p> 99.  One commandment is higher than another; consequently one level of faith is more firmly founded than another.</p>
      <p> 100.  There is faith 'that comes by hearing' (Rom. 10:17) and there is faith that 'is the substance of things hoped for' (Heb. 11:1).</p>
      <p> 101.  It is good to help enquirers with words; but it is better to co-operate with them through prayer and the practice of virtue. For he who through these offers himself to God, helps his neighbor through helping himself.</p>
      <p> 102.  If you want with a few words to benefit one who is eager to learn, speak to him about prayer, right faith, and the patient acceptance of what comes. For all else that is good is found through these.</p>
      <p> 103.  Once we have entrusted our hope about something to God, we no longer quarrel with our neighbor over it.</p>
      <p> 104.  If, as Scripture teaches, everything involuntary has its cause in what is voluntary, man has no greater enemy than himself</p>
      <p> 105.   The first among all evils is ignorance; next comes lack of faith.</p>
      <p> 106.  Escape from temptation through patience and prayer. If</p>
      <p> [VI] 134</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> you oppose temptation without these, it only attacks you more strongly.</p>
      <p> 107.  He who is gentle in God's sight is wiser than the wise; and he who is humble in heart is stronger than the strong. For they bear the yoke of Christ with spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 108.  Everything we say or do without prayer afterwards turns out to be unreliable or harmful, and so shows us up without our realizing it.</p>
      <p> 109.  One alone is righteous in works, words and thoughts. But many are made righteous in faith, grace and repentance.</p>
      <p> 110.  One who is repentant cannot be haughty, just as one who sins deliberately cannot be humble-minded.</p>
      <p> 111.  Humility consists, not in condemning our conscience, but in recognizing God's grace and compassion.</p>
      <p> 112.   What a house is to the air, the spiritual intellect is to divine grace. The more you get rid of materiality, the more the air and grace will come in of their own accord; and the more you increase materiality, the more they will go away.</p>
      <p> 113.   Materiality in the case of a house consists of furnishings and food. Materiality in the case of the intellect is self-esteem and sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> 114.  Ample room in the heart denotes hope in God; congestion denotes bodily care.</p>
      <p> 115.  The grace of the Spirit is one and unchanging, but energizes in each one of us as He wills (cf 1 Cor. 12:11).</p>
      <p> 116.  When rain falls upon the earth, it gives life to the quality inherent in each plant: sweetness in the sweet, astringency in the astringent; similarly, when grace falls upon the hearts of the faithful, it gives to each the energies appropriate to the different virtues without itself changing.</p>
      <p> 117.  To him who hungers after Christ grace is food; to him who is thirsty, a reviving drink; to him who is cold, a garment; to him who is weary, rest; to him who prays, assurance; to him who mourns, consolation.</p>
      <p> 118.  When you hear Scripture saying of the Holy Spirit that He 'rested upon each' of the Apostles (Acts 2:3), or 'came upon' the Prophet (1 Sam. 11:6), or 'energizes' (1 Cor. 12:11), or is 'grieved' (Eph. 4:30), or is 'quenched'</p>
      <p> (1 Thess. 5:19), oris [VI] 135</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> 'vexed (Isa. 63:10), and again, that some 'have the first fruits' (Rom. 8:23), and that others are 'filled with the Holy Spirit' (Acts 2:4), do not suppose that the Spirit is subject to some kind of division, variation or change: but be sure that, in the way we have described. He is unvarying, unchanging and all-powerful. Therefore in all His energies He remains what He is, and in a divine manner He gives to each person what is needful. On those who have been baptized He pours Himself out in His fullness like the sun. Each of us is illumined by Him to the extent to which we hate the passions that darken us and get rid of them. But in so far as we have a love for them and dwell on them, we remain in darkness.</p>
      <p> 119.  He who hates the passions gets rid of their causes. But he who is attracted by their causes is attacked by the passions even though he does not wish it.</p>
      <p> 120.  When evil thoughts become active within us, we should blame ourselves and not ancestral sin.</p>
      <p> 121.  The roots of evil thoughts are the obvious vices, which we keep trying to justify in our words and actions.</p>
      <p> 122.  We cannot entertain a passion in our mind unless we have a love for its causes.</p>
      <p> 123.  For what man, who cares nothing about being put to shame, entertains thoughts of self-esteem? Or who welcomes contempt and yet is disturbed by dishonor? And who has 'a broken and a contrite heart' (Ps. 51:17) and yet indulges in carnal pleasure? Or who puts his trust in Christ and yet worries or quarrels about transitory things?</p>
      <p> 124.  If a man is treated with contempt by someone and yet does not react with anger in either word or thought, it shows he has acquired real knowledge and firm faith in the Lord.</p>
      <p> 125.  'The sons of men are false, and cheat with their scales' (Ps. 62:9. LXX), but God assigns to each what is just.</p>
      <p> 126.  If the criminal will not keep his gains for ever and his victim will not always suffer want, 'surely man passes like a shadow and troubles himself in vain' (Ps. 39:6. LXX).</p>
      <p> 127.   When you see someone suffering great dishonor, you may be sure that he was carried away by thoughts of self-esteem and is now reaping, much to his disgust, the harvest from the seeds which he sowed in his heart.</p>
      <p> 128.   He who enjoys bodily pleasures beyond the proper limit will pay for the excess a hundredfold in sufferings. [VI] 136</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> 129.   A man exercising authority should tell his subordinate his duty; and, if disobeyed, should warn him of the evil consequences.</p>
      <p> 130.  He who suffers wrong and does not demand any reparation from the man who wronged him, trusts in Christ to make good the loss; and he is rewarded a hundredfold in this world and inherits eternal life (cf Mark 10:30).</p>
      <p> 131.   The remembrance of God is suffering of heart endured in a spirit of devotion. But he who forgets God becomes self-indulgent and insensitive.</p>
      <p> 132.  Do not say that a dispassionate man cannot suffer affliction: for even if he does not suffer on his own account, he is under a liability to do so for his neighbor.</p>
      <p> 133.   When the enemy has booked against a man many forgotten sins, he forces his debtor to recall them in memory, taking fall advantage of 'the law of sin' (cf. Rom. 8: 2).</p>
      <p> 134.  If you wish to remember God unceasingly, do not reject as undeserved what happens to you, but patiently accept it as your due. For patient acceptance of whatever happens kindles the remembrance of God, whereas refusal to accept weakens the spiritual purpose of the heart and so makes it forgetful.</p>
      <p> 135.  If you want your sins to be 'covered' by the Lord (cf. Ps. 32:1), do not display your virtues to others. For whatever we do with our virtues, God will also do with our sins.</p>
      <p> 136.  Having hidden your virtue, do not be filled with pride, imagining you have achieved righteousness. For righteousness is not only to hide your good actions, but also never to think forbidden thoughts.</p>
      <p> 137.  Rejoice, not when you do good to someone, but when you endure without rancor the hostility that follows. For just as night follows day, so acts of malice follow acts of kindness.</p>
      <p> 138.   Acts of kindness and generosity are spoilt by self-esteem, meanness and pleasure, unless these have first been destroyed by fear of God.</p>
      <p> 139.  The mercy of God is hidden in sufferings not of our choice, and if we accept such sufferings patiently, they bring us to repentance and deliver us from everlasting punishment.</p>
      <p> 140.  Some, when they actively observe the commandments, expect this to outweigh their sins; others, who observe the commandments without this presumption, gain the grace of Him who</p>
      <p> [VI] 137</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> died on account of our sins. We should consider which of these is right.</p>
      <p> 141.  Fear of hell and love for God's kingdom enable us patiently to accept affliction; and this they do, not by themselves, but through Him who knows our thoughts.</p>
      <p> 142.  He who believes in the blessings of the world to come abstains of his own accord from the pleasures of this present world. But he who lacks such faith becomes pleasure-loving and insensitive.</p>
      <p> 143.   Do not ask how a poor man can be self-indulgent when he lacks the material means. For it is possible to be self-indulgent in a yet more despicable way through one's thoughts.</p>
      <p> the first just as the sun outshines the moon.</p>
      <p> 145.   Knowledge of created beings increases the more we observe the commandments actively: but knowledge of the truth grows the more we hope in Christ.</p>
      <p> 146.  If you wish to be saved and 'to come unto the knowledge of the truth' (1 Tim. 2:4), endeavor always to transcend sensible things, and through hope alone to cleave to God. Then you will find principalities and powers fighting against you (cf Eph. 6:12), deflecting you against your will and provoking you to sin. But if you prevail over them through prayer and maintain your hope, you will receive God's grace, and this will deliver you from the wrath to come.</p>
      <p> 147.  If you understand what is said in a mystical sense by St Paul, that 'we wrestle . . . against spiritual wickedness' (Eph. 6:12), you will also understand the parable of the Lord, which He spoke 'to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to lose heart' (Luke 18:1).</p>
      <p> 148.  The Law figuratively commands men to work for six days and on the seventh to rest (cf. Exod. 20:9-10). The term 'work' when applied to the soul signifies acts of kindness and generosity by means of our possessions - that is, through material things. But the soul's rest and repose is to sell everything and 'give to the poor' (Matt. 19:21), as Christ Himself said: so through its lack of possessions it will rest from its work and devote itself to spiritual hope. Such is the rest into which Paul also exhorts us to enter, saying: 'Let us strive therefore to enter into that rest'(Heb. 4:11).</p>
      <p> [VI] 138</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> 149.  In saying this we are sot forgetting the blessings of the life to come or limiting the universal reward to the present life. We are simply affirming that it is necessary in the first place to have the grace of the Holy Spirit energizing the heart and so, in proportion to this energizing, to enter into the kingdom of heaven. The Lord made this clear in saying: 'The kingdom, of heaven is within you' (cf. Luke 17:21). The Apostle, too, said the same: 'Faith is the substance of things hoped for' (Heb. 11:1): 'Run, that you may reach your goal' (1 Cor. 9:24); 'Examine yourselves whether you are in the faith. ... Do you not know . . . that Jesus Christ is in you unless you are worthless' (2 Cor. 13:5).</p>
      <p> 150.  He who has come to know the truth does not oppose the afflictions that befall him, for he knows that they lead him to the fear of God.</p>
      <p> 151.  To recall past sins in detail inflicts injury on the man who hopes in God. For when such recollection brings remorse it deprives him of hope; but if he pictures the sins to himself without remorse, they pollute him again with the old defilement.</p>
      <p> 152.  When the intellect through rejection of the passions attains to unwavering hope, then the enemy makes it visualize its past sins on the pretext of confessing them to God. Thus he tries to rekindle passions which by God's grace have been forgotten, and so secretly to inflict injury. Then, even though someone is illumined and hates the passions, he will inevitably be filled with darkness and confusion at the memory of what he has done. But if he is still befogged and self-indulgent, he will certainly dally with the enemy's provocations and entertain them under the influence of passion, so that this recollection will prove to be a prepossession and not a confession.</p>
      <p> 153.  If you wish to make a blameless confession to God do not go over your failings in detail, but firmly resist their renewed attacks.</p>
      <p> 154.  Trials come upon us because of our former sins, bringing what is appropriate to each offence.</p>
      <p> 155.  The man who possesses spiritual knowledge and understands the truth confesses to God, not by recalling what he has done, but by accepting patiently what comes.</p>
      <p> 156.  If you refuse to accept suffering and dishonor, do not claim to be in a state of repentance because of your other virtues. For self-esteem and msensitivitv can serve sin even under the cover of virtue.</p>
      <p> [VI] 139</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> 157.  Just as suffering and dishonor usually give birth to virtues, so pleasure and self-esteem usually give birth to vices.</p>
      <p> 158.  All bodily pleasure results from previous laxity, and laxity results from lack of faith.</p>
      <p> 159.  He who is under the power of sin cannot by himself prevail over the will of the flesh, because he suffers continual stimulation in all his members.</p>
      <p> 160.  Those who are under the sway of passions must pray and be obedient. For even when they receive help, they can only just manage to fight against their preposessions.</p>
      <p> 161.   He who tries to conquer his own will by means of obedience and prayer is following a wise ascetic method. His renunciation of external things indicates his inward struggle.</p>
      <p> 162.   He who does not make his will agree with God is tripped up by his own schemes and falls into the hands of his enemies.</p>
      <p> 163.   When you see two evil men befriending one another, you may be sure that each is co-operating with the other's desires.</p>
      <p> 164.   The haughty and the conceited gladly agree together; for the haughty man praises the conceited man who fawns on him in a servile manner, while the conceited man extols the haughty man who continually praises him.</p>
      <p> 165.  The man who loves God benefits from both praise and blame: if commended for his good actions he grows more zealous, and if reproved for his sins he is brought to repentance. Our outward life should accord with our inner progress, and our prayers to God with our life.</p>
      <p> 166.  It is good to hold fast to the principal commandment, and not to be anxious about particular things or to pray for them specifically, but to seek only the kmgdom and the word of God (cf Matt. 6: 25-33). If, however, we are still anxious about our particular needs, we should also pray for each of them. He who does or plans anything without prayer will not succeed in the end. And this is what the Lord meant when He said; 'Without Me you can do nothing' (John 15:5).</p>
      <p> 167.  If a man disregards the commandment about prayer, he then commits worse acts of disobedience, each one handing him over to the next like a prisoner.</p>
      <p> 168.  He who accepts present afflictions in the expectation of</p>
      <p> [VI] 140</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> future blessings has found knowledge of the truth; and he will easily be freed from anger and remorse.</p>
      <p> 169.  He who chooses maltreatment and dishonor for the sake of truth is walking on the apostolic path: he has taken up the cross and is bound in chains (cf Matt. 16: 24: Acts 28:20). But when he tries to concentrate his attention on the heart without accepting these two, his intellect wanders from the path and he falls into the temptations and snares of the devil.</p>
      <p> 170.  In our ascetic warfare we can neither rid ourselves of evil thoughts apart from their causes, nor of their causes without ridding ourselves of the thoughts. For if we reject the one without the other, before long the other will involve us in them both at once.</p>
      <p> 171.  He who fights against others out of fear of hardship or reproach will either suffer more harshly through what befalls him in this life, or will be punished mercilessly in the life to come.</p>
      <p> 172.  He who wishes to be spared all misfortunes should associate God with everything through prayer: with his intellect he should set his hope in Him, putting aside, so far as possible, all concern about things of the senses.</p>
      <p> 173.   When the devil finds someone preoccupied needlessly with bodily things, he first deprives him of the hard-won fruits of spiritual knowledge, and then cuts off his hope in God.</p>
      <p> 174.   If you should ever reach the stronghold of pure prayer, do not accept the knowledge of created things which is presented to you at that moment by the enemy, lest you lose what is greater. For it is better to shoot at him from above with the arrows of prayer, cooped up as he is down below, then to parley with him as he offers us the knowledge he has plundered, and tries to tear us away from this prayer which defeats him.</p>
      <p> 175.  Knowledge of created things helps a man at a time of temptation and listlessness: but at a time of pure prayer it is usually harmful.</p>
      <p> 176.  If it is your task to give spiritual instruction and you are disobeyed, grieve inwardly but do not be outwardly upset. For if you grieve, you will not share the guilt of the person who disobeys you: but if you are upset you will be tested by the same temptations as he is.</p>
      <p> 177.   When you are explaining things, do not conceal what is [VI] 141</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> relevant to the needs of those present. You should discuss explicitly whatever is seemly, but refer less explicitly to what is hard to accept.</p>
      <p> 178.   If someone is not under obedience to you, do not rebuke him to his face for his faults. For that would imply you have authority over him, and are not just giving advice.</p>
      <p> 179.   What is said without explicit reference to individuals is helpful to all, for each applies it to himself according to his own conscience.</p>
      <p> 180.  He who speaks rightly should recognize that he receives the words from God. For the truth belongs not to him who speaks, but to God who is energizing him.</p>
      <p> 181.  Do not argue with people not under obedience to you when they oppose the truth; otherwise you may arouse their hatred.</p>
      <p> 182.  If you give way when someone who is under obedience to you wrongly contradicts you, you lead him astray over the point at issue and also encourage him to repudiate his promise of obedience.</p>
      <p> 183.  He who with fear of God admonishes or corrects a man who has sinned, gains the virtue that is opposite to that sin. But he who reproaches him out of rancor and ill will becomes subject to a similar passion, according to the spiritual law.</p>
      <p> 184.  He who has learned the law properly fears the Lawgiver and, fearing Him, he turns away from every evil.</p>
      <p> 185.  Do not be double-tongued, saying one thing when your conscience says another. For Scripture places such people under a curse (cf. Ecclus. 28:13).</p>
      <p> 186.  One man speaks the truth and is hated for it by the foolish: another speaks hypocritically and for this reason is loved. But in both cases their reward is not long delayed, for at the appropriate moment the Lord renders to each his due.</p>
      <p> 187.   He who wishes to avoid future troubles should endure his present troubles gladly. For in this way, balancing the one against the other, through small sufferings he will avoid those which are great.</p>
      <p> 188.  Guard your speech from boasting and your thoughts from presumption: otherwise you may be abandoned by God and fall into sin. For man cannot do anything good without the help of God, who sees everything.</p>
      <p> 189.  God, who sees everything, rewards at their proper value not only our actions but also our voluntary thoughts and purposes.</p>
      <p> [VI] 142</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> 190.   Involuntary thoughts arise from previous sin; voluntary ones from our free will. Thus the latter are the cause of the former.</p>
      <p> 191.   Evil thoughts which arise against our will are accompanied by remorse, and so they soon disappear; but when they are freely chosen, they are accompanied by pleasure, and so they are hard to get rid of.</p>
      <p> 192.  The self-indulgent are distressed by criticism and hardship; those who love God by praise and luxury.</p>
      <p> 193.  He who does not understand God's judgments walks on a ridge like a knife-edge and is easily unbalanced by every puff of wind. When praised, he exults; when criticized, he feels bitter. When he feasts, he makes a pig of</p>
      <p> himself; and when he suffers hardship, he moans and groans. When he understands, he shows off; and when he does not understand, he pretends that he does. When rich, he is boastful; and when in poverty, he plays the hypocrite. Gorged, he grows brazen; and when he fasts, he becomes arrogant. He quarrels with those who reprove him; and those who forgive him he regards as fools.</p>
      <p> 194.   Unless a man acquires, through the grace of Christ, knowledge of the truth and fear of God, he is gravely wounded not only by the passions but also by the things that happen to him.</p>
      <p> 195.   When you want to resolve a complex problem, seek God's will in the matter, and you will find a constructive solution.</p>
      <p> 196.   When something accords with God's will, all creation aids it. But when God rejects something, creation too opposes it.</p>
      <p> 197.   He who opposes unpleasant events opposes the command of God unwittingly. But when someone accepts them with real knowledge, he 'waits patiently for the Lord' (Ps. 27; 14).</p>
      <p> 198.   When tested by some trial you should try to find out not why or through whom it came, but only how to endure it gratefully, without distress or rancor.</p>
      <p> 199.  Another man's sin does not increase our own, unless we ourselves embrace it by means of evil thoughts.</p>
      <p> 200.   If it is not easy to find anyone conforming to God's will who has not been put to the test, we ought to thank God for everything that happens to us.</p>
      <p> 201.   If Peter had not failed to catch anything during the night's fishing (cf Luke 5:5), he would not have caught anything during the day. And if Paul had not suffered physical blindness (cf Acts</p>
      <p> [VI] 143</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> 9:8), he would not have been given spiritual sight. And if Stephen had not been slandered as a blasphemer, he would not have seen the heavens opened and have looked on God (cf Acts 6:15; 7:56).</p>
      <p> 202.  As work according to God is called virtue, so unexpected affliction is called a test.</p>
      <p> 203.  God 'tested Abraham' (cf. Gen. 22:1-14), that is, God afflicted him for his own benefit, not in order to learn what kind of man Abraham was - for He knew him, since He knows all things before they come into existence -but in order to provide him with opportunities for showing perfect faith.</p>
      <p> 204.  Every affliction tests our will, showing whether it is inclined to good or evil. This is why an unforeseen affliction is called a test, because it enables a man to test his hidden desires.</p>
      <p> 205.  The fear of God compels us to .fight against evil; and when we fight against evil, the grace of God destroys it.</p>
      <p> 206.  Wisdom is not only to perceive the natural consequence of things, but also to accept as our due the malice of those who wrong us. People who go no further than the first kind of wisdom become proud, whereas those who attain the second become humble.</p>
      <p> 207.  If you do not want evil thoughts to be active within you, accept humiliation of soul and affliction of the flesh; and this not just on particular occasions, but always, everywhere and in all things.</p>
      <p> who does not accept affliction is taken prisoner by evil thoughts, even though he resists them.</p>
      <p> 209.  When you are wronged and your heart and feehngs are hardened, do not be distressed, for this has happened providentiaUy; but be glad and reject the thoughts that arise within you, knowing that if they are destroyed at the stage when they are only provocations, their evil consequences will be cut off, whereas if the thoughts persist the evil may be expected to develop.</p>
      <p> 210.  Without contrition of the heart, it is altogether impossible to rid ourselves of evil. Now the heart is made contrite by threefold self-control: in sleep, in food and in bodily relaxation. For excess of these three things leads to self-indulgence: and this in turn makes us accept evil thoughts, and is opposed to prayer and to appropriate work.</p>
      <p> 211.   If it is your duty to give orders to your brethren, be mindful [VI] 144</p>
      <p> St. Mark the Ascetic</p>
      <p> On Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works</p>
      <p> Two Hundred and Twenty-Six Texts</p>
      <p> of your role and, when they contradict you, do not fail to tell them what is necessary. When they obey you, you will be rewarded because of their virtue; but when they disobey you, you will none the less forgive them, and will equally be rewarded by Him who said: 'Forgive and it shall be forgiven you' (cf Matt. 6:14).</p>
      <p> 212.   Every event is like a bazaar. He who knows how to bargain makes a good profit, he who does not makes a loss.</p>
      <p> 213.   If someone does not obey you when you have told him once, do not argue and try to compel him; but take for yourself the profit which he has thrown away. For forbearance will benefit you more than correcting him.</p>
      <p> 214.   When the evil conduct of one person begins to affect others, you should not show long-suffering; and instead of your own advantage you should seek that of the others, so that they may be saved. For virtue involving many people is more valuable than virtue involving only one.</p>
