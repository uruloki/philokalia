      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> (c. 580 - 662) (I'olume 2, pp. 48-305)</p>
      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> The extreme importance of St Maximos the Confessor (580-662) for the Orthodox spiritual tradition is indicated by the fact that no other writer is assigned so much space in the  Philokalia. A  member of the aristocracy, after receiving an elaborate education St Maximos served at first in the civil service, perhaps as secretary to the Emperor Heraklios. Around 614 he became a monk at the monastery of Philippikos in Chrysopolis (Scutari), close to Constantinople, subsequently moving to another monastery not far distant at Cyzikos (Erdek). In 626, at the time of the Persian invasion, he fled to Crete and eventually to Africa, where he remained for some years. From 633-4 onwards he played a leading part in opposing the heresies of Monoenergism and Monotheletism, and because of this he was arrested in 653 by the imperial authorities, brought to Constantinople for trial, and sent into exile. Further trials and condemnations followed, the last being at Constantinople in 662, after which he was flogged, his tongue was plucked out and his right hand cut off. He died soon afterwards as an exile in the Caucasus. His memorial is observed in the Orthodox Church on 21 January, and also on the day of his death, 13 August.</p>
      <p> In his numerous writings St Maximos discusses almost all aspects of Christian truth, including the interpretation of Scripture, the doctrine of the incarnation, ascetic practice, and the Divine Liturgy. He insists upon the close link between dogma and prayer. When he opposed Monotheletism, this was not because of some technicality, but because such a view subverted the understanding of the full reality of man's salvation and deification in Christ. The Monotheletes wished to reconcile the supporters of the Council of Chalcedon (451), who ascribed two natures to the incarnate Christ, with the Monophysites, who believed that He has only one nature; and so they proposed as a compromise the theory that Christ has two natures, the one divine and the other human, but only a single</p>

      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> will. Against this St Maximos maintained that human nature without a human will is an unreal abstraction: if Christ does not have a hu- man will as well as a divine will. He is not truly man; and if He is not truly man, the Christian message of salvation is rendered void. What we see in Christ our Saviour is precisely a human will, genuinely free</p>
      <p> yet held in unwavering obedience to His divine will; and it is by virtue of this voluntary co-operation of manhood with divinity in Christ, which restored the integrity of human nature, that we are enabled to make our own wills freely obedient to the will of God and so to attain salvation. St Maximos' teaching was confirmed after his death by the Sixth Ecumenical Council, meeting at Constantinople in 680-1.</p>
      <p> The Philokalia contains four works under the name of St Maximos:</p>
      <p> (1)  Four Hundred Texts on Love.  This is the most immediately attractive of all his works and also one of the easiest to understand. It is among his earlier writings, probably composed by 626, while he was at Cyzikos.^</p>
      <p> (2)  Two Hundred Texts on Theology and the Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God.  This seems to have been written in Africa between 63o and 634, and is far more complex in its argument. With remarkable subtlety St Maximos has adapted and drawn into a single synthesis ideas taken from Origen (c. 185- c. 254), Evagrios (345/6-399) and St Dionysios the Areopagite (c. 500).' Although doubts have sometimes been expressed, there seems no good reason to question the attribution to St Maximos.</p>
      <p> (3)  Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice  (500 in number). In the Greek edition of the  Philokalia  this is treated as a continuation of the preceding treatise.  Two Hundred Texts;  but in fact the two works are altogether distinct, and are treated as such in this translation. The  J'arious Texts,  in their present form, are not an authentic work of St Maximos himself but rather a</p>

      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> 'Maximian anthology', a collection of extracts from his writings made by a later compiler, probably not before the eleventh or twelfth century. The sources of this anthology are as follows:</p>
      <p> J'arious Texts  i, 1-25 cannot be traced in the known writings of St Maximos. The manuscript evidence strongly suggests that sections 1-15 are his genuine work; in the case of sections 16-25 Maximian authorship is less certain, but is not to be excluded.</p>
      <p> i, 26-47 are extracted from his  Letters.</p>
      <p> i, 48-v, 61 are taken from the treatise  To Thalassios: On J'arious Questions relating to Holy Scripture,  which was probably written in Africa during 630-4. Together with extracts from St Maximos, the compiler has also included many passages from the.  scholia  or commentaries on the work  To Thalassios: On J'arious Questions;  there is general agreement that these  scholia  are not by St Maximos himself and they probably date for the most part from the tenth century.</p>
      <p> V, 62-100 are taken from the  Ambiqua,  a discussion of disputed texts in the works of St Gregory of Nazianzos, which St Maximos wrote in Africa during 628-34. The compiler has inserted here some extracts from St Dionysios the Areopagite.</p>
      <p> In an appendix we have briefly indicated which of the  J'arious Texts  are from St Maximos, and which from the scholiast or St Dionysios.^ As can be seen from marginal notes in the Greek  Philokalia,  St Nikodimos and St Makarios realized that parts of the  J'arious Texts  came not from St Maximos himself but from the scholiast. Why, in that case, did they choose to include this later compilation, and not the original text of  To Thalassios: On J'arious Questions? A  possible answer is that the original text is very lengthy and at times highly obscure; the compiler, while sometimes increasing the obscurity by omitting vital passages, has on the whole selected the sections more immediately relevant to the spiritual life. Perhaps, then, by choosing the later anthology and not the original work, the editors hoped to render these writings accessible to a wider readership.</p>

      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Foreword to Elpidios the Presbyter</p>
      <p> In addition to my treatise on the ascetic life I am also sending you. Father Elpidios, this treatise on love divided, on the analogy of the four Gospels, into four centuries of chapters. It may not fulfill your expectations, but it is the best that I can do. Moreover, you should know. Father, that these chapters are not the products of my own mind. On the contrary, I have gone through the writings of the holy fathers and collected from them passages relevant to my subject, condensing much material into short paragraphs and in this way making it easy to remember and to assimilate.</p>
      <p> In sending these chapters to you I beg you to read them with sympathy and to seek out only what is profitable in them, overlooking the inelegant language. I also ask you to pray for my unworthy self, bereft as I am of all spiritual blessing. I have this request too: do not be annoyed by what I have written, for I have merely carried out what I was commanded to do. I say this because we who plague people with words are many nowadays, while those who teach or are taught by actions are very few.</p>
      <p> Please give careful attention to each chapter. For I suspect that not all the chapters are easy for everyone to understand. Many of them will need to be studied closely by most readers even if what they say seems to be very simple. If anything in these chapters should prove useful to the soul, it will be revealed to the reader by the grace of God, provided that he reads, not out of curiosity, but in the fear and love of God. If a man reads this or any other work not to gain spiritual benefit but to track down matter with which to abuse the author, so that in his conceit he can show himself to be the more learned, nothing profitable will ever be revealed to him in anything.</p>
      <p> [V2] 53</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> 1.  Love is a holy state of the soul, disposing it to value knowledge of God above all created things. We cannot attain lasting possession of such love while we are still attached to anything worldly.</p>
      <p> 2.  Dispassion engenders love, hope in God engenders dispassion, and patience and forbearance engender hope in God; these in turn are the product of complete self-control, which itself springs from fear of God. Fear of God is the result of faith in God.</p>
      <p> 3.  If you have faith in the Lord you will fear punishment, and this fear will lead you to control the passions. Once you control the passions you will accept affliction patiently, and through such acceptance you will acquire hope in God. Hope in God separates the intellect from every worldly attachment, and when the intellect is detached in this way it will acquire love for God.</p>
      <p> 4.  The person who loves God values knowledge of God more than anything created by God, and pursues such knowledge ardently and ceaselessly.</p>
      <p> 5.   If everything that exists was made by God and for God, and God is superior to the things made by Him, he who abandons what is superior and devotes himself to what is inferior shows that he values things made by God more than God Himself.</p>
      <p> 6.  When your mtellect is concentrated on the love of God you will pay little attention to visible things and will regard even your own body as something alien.</p>
      <p> 7.  Since the soul is more noble than the body and God incomparably more noble than the world created by Him, he who values the body more than the soul and the world created by God more than the Creator Himself is simply a worshipper of idols.</p>
      <p> 8.  If you distract your intellect from its love for God and</p>
      <p> [V2] 54</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love First Century</p>
      <p> concentrate it, not on God, but on some sensible object, you thereby show that you value the body more than the soul and the things made by God more than God Himself.</p>
      <p> 9.  Since the light of spiritual knowledge is the intellect's life, and since this light is engendered by love for God, it is rightly said that nothing is greater than divine love (cf 1 Cor. 13:13).</p>
      <p> 10.  When in the intensity of its love for God the intellect goes out of itself, then it has no sense of itself or of any created thing. For when it is illumined by the infinite light of God, it becomes insensible to everything made by</p>
      <p> Him, just as the eye becomes insensible to the stars when the sun rises.</p>
      <p> 1L AU the virtues co-operate with the inteUect to produce this intense longing for God, pure prayer above all. For by soaring towards God through this prayer the intellect rises above the realm of created beings.</p>
      <p> 12.  When the intellect is ravished through love by divine knowledge and stands outside the realm of created beings, it becomes aware of God's infinity. It is then, according to Isaiah, that a sense of amazement makes it conscious of its own lowliness and in all sincerity it repeats the prophet's words: 'How abject I am, for I am pierced to the heart; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among a people of unclean lips: and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts' (Isa. 6:5).</p>
      <p> 13.  The person who loves God cannot help loving every man as himself, even though he is grieved by the passions of those who are not yet purified. But when they amend their lives, his delight is indescribable and knows no bounds.</p>
      <p> 14.  A soul filled with thoughts of sensual desire and hatred is unpurified.</p>
      <p> 15.  If we detect any trace of hatred in our hearts against any man whatsoever for committing any fault, we are utterly estranged from love for God, since love for God absolutely precludes us from hating any man.</p>
      <p> 16.  He who loves Me, says the Lord, will keep My commandments (cf. John 14:15, 23); and 'this is My commandment, that you love one another' (John 15:12). Thus he who does not love his neighbor fails to keep the commandment, and so cannot love the Lord.</p>
      <p> 17.  Blessed is he who can love all men equally.</p>
      <p> [V2] 55</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> 18.  Blessed is he who is not attached to anything transitory or corruptible.</p>
      <p> 20.   If you make provision for the desires of the flesh (cf. Rom. 13:14) and bear a grudge against your neighbor on account of something transitory, you worship the creature instead of the Creator.</p>
      <p> 21.  If you keep your body free from disease and sensual pleasure it will help you to serve what is more noble.</p>
      <p> 22.  He who forsakes all worldly desires sets himself above all worldly distress.</p>
      <p> 23.  He who loves God will certainly love his neighbor as well. Such a person cannot hoard money, but distributes it in a way befitting God, being generous to everyone in need.</p>
      <p> 24.  He who gives alms in imitation of God does not discriminate between the wicked and the virtuous, the just and the unjust, when providing for men's bodily needs. He gives equally to all according to their need, even though he prefers the virtuous man to the bad man because of the probity of his intention.</p>
      <p> 25.  God, who is by nature good and dispassionate, loves all men equally as His handiwork. But He glorifies the virtuous man because in his will he is united to God. At the same time, in His goodness He is merciful to the sinner and by chastising him in this life brings him back to the path of virtue. Similarly, a man of good and dispassionate judgment also loves all men equally. He loves the virtuous man because of his nature and the probity of his intention: and he loves the sinner, too, because of his nature and because in his compassion he pities him for foolishly stumbling in darkness.</p>
      <p> 26.  The state of love may be recognized in the giving of money, and still more in the giving of spiritual counsel and in looking after people in their physical needs.</p>
      <p> 27.   He who has genuinely renounced worldly things, and lovingly and sincerely serves his neighbor, is soon set free from every passion and made a partaker of God's love and knowledge.</p>
      <p> 28.  He who has realized love for God in his heart is tireless, as Jeremiah says (cf Jer. 17:16. LXX), in his pursuit of the Lord his God, and bears every hardship, reproach and insult nobly, never thinking the least evil of anyone.</p>
      <p> [V2] 56</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love First Century</p>
      <p> 29.  When you are insulted by someone or iiumiliated, guard against angry thoughts, lest they arouse a feeling of irritation, and so cut you off from love .and place you in the realm of hatred.</p>
      <p> 30.  You should know that you Save been greatly benefited when you have suffered deeply because of some insult or indignity; for by means of the indignity self-esteem has been driven out of you.</p>
      <p> 31.  Just as the thought of fire does not warm the body, so faith without love does not actualize the light of spiritual knowledge in the soul.</p>
      <p> 32.   Just as the light of the sun attracts a healthy eye, so through love knowledge of God naturally draws to itself the pure intellect.</p>
      <p> 33.  A pure intellect is one divorced from ignorance and illumined by divine light.</p>
      <p> 34.  A pure soul is one freed from passions and constantly delighted by divine love.</p>
      <p> 35.  A culpable passion is an impulse of the soul that is contrary to nature.</p>
      <p> 36.  Dispassion is a peaceful condition of the soul in which the soul is not easily moved to evil.</p>
      <p> 37.   A man who has been assiduous in acquiring the fruits of love will not cease loving even if he suffers a thousand calamities. Let Stephen, the disciple of Christ, and others like him persuade you of the truth of this (cf Acts 7:60). Our Lord Himself prayed for His murderers and asked the Father to forgive them because they did not know what they were doing (cf. Luke 23:34).</p>
      <p> 38.  If love is long-suffering and kind (cf. 1 Cor. 13:4), a man who is contentious and malicious clearly alienates himself from love. And he who is alienated from love is alienated from God, for God is love.</p>
      <p> 39.  Do not say that you are the temple of the Lord, writes Jeremiah (cf. Jer. 7:4); nor should you say that faith alone in our Lord Jesus Christ can save you, for this is impossible unless you also acquire love for Him through your works. As for faith by itself, "the devils also believe, and tremble'(Jas. 2:19).</p>
      <p> 40.  We actively manifest love in forbearance and patience towards our neighbor, in genuinely desiring his good, and in the right use of material things.</p>
      <p> 41.   He who loves God neither distresses nor is distressed with anyone on account of transitory things. There is only one kind of</p>
      <p> [V2] 57</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> distress which he both suffers and inflicts on others: that salutary distress which the blessed Paul suffered and which he inflicted on the Corinthians (cf 2 Cor. 7:8-11).</p>
      <p> 42.  He who loves God lives the angelic life on earth, fasting and keeping vigils, praying and singing psalms and always thinking good of every man.</p>
      <p> 43.   If a man desires something, he makes every effort to attain it. But of all things which are good and desirable the divine is incomparably the best and the most desirable. How assiduous, then, we should be in order to attain what is of its very nature good and desirable.</p>
      <p> 44.  Stop defiling your flesh with shameful deeds and polluting your soul with wicked thoughts; then the peace of God will descend upon you and bring you love.</p>
      <p> 45.  Afflict your flesh with hunger and vigils and apply yourself tirelessly to psalmody and prayer; then the sanctifying gift of self-restraint will descend upon you and bring you love.</p>
      <p> 46.  He who has been granted divme knowledge and has through love acquired its illumination will never be swept hither and thither by the demon of self-esteem. But he who has not yet been granted such knowledge will readily succumb to this demon. However, if in all that he does he keeps his gaze fixed on God, doing everythmg for His sake, he will with God's help soon escape.</p>
      <p> 47.  He who has not yet attained divme knowledge energized by love is proud of his spiritual progress. But he who has been granted such knowledge repeats with deep conviction the words uttered by the patriarch Abraham</p>
      <p> when he was granted the manifestation of God: 'I am dust and ashes' (Gen. 18:27).</p>
      <p> 48.  The person who fears the Lord has humihty as his constant companion and, through the thoughts which humihty inspires, reaches a state of divine love and thankfulness. For he recalls his former worldly way of life, the various sins he has committed and the temptations which have befallen him since his youth: and he recalls, too, how the Lord delivered him from all this, and how He led him away from a passion-dominated life to a life ruled by God. Then, together with fear, he also receives love, and in deep humility continually gives thanks to the Benefactor and Helmsman of our lives.</p>
      <p> 49.  Do not befoul your intellect by clinging to thoughts filled</p>
      <p> [V2] 58</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love First Century</p>
      <p> with anger and sensual desire. Otherwise you will lose your capacity for pure prayer and fall victim to the demon of listlessness.</p>
      <p> 50.  When the intellect associates with evil and sordid thoughts it loses its intimate communion with God.</p>
      <p> 51.  The foolish man under attack from the passions, when stirred to anger, is senselessly impelled to leave his brethren. But when heated by desire he quickly changes his mind and seeks their company. An intelligent person behaves differently in both cases. When anger flares up he cuts off the source of disturbance and so frees himself from his feeling of irritation against his brethren. When desire is uppermost he checks every unruly impulse and chance conversation.</p>
      <p> 52.   In time of trial do not leave your monastery but stand up courageously against the thoughts that surge over you, especially those of irritation and listlessness. For when you have been tested by afflictions in this way, accordmg to divine providence, your hope in God will become firm and secure. But if you leave, you will show yourself to be worthless, unmanly and fickle.</p>
      <p> 53.  If you wish not to fall away from the love of God, do not let your brother go to bed feeling irritated with you, and do not go to bed yourself feeling irritated with him. Reconcile yourself with your brother, and then come to Christ with a clear conscience and offer Him your gift of love in earnest prayer (cf Matt. 5:24).</p>
      <p> 54.   St Paul says that, if we have aU the gifts of the Spirit but do not have love, we are no further forward (of. 1 Cor. 13:2). How assiduous, then, we ought to be in our efforts to acquire this love.</p>
      <p> 55.  If 'love prevents us from harming our neighbor' (Rom. 13:10). he who is jealous of his brother or irritated by his reputation, and damages his good name with cheap jibes or in any way spitefully plots against him, is surely alienating himself from love and is guilty in the face of eternal judgment.</p>
      <p> 56.   If love is the fulfilling of the law' (Rom. 13:10), he who is full of rancor towards his neighbor and lays traps for him and curses him, exulting in his fall, must surely be a transgressor deserving eternal punishment.</p>
      <p> 57.  If 'he who speaks evil of his brother, and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law, and judges the law' (Jas. 4:11), and the law of Christ is love, surely he who speaks evil of Christ's love falls away from it and is the cause of his own perdition.</p>
      <p> [V2] 59</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> 58.  Do not listen gleefully to gossip at your neighbor's expense or chatter to a person who likes finding fault. Otherwise you will fall away from divine love and find yourself cut off from eternal life.</p>
      <p> 59.  Do not permit any abuse of your spiritual father or encourage anyone who dishonors him. Otherwise the Lord will be angry with your conduct and will obliterate you from the land of the livmg (cf. Deut. 6:15).</p>
      <p> 60.  Silence the man who utters slander in your hearing. Otherwise you sin twice over: first, you accustom yourself to this deadly passion and, second you fail to prevent him from gossiping against his neighbor.</p>
      <p> 61.  'But I say to you," says the Lord, 'love your enemies ... do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you' (Matt. 5:44). Why did He command this? To free you from hatred, irritation, anger and rancor, and to make you worthy of the supreme gift of perfect love. And you cannot attain such love if you do not imitate God and love all men equally. For God loves all men equally and wishes them 'to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth' (1 Tim. 2:4).</p>
      <p> 62.  'But I say to you, do not resist evil; but if someone hits you on the right cheek, turn to him the other cheek as well. And if anyone sues you in the courts, and takes away your coat, let him have your cloak also. And if anyone forces you to go a mile, go with him for two miles' (Matt. 5:39-41). Why did He say this? Both to keep you free from anger and irritation, and to correct the other person by means of your forbearance, so that like a good Father He might bring the two of you under the yoke of love.</p>
      <p> 63.  We carry about with us impassioned images of the things we have experienced. If we can overcome these images we shall be indifferent to the thmgs which they represent. For fighting against the thoughts of things is much harder than fightmg against the things themselves, just as to sin in the mind is easier than to sin through outward action.</p>
      <p> 64. Some passions pertain to the body, others to the soul. The first are occasioned by the body, the second by external objects. Love and self-control overcome both kinds, the first curbing the passions of the soul and the second those of the body.</p>
      <p> 65.  Some passions pertain to the soul's incensive power, and</p>
      <p> [V2] 60</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love First Century</p>
      <p> others to its desiring aspect. Both kinds are aroused through the senses. They are aroused when the soul lacks love and self-control.</p>
      <p> 66.  The passions of the soul's mcensive power are more difficult to combat than those of its desiring aspect. Consequently our Lord has given a stronger remedy against them; the commandment of love.</p>
      <p> 67.   While passions such as forgetfulness and ignorance affect but one of the soul's three aspects - the incensive, the desiring or the intelligent - listlessness alone seizes control of all the soul's powers and rouses almost all the passions together. That is why this passion is more serious than all the others. Hence our Lord has given us an excellent remedy against it, saying: "You will gain possession of your souls through your patient endurance' (Luke 21:19).</p>
      <p> 68.  Never strike any of the brethren, especially without reason, in case he is unable to bear the affliction and leaves the monastery. For then you would never escape the reproach of your conscience. It would always bring you distress in the time of prayer and divert your intellect from intimate communion with God.</p>
      <p> 69.  Shun all suspicions and all persons that cause you to take offence. If you are offended by anything, whether intended or unintended, you do not know the way of peace, which through love brings the lovers of divine knowledge to the knowledge of God.</p>
      <p> 70.  You have not yet acquired perfect love if your regard for people is still swayed by their characters - for example, if, for some particular reason, you love one person and hate another, or if for the same reason you sometimes love and sometimes hate the same person.</p>
      <p> 71.   Perfect love does not split up the single human nature, common to all, according to the diverse characteristics of individuals; but, fixing attention always on this single nature, it loves all men equally. It loves the good as friends and the bad as enemies, helping them, exercising forbearance, patiently accepting whatever they do, not taking the evil into account at all but even suffering on their behalf if the opportunity offers, so that, if possible, they too become friends. If it cannot achieve this, it does not change its own attitude; it continues to show the fruits of love to all men alike. It was on account of this that our Lord and God Jesus Christ, showing His love for us, suffered for the whole of mankind and gave to all men an equal hope of resurrection, although each man determines his own fitness for glory or punishment.</p>
      <p> [V2] 61</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love First Century</p>
      <p> 72.  If you are not indifferent to both fame and dishonor, riches and poverty, pleasure and distress, you have not yet acquired perfect love. For perfect love is indifferent not only to these but even to this fleeting life and to death.</p>
      <p> 73.   Listen to the words of those who have been granted perfect love: 'What can separate us from the love of Christ? Can affliction, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or the sword? As it is written, "For Thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we are regarded as sheep for slaughtering (Ps. 44:22). But in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us. For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord' (Rom. 8:35-39). Those who speak and act thus with regard to divine love are all saints.</p>
      <p> 74.   Listen now to what they say about love for our neighbor: 'I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie, my conscience also bears me witness in the Holy Spirit: I have great distress and continual sorrow in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were severed from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are Israelites' (Rom. 9:1-3). Moses and the other saints speak in a similar manner.</p>
      <p> 75.  He who is not indifferent to fame and pleasure, as well as to the love of riches that exists because of them and increases them, cannot cut off occasions for anger. And he who does not cut these off cannot attain perfect love.</p>
      <p> 76.  Humility and ascetic hardship free a man from all sin, for the one cuts out the passions of the soul, the other those of the body. This is what the blessed David indicates when he prays to God, saying, 'Look on my humility and my toil, and forgive all my sins' (Ps. 25:18).</p>
      <p> 77.  It is through our fulfilling of the commandments that the Lord makes us dispassionate; and it is through His divme teachings that He gives us the light of spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 78.  All such teachings are concerned either with God, or with things visible and invisible, or eke with the providence and judgment relating to them.</p>
      <p> 79.  Almsgiving heals the soul's mcensive power; fasting withers</p>
      <p> [V2] 62</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love First Century</p>
      <p> sensual desire; prayer purifies the intellect and prepares it for the contemplation of created beings. For the Lord has given us commandments which correspond to the powers of the soul.</p>
      <p> ^0. 'Learn from Me', He said 'for I am gentle and humble in heart" (Matt. 11:29). Gentleness keeps the soul's incensive power in a calm state; humility frees the intellect from conceit and self-esteem.</p>
      <p> 1 1. Fear of God is of two kinds. The first is generated in us by the threat of punishment. It is through such fear that we develop in due order self-control, patience, hope in God and dispassion; and it is from dispassion that love comes. The second kind of fear is linked with love and constantly produces reverence in the soul, so that it does</p>
      <p> not grow indifferent to God because of the intimate communion of its love.</p>
      <p> 82.  The first kind of fear is expeUed by perfect love when the soul has acquired this and is no longer afraid of punishment (cf. 1 John 4:18). The second kind, as we have already said, is always found united with perfect love. The first kind of fear is referred to in the following two verses: 'Out of fear of the Lord men shun eviP (Prov. 16:6), and Tear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom' (Ps. 111:10). The second kind is mentioned in the following verses: 'Fear of the Lord is pure, and endures for ever' (Ps. 19:9. LXX), and "Those who fear the Lord will not want for anything" (Ps. 34:10. LXX).</p>
      <p> 83.  'Put to death therefore whatever is earthly in you: unchastity, uncleanliness, passion, evil desire and greed' (Col. 3:5). Earth is the name St Paul gives to the will of the flesh. Unchastity is his word for the actual committing of sin. Uncleanness is how he designates assent to sin. Passion is his term for impassioned thoughts. By evil desire he means the simple act of accepting the thought and the desire. And greed is his name for what generates and promotes passion. All these St Paul ordered us to mortify as 'aspects' expressing the will of the flesh.</p>
      <p> 84.  First the memory brings some passion-free thought into the intellect. By its lingering there, passion is aroused. When the passion is not eradicated, it persuades the intellect to assent to it. Once this assent is given, the actual sin is then committed. Therefore, when writing to converts from paganism, St Paul in his wisdom orders them first to eliminate the actual sin and then systematically to work back to the cause. The cause, as we have already said, is</p>
      <p> [V2] 63</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> greed, which generates and promotes passion. I think that greed in this case means gluttony, because this is the mother and nurse of unchastity. For greed is a sin not only with regard to possessions hut also with regard to food, just as self-control likewise relates to both food and possessions.</p>
      <p> 85. When a sparrow tied by the leg tries to fly, it is held back by the string and pulled down to the earth. Similarly, when the intellect that has not yet attained dispassion flies up towards heavenly knowledge, it is held back by the passions and pulled down to the earth.</p>
      <p> 86.  The intellect, once totally free from passions, proceeds un-distracted to the contemplation of created beings, making its way towards knowledge of the Holy Trinity.</p>
      <p> 87.  When in a pure state, the intellect, on receiving the conceptual images of things, is moved to contemplate these things spiritually. But when it is sullied through indolence, while its conceptual images may in general be free from passion, those concerned with people produce in it thoughts that are shameful or wicked.</p>
      <p> 88.  When during prayer no conceptual image of anything worldly disturbs your intellect, then know that you are within the realm of dispassion.</p>
      <p> 89.  Once the soul starts to feel its own good health, the images in its dreams are also calm and free from passion.</p>
      <p> 90.  Just as the physical eye is attracted to the beauty of things visible, so the purified intellect is attracted to the knowledge of things invisible. By things invisible, I mean things incorporeal.</p>
      <p> 91.  It is already much not to be roused to any passion by material things. It is even more to remain dispassionate when presented with mental images of such things. For the war which the demons wage against us by means of thoughts is more severe than the war they wage by means of material things.</p>
      <p> 92.  He who has succeeded in attaining the virtues and is enriched with spiritual knowledge sees things clearly in their true nature. Consequently, he both acts and speaks with regard to all things in a manner which is fitting, and he is never deluded. For according to whether we use things rightly or wrongly we become either good or bad.</p>
      <p> 93.  If the conceptual images that continually rise up in the heart are free from passion whether the body is awake or asleep, then we may know that we have attained the highest state of dispassion.</p>
      <p> [V2] 64</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> 94.  Through fulfilling the commandments the intellect strip itself of the passions. Through spiritual contemplation of things visible it casts off impassioned conceptions of such things. Through knowledge of things invisible it</p>
      <p> discards the contemplation of things visible. Finally it denudes itself even of this through knowledge of the Holy Trinity.</p>
      <p> 95.  When the sun rises and casts its light on the world, it reveals both itself and the things it illumines. Similarly, when the Sun of righteousness rises in the pure intellect. He reveals both Himself and the inner principles of all that has been and will be brought into existence by Him.</p>
      <p> 96.  We do not know God from His essence. We know Him rather from the grandeur of His creation and from His providential care for all creatures. For through these, as though they were mirrors, we may attain insight into His infinite goodness, wisdom and power.</p>
      <p> 97.  The pure intellect is occupied either with passion-free conceptual images of human affairs, or with the natural contemplation of things visible or invisible, or with the light of the Holy Trinity.</p>
      <p> 98.  When the intellect is engaged in the contemplation of thmgs visible, it searches out either the natural principles of these things or the spiritual principles which they reflect, or else it seeks their original cause.</p>
      <p> 99.  When the intellect is absorbed in the contemplation of things invisible, it seeks their natural principles, the cause of their generation and whatever follows from this, as well as the providential order and judgment which relates to them.</p>
      <p> 100. When the intellect is established in God, it at first ardently longs to discover the principles of His essence. But God's inmost nature does not admit of such investigation, which is indeed beyond the capacity of everything created. The qualities that appertain to His nature, however, are accessible to the intellect's longing: I mean the qualities of eternity, infinity, mdeterminateness, goodness, wisdom, and the power of creating, preserving and judging creatures. Yet of these, only infinity may be grasped fully; and the very fact of knowing nothing is knowledge surpassing the intellect, as the theologians Gregory of Nazianzos and Dionysios have said.</p>
      <p> [V2] 65</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> 1.    He who truly loves God prays entirely without distraction, and he who prays entirely without distraction loves</p>
      <p> God truly. But he whose intellect is fixed on any worldly thing does not pray without distraction, and consequently he does not love God.</p>
      <p> 2.  The intellect that dallies with some sensible thing clearly is attached to it by some passion, such as desire, irritation, anger or rancor: and unless it becomes detached from that thing it will not be able to free itself from the passion affecting it.</p>
      <p> 3.  When passions dominate the intellect, they separate it from God, binding it to material things and preoccupying it with them. But when love of God dominates the intellect, it frees it from its bonds, persuading it to rise above not only sensible things but even this transitory life.</p>
      <p> 4.  The effect of observing the commandments is to free from passion our conceptual images of things. The effect of spiritual reading and contemplation is to detach the intellect from form and matter. It is this which gives rise to undistracted prayer.</p>
      <p> 5.  Unless various successive spiritual contemplations also occupy the intellect, the practice of virtues by itself cannot free it so entirely from passions that it is able to pray undistractedly. Practice of the virtues frees the intellect only from dissipation and hatred; spiritual contemplation releases it also from forgetfulness and ignorance. In this way the intellect can pray as it should.</p>
      <p> 6.  Two states of pure prayer are exalted above all others. One is to be found in those who have not advanced beyond the practice of the virtues, the other in those leading the contemplative life. The first is engendered in the soul by fear of God and a firm hope in Him, the second by an intense longing for God and by total purification. The sign of the first is that the intellect, abandoning all conceptual</p>
      <p> [V2] 66</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love Second Century</p>
      <p> images of the world, concentrates itself and prays without distraction or disturbance as if God Himself were present, as indeed He is. The sign of the second is that at the very onset of prayer the intellect is so ravished by the divine and infinite light that it is aware neither of itself nor of any other created thing, but only of Him who through love has activated such radiance in-it. It is then that, being made aware of God's qualities, it receives clear and distinct reflections of Him.</p>
      <p> 7.  Whatever a man loves he inevitably clings to, and in order not to lose it he rejects everything that keeps him from it. So he who loves God cultivates pure prayer, driving out every passion that keeps him from it.</p>
      <p> 8.  He who drives out self-love, the mother of the passions, will with God's help easily rid himself of the rest, such as anger, irritation, rancor and so on. But he who is dominated by self-love is overpowered by the other passions, even against his will. Self-love is the passion of attachment to the body.</p>
      <p> 9.  Men love one another, commendably or reprehensibly, for the following five reasons; either for the sake of God, as the virtuous man loves everyone and as the man not yet virtuous loves the virtuous : or by nature, as parents love their children and children their parents: or because of self-esteem, as he who is praised loves the man who praises him: or because of avarice, as with one who loves a rich man for what he can get out of him; or because of self-indulgence, as with the man who serves his belly and his genitals. The first of these is commendable, the second is of an intermediate kind, the rest are dominated by passion.</p>
      <p> 10.  If there are some men you hate and some you neither love nor hate, and others you love strongly and others again you love but moderately, recognize from this inequality that you are far from perfect love. For perfect love presupposes that you love all men equally.</p>
      <p> 11.   'Shun evil and do good" (Ps. 34:14), that is to say, fight the enemy in order to diminish the passions, and then be vigilant lest they increase once more. Again, fight to acquire the virtues and then be vigilant in order to keep them. This is the meaning of "cultivating' and 'keeping' (cf. Gen. 2:15).</p>
      <p> 12.   Those permitted by God to test us either inflame the desiring aspect of the soul, or stir up its mcensive power, or darken its</p>
      <p> [V2] 67</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> intelligence, or envelop its body in pain, or deprive us of bodily necessities.</p>
      <p> 13. The demons either tempt us themselves or arm against us those who have no fear of the Lord. They tempt us themselves when we withdraw from human society, as they, tempted our Lord in the desert. They tempt us through other people when we spend our time in the company of others, as they tempted our Lord through the Pharisees. But whichever line of attack they choose, let us repel them by keeping our gaze fixed on the Lord's</p>
      <p> example.</p>
      <p> 14.  When the intellect begins to advance in love for God, the demon of blasphemy starts to tempt it, suggesting thoughts such as no man but only the devil, their father, could invent. He does this out of envy, so that the man of God, in his despair at thinking such thoughts, no longer dares to soar up to God in his accustomed prayer. But the demon does not further his own ends by this means. On the contrary, he makes us more steadfast. For through his attacks and our retaliation we grow more experienced and genuine in our love for God. May his sword enter into his own heart and may his bows be broken (cf. Ps. 37:15).</p>
      <p> 15.  When the intellect turns its attention to the visible world, it perceives things through the medium of the senses in a way that accords with nature. And the intellect is not evil, nor is its natural capacity to form conceptual images of things, nor are the things themselves, nor are the senses, for all are the work of God. What, then, is evil? Clearly it is the passion that enters into the conceptual images formed in accordance with nature by the intellect: and this need not happen if the intellect keeps watch.</p>
      <p> 16.  Passion is an impulse of the soul contrary to nature, as in the case of mindless love or mindless hatred for someone or for some sensible thing. In the case of love, it may be for needless food, or for a woman, or for money, or for transient glory, or for other sensible objects or on their account. In the case of hatred, it may be for any of the things mentioned, or for someone on account of these things.</p>
      <p> 17.  Again, vice is the wrong use of our conceptual images of things, which leads us to misuse the things themselves. In relation to women, for example, sexual intercourse, rightly used, has as its purpose the begetting of children. He, therefore, who seeks in it only sensual pleasure uses it wrongly, for he reckons as good what is</p>
      <p> [V2] 68</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love Second Century</p>
      <p> not good. When such a man has intercourse with a woman, he misuses her. And the same is true with regard to other things and our conceptual images of them.</p>
      <p> 18. When the demons expel self-restraint from your intellect and besiege you with thoughts of unchastity, turn to the Lord with tears and say, 'Now they have driven me out and encircled me" (Ps. 17:11. LXX); 'Thou art my supreme joy: deliver me from those who encircle me' (Ps. 32:7. LXX). Then you will be safe.</p>
      <p> 19.  The demon of unchastity is powerful and violently attacks those who struggle against passion, particularly if they are lax about matters of diet and often meet women. With the lubricity of sensual pleasure he imperceptibly steals into the intellect and thereafter persecutes the hesychast by means of the memory, setting his body on fire and presenting various forms to his intellect. In this way he evokes his assent to sin. If you do not want these forms to linger in you, turn again to fasting, labor, vigils and blessed stillness with intense prayer.</p>
      <p> 20.   Those who are always trying to lay hold of our soul do so by means of impassioned thoughts, so that they may drive it to sin either in the mind or in action. Consequently, when they find the intellect unreceptive, they will be disgraced and put to shame, and when they find the intellect occupied with spiritual contemplation, they will 'be turned back and suddenly ashamed' (Ps. 6:10).</p>
      <p> 21.  He who anoints his intellect for spiritual contest and drives all impassioned thoughts out of it has the quality of a deacon. He who illuminates his intellect with the knowledge of created beings and utterly destroys false knowledge has the quality of a priest. And he who perfects his intellect with the holy myrrh of the knowledge and worship of the Holy Trinity has the quality of a bishop.</p>
      <p> 22.  The demons are weakened when the passions in us decrease through our keeping the commandments, and they are defeated totally when they are routed by dispassion, for then they no longer find anything through which they can enter the soul and fight against it. This is what is meant by 'they will be weakened and defeated before Thy face' (Ps. 9:3).</p>
      <p> 23.  Some men abstain from the passions because of human fear, others because of self-esteem, and others through self-control. Some, however, are delivered from the passions by divine providence.</p>
      <p> [V2] 69</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> 24. All the discourses of our Lord contain these four elements: commandments, doctrines, threats and promises. With the help of these we patiently accept every kind of hardship, such as fasting, vigils, sleeping on the ground, toil and labor in acts of service, insults, dishonor, torture, death and so on. 'Helped by the words of Thy lips,' says the psalmist, I have kept to difficult paths' (Ps. 17:4. LXX).</p>
      <p> 25.  The reward of self-control is dispassion, and the reward of faith is spiritual knowledge. Dispassion engenders discrimination, and spiritual knowledge engenders love for God.</p>
      <p> 26.  When the intellect practices the virtues correctly, it advances in moral understanding. When it practices contemplation, it advances in spiritual knowledge. The first leads the spiritual contestant to discriminate between virtue and vice; the second leads the participant to the inner qualities of incorporeal and corporeal things. Finally, the intellect is granted the grace of theology when, carried on wings of love beyond these two former stages, it is taken up into God and with the help of the Holy Spirit discerns - as far as this is possible for the human mtellect - the qualities of God.</p>
      <p> 27.   If you are about to enter the realm of theology, do not seek to descry God's inmost nature, for neither the human intellect nor that of any other being under God can experience this: but try to discern, as far as possible, the qualities that appertain to His nature - qualities of eternity, infinity, mdeterminateness, goodness, wisdom, and the power of creating, preserving and judging creatures, and so on. For he who discovers these qualities, to however small an extent, is a great theologian.</p>
      <p> 28.  He who combines the practice of the virtues with spiritual knowledge is a man of power. For with the first he withers his desire and tames his mcensiveness, and with the second he gives wings to his intellect and goes out of himself to God.</p>
      <p> 29. When our Lord says, 'I and My Father are one" (John 10:30), He indicates their identity of essence. Again, when He says, 'I am in the Father, and the Father in Me' (John 14:11), He shows that the Persons cannot be divided. The tntheists, therefore, who divide the Son from the Father, find themselves in a dilemma. Either they say that the Son is coetemal with the Father, but nevertheless</p>
      <p> [V2] 70</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> divide Him from the Father, and so they are forced to say that He is not begotten from the Father: thus they fell into the error of claiming that there are three Gods and three first principles. Or else they say that the Son is begotten from the Father but nevertheless divide Him from the Father, and so they are forced to say that He is not coetemal with the Father; thus they make the Lord of time subject to time. For, as St Gregory of Nazianzos says, it is</p>
      <p> necessary both to maintain the one God and to confess the three Persons, each in His own individuality. According to St Gregory, the Divinity is divided but without division and is united but with distinctions. Because of this both the division and the union are paradoxical. For what paradox would there be if the Son were united to the Father and divided from Him only in the same manner as one human being is united to and divided from another, and nothing more?</p>
      <p> 30.  For him who is perfect in love and has reached the summit of dispassion there is no difference between his own or another's, or between Christians and unbelievers, or between slave and free, or even between male and female. But because he has risen above the tyranny of the passions and has fixed his attention on the single nature of man, he looks on all in the same way and shows the same disposition to all. For in him there is neither Greek nor Jew, male nor female, bond nor free, but Christ who 'is all, and in all' (Col. 3:11; cf Gal. 3:28).</p>
      <p> 31.  The passions lymg hidden in the soul provide the demons with the means of arousing impassioned droughts in us. Then, fighting the intellect through these thoughts, they force it to give its assent to sm. When it has been overcome, they lead it to sin in the mind; and when this has been done they induce it, captive as it is, to commit the sin in action. Having thus desolated the soul by means of these thoughts, the demons then retreat, taking the thoughts with them, and only the specter or idol of sin remains in the intellect. Referring to this our Lord says, 'When you see the abominable idol of desolation standing in the holy place (let him who reads understand). . .' (Matt. 24:15). For man's intellect is a holy place and a temple of God in which the demons, having desolated the soul by means of impassioned thoughts, set up the idol of sin. That these things have already taken place in history no one, I think.</p>
      <p> [V2] 71</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> who has read Josephus will doubt; though some say that they will also come to pass in the time of the Antichrist.</p>
      <p> 32. There are three things that impel us towards what is holy: natural instincts, angelic powers and probity of intention. Natural instincts impel us when, for example, we do to others what we would wish them to do to us (cf Luke 6:31), or when we see someone suffering deprivation or in need and naturally feel compassion. Angelic powers impel us when, being ourselves impelled to something worthwhile, we find we are providentially helped and guided. We are impelled by probity of intention when, discriminating between good and evil, we choose the good.</p>
      <p> 33.  There are also three things that impel us towards evil: passions, demons and sinfulness of intention. Passions impel us when, for example, we desire somethmg beyond what is reasonable, such as food which is unnecessary or untimely, or a woman who is not our wife or for a purpose other than procreation, or else when we are excessively angered or irritated by, for instance, someone who has dishonored or injured us. Demons impel us when, for example, they catch us off our guard and suddenly launch a violent attack upon us, stirring up the passions already mentioned and others of a similar nature. We are impelled by sinfulness of intention when, knowing the good, we choose evil instead.</p>
      <p> 34.  The rewards for the toils of virtue are dispassion and spiritual knowledge. For these are mediators of the kingdom of heaven, just as passions and ignorance are mediators of eternal punishment. It is because of this that he who seeks these rewards for the sake of human glory and not for their intrinsic goodness is rebuked by the words of Scripture, 'You ask, and do not receive, because you ask wrongly' (Jas. 4:3).</p>
      <p> 35.   Many human activities, good in themselves, are not good because of the motive for which they are done. For example, fasting and vigils, prayer and psalmody, acts of charity and hospitality are by nature good, but when performed for the sake of self-esteem they are not good.</p>
      <p> 36.  In everything that we do God searches out our purpose to see whether we do it for Him or for some other motive.</p>
      <p> 37.  When you hear the words of Scripture, "Thou shalt render to</p>
      <p> [V2] 72</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> every man according to his work' (Ps. 62:12. LXX), do not think that God bestows blessings when something is done for the wrong purpose, even though it seems be good. Quite clearly He bestows blessings only when something is done for the right purpose. For God's judgment looks not at the actions but at the purpose behind them.</p>
      <p> 38.  The malice of the demon of pride takes two forms. Either he persuades the monk to ascribe his achievements to</p>
      <p> himself and not to God, the Giver of aU goodness and helper in every achievement; or, if this fails, he suggests that he should belittle those of his brethren who are as yet less perfect than himself. Influenced in this way, he does not realize that the demon is persuading him to deny God's help. For if he belittles his brethren for their lack of achievement, he clearly infers that he has achieved something through his own powers. But this is impossible, since, as our Lord has said, 'Without Me you can do nothing' (John 15:5). For even when impelled towards what is good, our weakness cannot bring anything to fruition without the Giver of all goodness.</p>
      <p> 39.  The person who has come to know the weakness of human nature has gained experience of divine power. Such a man, having achieved some things and eager to achieve others through this divine power, never belittles anyone. For he knows that just as God has helped him and freed him from many passions and difficulties, so, when God wishes. He is able to help all men, especially those pursuing the spiritual way for His sake. And if in His providence He does not deliver all men together from their passions, yet like a good and loving physician He heals with individual treatment each of those who are trying to make progress.</p>
      <p> 40.  We grow proud when the passions cease to be active in us, and this whether they are inactive because their causes have been eradicated or because the demons have deliberately withdrawn in order to deceive us.</p>
      <p> 41.  Almost every sin is committed for the sake of sensual pleasure; and sensual pleasure is overcome by hardship and distress arising either voluntarily from repentance, or else involuntarily as a result of some salutary and providential reversal. "For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged; but when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, so that we should not be condemned with the world' (1 Cor. 11:31 -32).</p>
      <p> 42.  When a trial comes upon you unexpectedly, do not blame</p>
      <p> [V2] 73</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love Second Century</p>
      <p> the person through whom it came but try to discover the reason why it came, and then you will find a way of dealing with it. For whether through this person or through someone else you had in any case to drink the wormwood of God's judgments.</p>
      <p> 43.  As long as you have bad habits do not reject hardship, so that through it you may be humbled and eject your pride.</p>
      <p> 44. Sometimes men are tested by pleasure, sometimes by distress or by physical suffering. By means of His prescriptions the Physician of souls administers the remedy according to the cause of the passions lying hidden in the soul.</p>
      <p> 45.  Trials are sent to some so as to take away past sins, to others so as to eradicate sins now being committed, and to yet others so as to forestall sins which may be committed in the future. These are distinct from the trials that arise in order to test men in the way that Job was tested.</p>
      <p> 46.   The sensible man, taking into account the remedial effect of the divine prescriptions, gladly bears the sufferings which they bring upon him, since he is aware that they have no cause other than his own sin. But when the fool, ignorant of the supreme wisdom of God's providence, sins and is corrected, he regards either God or men as responsible for the hardships he suffers.</p>
      <p> 47.   Certain things stop the movement of the passions and do not allow them to grow; others subdue them and make them diminish. For instance, where desire is concerned, fasting, labor and vigils do not allow it to grow, while withdrawal, contemplation, prayer and intense longing for God subdue it and make it disappear. The same is true with regard to anger. Forbearance, freedom from rancor, gentleness, for example, all arrest it and prevent it from growing, while love, acts of charity, kindness and compassion make it diminish.</p>
      <p> 48.  When a man's intellect is constantly with God, his desire grows beyond all measure into an intense longing for God and his incensiveness is completely transformed into divine love. For by continual participation in the divine radiance his intellect becomes totally filled with light; and when it has reintegrated its passible aspect, it redirects this aspect towards God, as we have said, filling it with an incomprehensible and intense longing for Him and with unceasing love, thus drawing it entirely away from worldly things to the divine.</p>
      <p> [V2] 74</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> 49. If a man is not envious or angry, and does not bear a grudge against someone who has offended him, that does not necessarily mean that he loves him. For, while still lacking love, he may be capable of not repaying evil with evil, in accordance with the commandment (cf Rom. 12:17), and yet by no means be capable of rendering good for evil without forcing himself To be spontaneously disposed to 'do good to those who you hate you'</p>
      <p> (Matt. 5:44) belongs to perfect spiritual love alone.</p>
      <p> 50.  If a man does not love someone, it does not necessarily mean that he hates him: and conversely, if he does not hate him, it does not necessarily mean that he loves him, since he can be neutral towards him, that is, neither love him nor hate him. For the disposition to love is created only in the five ways listed in the ninth text of this Century, one commendable, one of an intermediate kind, and three reprehensible.</p>
      <p> 51.  When you find your intellect occupied pleasurably with material things and becoming fondly attached to its conceptual images of them, you may be sure that you love these things more than God. 'For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also' (Matt. 6:21).</p>
      <p> 52.  The intellect joined to God for long periods through prayer and love becomes wise, good, powerful, compassionate, merciful and long-suffering; in short, it includes within itself almost all the divine qualities. But when the intellect withdraws from God and attaches itself to material things, either it becomes self-indulgent like some domestic animal, or like a wild beast it fights with men for the sake of these things.</p>
      <p> 53.  Scripture calls material things 'the world": and worldly men are those who occupy their intellect with these things. It is such men that Scripture rebukes when it says: 'Do not love the world or the things that are in the world . . . The desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and pride in one's possessions, are not of God but of the world' (cf 1 John 2:15-16).</p>
      <p> 54.  A monk is a man who has freed his intellect from attachment to material things and by means of self-control, love, psalmody and prayer cleaves to God.</p>
      <p> 55.  The herdsman signifies the man practicing the virtues, for moral achievements may be represented by cattle. That is why Jacob said, 'Your servants are herdsmen' (Gen. 46:34). The</p>
      <p> [V2] 75</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love Second Century</p>
      <p> shepherd signifies the gnostic, for sheep represent thoughts pastured by the intellect on the mountains of contemplation. That is why 'every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians' (Gen. 46:34), that is, to the demonic powers.</p>
      <p> 56.  When the body is urged by the senses to indulge its own desires and pleasures, the corrupted intellect readily succumbs and assents to its impassioned fantasies and impulses. But the regenerated intellect exercises self-control and withholds itself from them. Moreover, as a true philosopher it studies how to rectify such impulses.</p>
      <p> 57.   There are virtues of the body and virtues of the soul. Those of the body include fasting, vigils, sleeping on the ground, ministering to people's needs, working with one's hands so as not to be a burden or in order to give to others (cf 1 Thess. 2:9, Ephes. 4:28). Those of the soul include love, long-suffering, gentleness, self-control and prayer (cf. Gal, 5:22). If as a result of some constraint or bodily condition, such as illness or the like, we find we cannot practice the bodily virtues mentioned above, we are forgiven by the Lord because He knows the reasons. But if we fail to practice the virtues of the soul, we shall not have a single excuse, for it is always within our power to practice them.</p>
      <p> 58.  Love for God leads him who shares in it to be indifferent to every transient pleasure and every labor and distress. Let all the saints, who have suffered joyfully so much for Christ, convince you of this.</p>
      <p> 59.  Guard yourself from that mother of vices, self-love, which is mindless love for the body. For it gives birth with specious justification to the three first and most general of the impassioned thoughts. I mean those of gluttony, avarice and self-esteem, which take as their pretext some so-called need of the body. All further vices are generated by these three. You must therefore be on your guard, as we have already said, and fight against self-love with great vigilance. For when this vice is eradicated, all the others are eradicated too.</p>
      <p> 60.   The passion of self-love suggests to the monk that he should have pity on his body and in the name of its proper care and governance should take food more often than is fitting; for in this way self-love will lead him on step by step to fall into the pit of self-indulgence. On the other hand, self-love prompts those who are not monks to fulfill the body's desires at once.</p>
      <p> [V2] 76</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> 61. It is said that the highest state of prayer is reached when the intellect goes beyond the flesh and the World, and while praying is utterly free from matter and form. He who maintains this state has truly attained unceasing prayer.</p>
      <p> 62.   When the body dies, it is whoUy separated from the things of this world. Similarly, when the intellect dies while in that supreme state of prayer, it is separated from all conceptual images of this world. If it does not die such a death, it cannot be with God and live with Him.</p>
      <p> 63.   Let no one deceive you, monk, with the notion that you can be saved while a slave to sensual pleasure and self-esteem.</p>
      <p> 64.  When the body sins through material things, it has the bodily virtues to teach it self-restraint. Similarly, when the intellect sins through impassioned conceptual images, it has the virtues of the soul to instruct it, so that by seeing things in a pure and dispassionate way, it too may learn self-restraint.</p>
      <p> 65.  Just as night follows day and winter summer, so distress and pain follow self-esteem and sensual pleasure, either in this life or after death.</p>
      <p> 66.  No sinner can escape future judgment without experiencing in this life either voluntary hardships or afflictions he has not chosen.</p>
      <p> 67.  There are said to be five reasons why God allows us to be assailed by demons. The first is so that, by attacking and counterattacking, we should learn to discriminate between virtue and vice. The second is so that, having acquired virtue through conflict and toil, we should keep it secure and immutable. The third is so that, when making progress in virtue, we should not become haughty but learn humility. The fourth is so that, having gained some experience of evil, we should 'hate it with perfect hatred' (cf Ps. 139:22). The fifth and most important is so that, having achieved dispassion, we should forget neither our own weakness nor the power of Him who has helped us.</p>
      <p> 68.   Just as the intellect of a hungry man imagines bread and that of a thirsty man water, so the intellect of a glutton imagines a profusion of foods, that of a sensualist the forms of women, that of a vain man worldly honor, that of an avaricious man financial gain, that of a rancorous man revenge on whoever has offended him, that of an envious man how to harm the object of his envy, and so on with all the other passions. For an intellect agitated by passions is beset by</p>
      <p> [V2] 77</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love Second Century</p>
      <p> impassioned conceptual images whether the body is awake or asleep.</p>
      <p> 69. When desire grows strong, the intellect in sleep imagines things that give sensual pleasure; and when the incensive power grows strong, it imagines things that cause fear. For the impure demons, finding an ally m our negligence, strengthen and excite the passions. But holy angels, by inducing us to perform works of virtue, make them weaker.</p>
      <p> 70.  When the desiring aspect of the soul is frequently excited, it implants in the soul a habit of self-indulgence which is difficult to break. When the soul's incensive power is constantly stimulated, it becomes in the end cowardly and unmanly. The first of these failings is cured by long exercise in fasting, vigils and prayer; the second by kindness, compassion, love and mercy.</p>
      <p> 71.   The demons fight against us either through things themselves or through our impassioned conceptual images of these things. They fight through things against those who are occupied with things and through conceptual images against those who are not attached to things.</p>
      <p> 72.  Just as it is easier to sin in the mind than in action, so warfare through our impassioned conceptual images of things is harder than warfare through the things themselves,</p>
      <p> 73.  Things are outside the intellect, but the conceptual images of these things are formed within it. It is consequently in the intellect's power to make good or bad use of these conceptual images. Their wrong use is followed by the misuse of the things themselves.</p>
      <p> 74.  The intellect receives impassioned conceptual images in three ways: through the senses, through the body's condition and through the memory. It receives them through the senses when the senses themseh'es receive impressions from things in relation to which we have acquired passion, and when these things stir up impassioned thoughts in the intellect; through the body's condition when, as a result either of an undisciplined way of life, or of the activity of demons, or of some illness, the balance of elements in the body is disturbed and again the intellect is stirred to impassioned thoughts or to thoughts contrary to providence; through the memory when the memory recalls the conceptual images of things in relation to which we were once made passionate, and so stirs up impassioned thoughts in a similar way.</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> 75.   Some of the things given to us by God for our use are in the soul, others are in the body and others relate to the body. In the soul are its powers: in the body are the sense organs and other members; relating to the body are food, money, possessions and so on. Our good or bad use of these things given us by God, or of what is contingent upon them, reveals whether we are virtuous or evil.</p>
      <p> 76.  Of the things contingent upon those given us by God, some are in the soul, some are in the body, and some relate to the body. Those in the soul are spiritual knowledge and ignorance, forgetful-ness and memory, love and hate, fear and courage, distress and joy, and so on. Those in the body are pleasure and pain, sensation and numbness, health and disease, life and death, and so on. Those relating to the body are having children and not having children, wealth and poverty, fame and obscurity, and so on. Some of these are regarded as good and others as evil. Not one of them is evil in itself. According to how they are used they may rightly be called good or evil.</p>
      <p> 77.   Both spiritual knowledge and health are good by nature, yet their contraries have been of more benefit to many people. For such knowledge may serve no good purpose where the wicked are concerned, even though, as we have said, it is good in itself The same is true with regard to health, riches and joy, for they are not used advantageously by such people. But certainly their contraries do benefit them. Therefore not one of them is evil in itself, even though it may appear to be evil.</p>
      <p> 78.  Do not misuse your conceptual images of things, lest you are forced to make a wrong use of the things themselves. For if a man does not first sin in his mind, he will never sin in action.</p>
      <p> 79.  The principal vices - stupidity, cowardice, licentiousness, injustice - are the 'image' of the 'earthy' man. The principal virtues - intelligence, courage, self-restramt, justice - are the 'image' of the 'heavenly' man. As we have borne the image of the earthy, let us also bear the image of the heavenly (cf 1 Cor. 15:49).</p>
      <p> 80.  If you wish to find the way that leads to life, look for it in the Way who says, "I am the way, the door, the truth and the life' (John 10:7: 14:6), and there you will find it. Only let your search be diligent and painstaking, for 'few there are that find it" (Matt. 7:14) and if you are not among the few you will find yourself with the many.</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> 81, Five things make a soul cut itself off from sin: fear of judgment, hope of future reward, love of God and, lastly, the prompting of conscience.</p>
      <p> 82.  Some say that there would be no evil in the created world unless there were some power outside this world dragging us towards evil. But this so-called power is in fact our neglect of the natural energies of the intellect. For those who nurture these energies always do good, never evil. If this, then, is what you too wish to do, get rid of negligence and you will also drive out evil, which is the wrong use of our conceptual images of things, followed by the wrong use of the things themselves.</p>
      <p> 83.  In its natural state, the human intelligence is subject to the divine intelligence and itself rules over the non-intelligent element in us. Let this order be maintained in all things, and there will be no evil among creatures nor anything which draws us towards evil.</p>
      <p> 84.  Some thoughts are simple, others are composite. Thoughts which are not impassioned are simple. Passion-charged thoughts are composite, consisting as they do of a conceptual image combined with passion. This being so, when composite thoughts begin to provoke a sinful idea in the mind, many simple thoughts may be seen to follow them. For instance, an impassioned thought about gold rises in someone's mind. He has the urge mentally to steal the gold and commits the sin in his intellect. Then thoughts of the purse, the chest, the room and so on follow hard on the thought of the gold. The thought of the gold was composite - for it was combined with passion - but those of the purse, the chest and so on were simple: for the intellect had no passion in relation to these things. And the same is true for every thought - thoughts of self-esteem, women and so on. For not all thoughts which follow impassioned thought are themselves impassioned, as our example has shown. From this, then, we may know which conceptual images are impassioned and which are not.</p>
      <p> 85.  Some say that the demons first touch the genitals during sleep and so arouse the passion of unchastity. Once aroused, the passion, by means of the memory, brings the form of a woman into the intellect. But others say that the demons appear first to the intellect in the guise of a woman and then excite the appetite by touching the genitals and so fantasies arise. Yet others say that the passion dominant in the approaching demon stirs the corresponding</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> passion m us, and thus the soul is incited to sinful thoughts and brings these female forms mto the intellect by means of the memory. The same is true with regard to other impassioned fantasies. Some say they happen in one way, others in another. However, if love and self-control are present in the soul, the demons have no power to arouse any passion at all in any of the ways described, whether the body is awake or asleep.</p>
      <p> 86.  Some commandments of the Mosaic Law must be kept both physically and spiritually, others only spiritually. For example, 'You shall not commit adultery, you shall not kill, you shall not steal' (Exod. 20:13-15) and so on must be kept both physically and spiritually (the spiritual observance is threefold, as explained below). To be circumcised (cf Lev. 12: 3), to keep the Sabbath (cf Exod. 31:13), and to slaughter the lamb and eat unleavened bread with bitter herbs (cf Exod. 12:8; 23:15) and similar injunctions are to be kept only spiritually.</p>
      <p> 87.   There are three main inner states characterizing the life of the monk. The first consists in not sinning in actions; the second in not allowing the soul to dally with impassioned thoughts; the third in being able to contemplate dispassionately in the mind the forms of women and of those who have given one offence.</p>
      <p> 88.  A man who is truly without possessions is one who has renounced all his worldly goods and has absolutely nothing on earth except his body; and who, breaking his attachment to the body, has entrusted himself to the care of God and of the devout.</p>
      <p> 89.  Some people with possessions possess them dispassionately, and so when deprived of them they are not dismayed but are like those who accepted the seizure of their goods with joy (cf. Heb. 10:34). Others possess with passion, so that when they are in danger of being dispossessed they become utterly dejected, like the rich man in the Gospel who went away full of sorrow (cf. Matt. 19:22); and if they actually are dispossessed, they remain dejected until they die. Dispossession, then, reveals whether a man's inner state is dispassionate or dominated by passion.</p>
      <p> 90.  The demons attack the person who has attained the summits of prayer in order to prevent his conceptual images of sensible things from bemg free from passion; they attack the gnostic so that he will dally with impassioned thoughts; and they attack the person who has not advanced beyond the practice of the virtues so as to persuade</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> him to sin through his actions.. They contend with aU men by every possible means in order to separate them from God.</p>
      <p> 91.   Those whom divine providence is leading towards holiness in this life are tested by the following three tests: by the gift of agreeable things, such as health, beauty, fine children, money, fame and so on; by afflictions causing distress, such as the loss of children, money and fame: and by bodily sufferings, such as disease, torture and so on. To those in the first category the Lord says, "If a person does not forsake all that he has, he cannot be My disciple" (Luke 14:33); and to those in the second and third He says, "You will gain possession of your souls through your patient endurance" (Luke 21: 19).</p>
      <p> 92.  The following four things are said to change the body's temperament and through it to produce either impassioned or dispassionate thoughts in the intellect: angels, demons, the winds and diet. It is said that angels change it by thought, demons by touch, the winds by varying, and diet by the quality of our food and drink and by whether we eat too much or too little. There are also changes brought about by means of memory, hearing and sight - namely when the soul is affected by joyful or distressing experiences as a result of one of these three means, and then changes the body's temperament. Thus changed, this temperament in its turn induces corresponding thoughts in the intellect.</p>
      <p> 93.  Death in the true sense is separation from God, and "the sting of death is sin" (1 Cor. 15:56). Adam, who received the sting, became at the same time an exile from the tree of life, from paradise and from God (cf Gen. 3); and this was necessarily followed by the body's death. Life, in the true sense, is He who said, "1 am the life' (John 11:25), and who, having entered into death, led back to life him who had died.</p>
      <p> 94.  A man writes either to assist his memory, or to help others, or for both reasons; or else he writes in order to injure certain people, or to show off, or out of necessity.</p>
      <p> 95.  In Psalm 23, 'green pasture' represents the practice of the virtues; 'water of refreshment", spiritual knowledge of created things.</p>
      <p> 96.   'The shadow of death' is human hfe. Therefore if a man is with God and God is with him, clearly he is able to say, "Though I walk through the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me'.</p>
      <p> [V2] 82</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> 97.  A pure intellect sees things correctly. A trained intelligence puts them in order. A keen hearing takes in what is said. He who is lacking in these three qualities insults the person who has spoken.</p>
      <p> 98.  He who knows the Holy Trinity, the Trinity's creation, and providence, and who has brought his soul's passible aspect into a state of dispassion, is with God.</p>
      <p> 99.  Again in Psalm 23 'the rod" is said to signify God's judgment and 'the staff His providence. So he who has received spiritual knowledge of these things is able to say, "Thy rod and Thy staff have comforted me.'</p>
      <p> 100.  When the intellect is stripped of passions and illuminated with the contemplation of created beings, then it can enter into God and pray as it should.</p>
      <p> [V2] 83</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love Third Century</p>
      <p> 1.  An intelligent use of conceptual images and their corresponding physical objects produces self-restraint, love and spiritual knowledge; an unintelligent use produces licentiousness, hatred and ignorance.</p>
      <p> 2.  "You have prepared a table before me . . .' (Ps. 23:5). In this passage, "table' stands for the practice of the virtues, for this has been prepared for us by Christ to use 'against those who afflict' us. The 'oil' anointing the intellect is the contemplation of created things. The 'cup' of God is the knowledge of God. His "mercy'</p>
      <p> is His divine Logos. For through His incarnation the Logos pursues us 'all the days' until He overtakes all those who are to be saved, as He did in the case of Paul (cf. Phil. 3:12). The "house" is the kingdom in which all the saints will dwell. "Length of days' means eternal life.</p>
      <p> 3.  When we misuse the soul's powers their evil aspects dominate us. For instance, misuse of our power of intelligence results in ignorance and stupidity; misuse of our mcensive power and of our desire produces hatred and licentiousness. The proper use of these powers produces spiritual knowledge, moral judgment, love and self-restraint. This being so, nothing created and given existence by God is evil.</p>
      <p> 4.  It is not food that is evil but gluttony, not the begetting of children but unchastity, not material things but avarice, not esteem but self-esteem. This being so, it is only the misuse of things that is evil, and such misuse occurs when the intellect fails to cultivate its natural powers.</p>
      <p> 5.  Among the demons, says the blessed Dionysios, evil takes the form of mindless anger, desire uncontrolled by the intellect, and</p>

      <p> impetuous imagination. But mindlessness, lack of intellectual control and impetuosity in intelligent beings are privations of intelligence, intellect and circumspection. But a privation is posterior to the possession of something. There was a time, then, when the demons possessed intelligence, intellect and devout circumspection. This being the case, not even the demons are evil by nature, but they have become evil through the misuse of their natural powers.</p>
      <p> 6.    Some of the passions produce licentiousness, some hatred, while others produce both dissipation and hatred.</p>
      <p> 7.  Overeating and gluttony cause licentiousness. Avarice and self-esteem cause one to hate one's neighbor. Self-love, the mother of vices, is the cause of all these things.</p>
      <p> 8.  Self-love is an impassioned, mindless love for one's body. Its opposite is love and self-control. A man dominated by self-love is dominated by all the passions.</p>
      <p> 9.  'No man has ever hated his own flesh', says the Apostle (Eph. 5:29), but he disciplines it and makes it his servant (cf. 1 Cor. 9:27), allowing it nothing but food and clothing (cf. 1 Tim. 6:8), and then only what Is necessary for life. In this way a man loves his flesh dispassionately and nourishes it and cares for it as a servant of divine things, supplying it only with what meets its basic needs.</p>
      <p> 10.  If a man loves someone, he naturally makes every effort to be of service to that person. If, then, a man loves God, he naturally strives to conform to His will. But if he loves the flesh, he panders to the flesh.</p>
      <p> 11.  Love, self-restraint, contemplation and prayer accord with God's will, while gluttony, licentiousness and things that increase them pander to the flesh. That is why "they that are in the flesh cannot conform to God's will' (Rom. 8:8). But "they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh together with the passions and desires' (Gal. 5:24).</p>
      <p> 12.  If the intellect inclines to God, it treats the body as its servant and provides it with no more than it needs to sustain life. But if it inclines to the flesh, it becomes the servant of the passions and is always thinking about how to fulfill its desires.</p>
      <p> 13. If you wish to master your thoughts, concentrate on the passions and you will easily drive the thoughts arising from them out of your intellect. With regard to unchastity, for instance, fast and keep vigils, labor and avoid meeting people. With regard to anger</p>
      <p> [V2] 85</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> and resentment, be indifferent to fame, dishonor and material things. With regard to rancor, pray for him who has offended you and you will be delivered.</p>
      <p> 14. Do not compare yourself with weaker men but rather apply yourself to fulfilling the commandment of love. For by comparing yourself with the weak you will fall into the pit of conceit, but by applying yourself to the commandment of love you will reach the height of humility.</p>
      <p> 15.  It you totally fulfill the command to love your neighbor, you will feel no bitterness or resentment against him whatever he does. If this is not the case, then the reason why you fight against your brother is clearly because you seek after transitory things and prefer them to the commandment of love.</p>
      <p> 16.  It is not so much because of need that gold has become an object of desire among men, as because of the power it gives most people to indulge in sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> 17.   There are three things which produce love of material wealth: self-indulgence, self-esteem and lack of faith. Lack of faith is more dangerous than the other two.</p>
      <p> 18.  The self-indulgent person loves wealth because it enables him to live comfortably; the person full of self-esteem loves it because through it he can gain the esteem of others: the person who lacks faith loves it because, fearful of starvation, old age, disease, or exile, he can save it and hoard it. He puts his trust in wealth rather than in God, the Creator who provides for all creation, down to the least of living things.</p>
      <p> 19.  There are four kinds of men who hoard wealth: the three already mentioned and the treasurer or bursar. Clearly, it is only the last who conserves it for a good purpose - namely, so as always to have the means of supplying each person's basic needs.</p>
      <p> 20.  All impassioned thoughts either stimulate the soul's desiring power, or disturb its incensive power, or darken its intelligence. It is in this way that the intellect's capacity for spiritual contemplation and for the ecstasy of prayer is dulled. And for this reason a monk, especially the hesychast, must pay close attention to such thoughts, searching out and eliminating their causes. For example, the soul's power of desire is stimulated by impassioned thoughts of women. Such thoughts are caused by intemperance in eating and drinking, and by frequent and senseless talk with the women in question; and</p>
      <p> [V2] 86</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> they are cut off by hunger, thirst, vigils and withdrawal from human society. Again, the incensive power is disturbed by impassioned thoughts about those who have offended us. This is caused by self-indulgence, self-esteem and love</p>
      <p> of material things. For it is on account of such vices that the passion-dominated man feels resentment, being frustrated or otherwise failmg to attain what he wants. These thoughts are cut off when the vices provoking them are rejected .and nullified through the love of God.</p>
      <p> 21.   God knows Himself and He knows the things He has created. The angelic powers, too, know God and know the things He has created. But they do not know God and the things He has created in the same way that God knows Himself and the things He has created.</p>
      <p> 22.  God knows Himself through knowing His blessed essence. And the things created by Him He knows through knowing His wisdom, by means of which and in which He made all things. But the angelic powers know God by participation, though God Himself transcends such participation; and the things He has created they know by apprehending that which may be spiritually contemplated m them.</p>
      <p> 23.  Although the intellect apprehends its vision of created things within itself, they are actually outside it. This is not the case with respect to God's knowledge of Created things, for He is eternal, infinite and undetermined, and has bestowed on everything that exists its being, well-being and eternal being.</p>
      <p> 24.  Natures endowed with intelligence and intellect participate in God through their very being, through their capacity for well-being, that is for goodness and wisdom, and through the grace that gives them eternal being. This, then, is how they know God. They know God's creation, as we have said, by apprehending the harmonious wisdom to be contemplated in it. This wisdom is apprehended by the intellect in a non-material way, and has no independent existence of its own.</p>
      <p> 25.   When God brought into being natures endowed with intelligence and intellect He communicated to them, in His supreme goodness, four of the divine attributes by which He sustains, protects and preserves created things. These attributes are being, eternal being, goodness and wisdom. Of the four He granted the first two, being and eternal being, to their essence, and the second two, goodness and wisdom, to their volitive faculty, so that what He is in</p>
      <p> [V2] 87</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love Third Century</p>
      <p> His essence the creature may become by participation. This is why man is said to have been created in the image and hkeness of God (cf Gen. 1:26). He is made in the image of God, since his being is in the image of God's being, and his eternal being is in the image of God's eternal being (in the sense that, though not without origin, it is nevertheless without end). He is also made in the likeness of God, since he is good in the likeness of God's goodness, and wise in the likeness of God's wisdom, God being good and wise by nature, and man by grace. Every intelligent nature is in the image of God, but only the good and the wise attain His likeness.</p>
      <p> 26.  All beings endowed with intelligence and intellect are either angelic or human. All angelic beings may be subdivided further into two general moral categories or classes, the holy and the accursed — that is, the holy powers and the impure demons. All human beings may also be divided into two moral categories only, the godly and the ungodly.</p>
      <p> 27.   Since God is absolute existence, absolute goodness and absolute wisdom, or rather, to put it more exactly, since God is beyond all such things, there is nothing whatsoever that is opposite to Him. Creatures, on the other hand, all exist through participation and grace, while those endowed with intelligence and intellect also have a capacity for goodness and wisdom. Hence they do have opposites. As the opposite to existence they have nonexistence, and as the opposite to the capacity for goodness and wisdom they have evil and ignorance. Whether or not they are to exist eternally lies Within the power of their Maker. But whether or not intelligent creatures are to participate in His goodness and wisdom depends on their own will.</p>
      <p> 28.   The ancient Greek philosophers say that the being of created things has coexisted with God from all eternity and that God has only given it its qualities. They say that this being itself has no opposite, and that opposition lies only in the qualities. But we maintain that only the divine essence has no opposite, since it is eternal and infinite and bestows eternity on other things. The being of created things, on the other hand, has non-being as its opposite. Whether or not it exists eternally depends on the power of Him who alone exists in a substantive sense. But since 'the gifts of God are irrevocable" (Rom. 11:29), the being of created things always is and always will be sustained by His almighty power, even though it</p>
      <p> [V2] 88</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love Third Century</p>
      <p> has, as we said, an opposite; for it has been brought into being from non-being, and whether or not it exists depends on the wiU of God.</p>
      <p> 29.   Just as evil is a privation of good, and ignorance a privation of knowledge, so non-being is a privation of being -not of being in a substantive sense, for that does not have any opposite, but of being that exists by participation in substantive being. The first two privations mentioned depend on the will of creatures; the third lies in the will of the Maker, who in His goodness wills beings always to exist and always to receive His blessings.</p>
      <p> 30.  All creatures are either endowed with intelligence and intellect, and thus possess a capacity for opposites such as virtue and vice, knowledge and ignorance; or else they are physical bodies of various kinds made up of opposites, that is, of earth, air, fire and water. The former are altogether incorporeal and immaterial, although some of them are joined to bodies; the latter are composed of matter and form.</p>
      <p> 31.  By nature all bodies lack a capacity for motion; they are given motion by the soul, either by one that is intelligent, or by one without intelligence, or by one that is insensate, as the case may be.</p>
      <p> 32.   The soul has three powers: first, the power of nourishment and growth; second, that of imagination and instinct; third, that of intelligence and intellect. Plants share only in the first of these powers; animals share in the first and second; men share in all three. The first two powers are perishable; the third is clearly imperishable and immortal.</p>
      <p> 33.  In communicating illumination to each other, the angelic powers also communicate either their virtue or their knowledge to human nature. As regards their virtue, they communicate a goodness which imitates the goodness of God, and through this goodness they confer blessings on themselves, on one another and on their inferiors, thus making them like God. As regards their knowledge, they communicate either a more sublime knowledge about God - for, as Scripture says, 'Thou, Lord, art most high for evermore' (Ps. 92:8) - or a more profound knowledge about embodied beings, or one that is more exact about incorporeal beings, or more distinct about divine providence, or more precise about divine judgment.</p>
      <p> 34.  Impurity of intellect consists first in having false knowledge;</p>
      <p> secondly in being ignorant of any of the universals (I refer to the human intellect, for it is a property of the angelic intellect not to be</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> ignorant even of particulars): thirdly in having impassioned thoughts: and fourthly in assenting to sin.</p>
      <p> 35.  Impurity of soul lies in its not functioning in accordance with nature. It is because of this that impassioned thoughts are produced in the intellect. The soul functions in accordance with nature when its passible aspects -that is, its incensive power and its desire - remain dispassionate in the face of provocations both from things and from the conceptual images of these things.</p>
      <p> 36.  Impurity of body consists in the actual committing of sin.</p>
      <p> 37.  He who is not attracted by worldly things cherishes stillness. He who loves nothing merely human loves all men. And he who takes no offence at anyone either on account of their faults, or on account of his own suspicious thoughts, has knowledge of God and of things divine.</p>
      <p> 38.   It is a great achievement not to be attracted by things. But it is a far greater achievement to remain dispassionate in the face both of things and of the conceptual images we derive from them.</p>
      <p> 39.   Love and self-control keep the intellect dispassionate in the face both of things and of the conceptual images we form of them.</p>
      <p> 40.   The intellect of a man who enjoys the love of God does not fight against things or against conceptual images of them. It battles against the passions which are linked with these images. It does not, for example, fight against a woman, or against a man who has offended it, or even against the images it forms of them: but it fights against the passions which are linked with the images.</p>
      <p> 41.  The whole purpose of the monk's warfare against the demons is to separate the passions from conceptual images. Otherwise he will not be able to look on things dispassionately.</p>
      <p> 42.  A thing, a conceptual image and a passion are all quite different one from the other. For example, a man, a woman, gold and so forth are things: a conceptual image is a passion-free thought of one of these things: a</p>
      <p> passion is mindless affection or indiscriminate hatred for one of these same things. The monk's battle is therefore against passion.</p>
      <p> 43. An impassioned conceptual image is a thought compounded of passion and a conceptual image. If we separate the passion from the conceptual image, what remains is the passion-free thought. We can make this separation by means of spiritual love and self-control, if only we have the will.</p>
      <p> [V2] 90</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> 44.  The virtues separate the intellect from the passions; spiritual contemplation separates it from its passion-free conceptual images of things: pure prayer brings it into the presence of God Himself.</p>
      <p> 45.  The virtues exist for the sake of the knowledge of creatures;</p>
      <p> knowledge for the sake of the knower; the knower, for the sake of Him who is known through unknowing and who knows beyond all knowledge.</p>
      <p> 46.   God, full beyond all fullness, brought creatures into being not because He had need of anything, but so that they might participate in Him in proportion to their capacity and that He Himself might rejoice in His works (cf Ps. 104:31), through seeing them joyful and ever filled to overflowing with His inexhaustible gifts.</p>
      <p> 47.  There are many people in the world who are poor in spirit, but not in the way that they should be: there are many who mourn, but for some financial loss or the death of their children: many are gentle, but towards unclean passions: many hunger and thirst, but only to seize what does not belong to them and to profit from injustice : many are merciful, but towards their bodies and the things that serve the body: many are pure in heart, but for the sake of self-esteem; many are peace-makers, but by making the soul submit to the flesh: many are persecuted, but as wrongdoers: many are reviled, but for shameful sins. Only those are blessed who do or suffer these things for the sake of Christ and after His example. Why? Because theirs is the kingdom of heaven, and they shall see God (cf. Matt. 5:3-12). It is not because they do or suffer these things that they are blessed, for those of whom we have spoken above do the same; it is because they do them and suffer them for the sake of</p>
      <p> Christ and after His example.</p>
      <p> 48.  As has been said many times, in everything we do God examines our motive, to see whether we are doing it for His sake or for some other purpose. Thus when we desire to do something good, we should not do it for the sake of popularity: we should have God as our goal, so that, with our gaze always fixed on Him, we may do everything for His sake. Otherwise we shall undergo all the trouble of performing the act and yet lose the reward.</p>
      <p> 49.  In time of prayer clear your intellect of both the passion-free conceptual images of human things and the contemplation of creatures. Otherwise in imagining lesser things you may fall away from Him who is incomparably greater than all created beings.</p>
      <p> [V2] 91</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> 50.  Through genuine love for God we can drive out the passions. Love for God is this: to choose Him rather than the world, and the soul rather than the flesh, by despising the things of this world and by devoting ourselves constantly to Him through self-control, love, prayer, psalmody and so on.</p>
      <p> 51.  If we persistently devote ourselves to God and keep a careful watch on the soul's passible aspect, we are no longer driven headlong by the provocations of our thoughts. On the contrary, as we acquire a more exact understanding of their causes and cut them off, we become more discerning. In this way the following words come to apply to us: "My eye also sees my enemies, and my ear shall hear the wicked that rise up against me' (Ps. 92:11. LXX).</p>
      <p> 52.  When you see that your intellect reflects upon its conceptual images of the world with reverence and justice, you may be sure that your body, too, continues to be pure and sinless. But when you see that your intellect is occupied with thoughts of sin, and you do not check it, you may be sure that before very long your body, too, will fall into those sins.</p>
      <p> 53. As the world of the body consists of things, so the world of the intellect consists of conceptual images. And as</p>
      <p> the body fornicates with the body of a woman, so the inteUect, forming a picture of its own body, fornicates with the conceptual image of a woman. For in the mind it sees the form of its own body having intercourse with the form of a woman. Similarly, through the form of its own body, it mentally attacks the form of someone who has given it offence. The same is true with respect to other sins. For what the body acts out in the world of things, the intellect also acts out in the world of conceptual images.</p>
      <p> 54. One should not be startled or astonished because God the Father judges no one but has given all judgment to the Son (cf John 5:22). The Son teaches us, "Do not judge, so that you may not be judged' (Matt. 7:1); 'Do not condemn, so that you may not be condemned' (Luke 6:37). St Paul likewise says, 'Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes' (1 Cor. 4:5); and 'By judging another you condemn yourself (Rom. 2:1). But men have given up weeping for their own sins and have taken judgment away from the Son. They themselves judge and condemn one another as if they were sinless. "Heaven was amazed at this' (Jer. 2:12. LXX) and earth shuddered, but men in their obduracy are not ashamed.</p>
      <p> [V2] 92</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love Third Century</p>
      <p> 55.  He who busies himself with the sins of others, or judges his brother on suspicion, has not yet even begun to repent or to examine himself so as to discover his own sins, which are truly heavier than a great lump of lead; nor does he know why a man becomes heavy-hearted when he loves vanity and chases after falsehood (cf Ps. 4:1). That is why, like a fool who walks in darkness, he no longer attends to his own sins but lets his imagination dwell on the sins of others, whether these sins are real or merely the products of his own suspicious mind.</p>
      <p> 56.  Self-love, as has often been said, is the cause of all impassioned thoughts. For from it are produced the three principal thoughts of desire; those of gluttony, avarice and self-esteem. From gluttony is bom the thought of unchastity; from avarice, the thought of greed; from self-esteem, the thought of pride. All the rest - the thoughts of anger, resentment, rancor, listlessness, envy, backbiting and so on - are consequent upon one or other of these three. These passions, then, tie the intellect to material things and drag it down to earth, pressing on it like a massive stone, although by nature it is lighter and swifter than fire.</p>
      <p> 57.   The origin of all the passions is self-love; their consummation is pride. Self-love is a mindless love for the body. He who cuts this off cuts off at the same time all the passions that come from it.</p>
      <p> 58.  Just as parents have a special affection for the children who are the fruit of their own bodies, so the intellect naturally clings to its own thoughts. And just as to passionately fond parents their own children seem the most capable and most beautiful of all - though they may be quite the most ridiculous in every way - so to a foolish intellect its own thoughts appear the most intelligent of all, though they may be utterly degraded. The wise man does not regard his own thoughts in this way. It is precisely when he feels convinced that they are true and good that he most distrasts his own judgment. He makes other wise men the judges of his thoughts and arguments -lest he should ran, or may have ran, in vain (cf. Gal. 2:2) - and from them receives assurance.</p>
      <p> 59.   When you overcome one of the grosser passions, such as gluttony, unchastity, anger or greed, the thought of self-esteem at once assails you. If you defeat this thought, the thought of pride succeeds it.</p>
      <p> [V2] 93</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> 60.  All the gross passions that dominate the soul drive from it the thought of self-esteem. But when all these passions have been defeated, they leave self-esteem free to take control.</p>
      <p> 61.   Self-esteem, whether it is eradicated or whether it remains, begets pride. When it is eradicated, it generates self-conceit; when it remains, it produces boastfulness.</p>
      <p> 62.  Self-esteem is eradicated by the hidden practice of the virtues, pride, by ascribing our achievements to God.</p>
      <p> 63.  He who has been granted knowledge of God, and fully enjoys the pleasure that comes from it, despises all the pleasures produced by the soul's desiring power.</p>
      <p> 64.   He who desires earthly things desires either food, or things which satisfy his sexual appetite, or human fame, or wealth, or some other thing consequent upon these. Unless the intellect finds something more noble to which it may transfer its desire, it will not be persuaded to scorn these things completely. The knowledge of God and of divine things is incomparably more noble than these earthly things.</p>
      <p> 66.   Passion-free knowledge of divine things does not persuade the intellect to scorn material things completely; it is like the passion-free thought of a sensible thing. It is therefore possible to find many men who have much knowledge and yet wallow in the passions of the flesh like pigs in the mire. Through their diligence they temporarily cleanse themselves and attain knowledge, but then they grow negligent. In this they resemble Saul: for Saul was granted the kingdom, but conducted himself unworthily and was driven out with terrible wrath (cf. 1 Sam. 10-15).</p>
      <p> 67.   Just as passion-free thought of human things does not compel the intellect to scorn divine things, so passion-free knowledge of divine things does not fully persuade it to scorn human things. For in this world truth exists in shadows and conjectures. That is why there is need for the blessed passion of holy love, which binds the intellect to spiritual contemplation and persuades it to prefer what is immaterial to what is material, and what is intelligible and divine to what is apprehended by the senses.</p>
      <p> 68.  If a man has cut off the passions and so has freed his thoughts from passion, it does not necessarily mean that his thoughts are</p>
      <p> [V2] 94</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> already orientated towards the divine. It may be that he feels no passionate attraction either for human or for divine things. This occurs in the case of those simply living the life of ascetic practice without yet having been granted spiritual knowledge. Such men keep the passions at bay either by fear of punishment or by hope of the kingdom.</p>
      <p> 69.  'We walk by faith, not by sight" (2 Cor. 5:7) and we gain spiritual knowledge through symbols, indistinctly as in a mirror (cf 1 Cor. 13:12). Thus we must devote much time to this kind of knowledge, so that by long study and constant application we may achieve a persistent state of contemplation.</p>
      <p> 70.   If we cut off the causes of the passions for only a short while, and occupy ourselves with spiritual contemplation without making it our sole and constant concern, we easily revert to the passions of the flesh, gaining nothing from our labor but theoretical knowledge coupled with conceit. The result is a gradual darkening of this knowledge itself and a complete turning of the intellect towards material things.</p>
      <p> 71.  The passion of love, when reprehensible, occupies the intellect with material things, but when rightly directed unites it with the divine. For the intellect tends to develop its powers among those things to which it devotes its attention; and where it develops its powers, there it will direct its desire and love. It will direct them, that is to say, either to what is divine, intelligible and proper to its nature, or to the passions and things of the flesh.</p>
      <p> 72.  God created both the invisible and the visible worlds, and so He obviously also made both the soul and the body. If the visible world is so beautiful, what must the invisible world be like? And if the invisible world is superior to the visible world, how much superior to both is God their Creator? If, then, the Creator of everything that is beautiful is superior to all His creation, on what grounds does the intellect abandon what is superior to all and engross itself in what is worst of all - I mean the passions of the flesh? Clearly this happens because the intellect has lived with these passions and grown accustomed to them since birth, whereas it has not yet had perfect experience of Him who is superior to all and beyond all things. Thus, if we gradually wean the intellect away from this relationship by long practice of controlling our indulgence in pleasure and by persistent meditation on divine realities, the</p>
      <p> [V2] 95</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love Third Century</p>
      <p> intellect will gradually devote itself more and more to these realities, will recognize its own dignity, and finally transfer all its desire to the divine.</p>
      <p> 73.  He who speaks dispassionately of his brother's sins does so either to correct him or to benefit another. If he speaks for any other reason, either to the brother himself or to another person, he speaks to abuse him or ridicule him. In this case he will not escape being abandoned by God. On the contrary, he will fall into the same sin or other sins and, censured and reproached by other men, will be put to shame.</p>
      <p> 74.  It is not always for the same reason that sinners commit the same sin. The reasons vary. For example, it is one thing to sin through force of habit and another to sin through being carried away by a sudden impulse. In the latter case the man did not deliberately choose the sin either before committing it, or afterwards: on the contrary, he is deeply distressed that the sin has occurred. It is quite different with the man who sins through force of habit. Prior to the act itself he was already sinning in thought, and after it he is still in the same state of mind.</p>
      <p> reason. Such a man plainly does not do anything or discuss anything for the edification of others. On the contrary, he always seeks the praise of those who see him or hear him. His passion is brought to light when some of these people censure his actions or words. This distresses him greatly, not because he has failed to edify them - for that was not his aim - but because he has been humiliated.</p>
      <p> 76.  The presence of the passion of avarice reveals itself when a person enjoys receiving but resents having to give. Such a person is not fit to fulfill the office of treasurer or bursar.</p>
      <p> 77.  A man endures suffering either for the love of God, or for hope of reward, or for fear of punishment, or for fear of men, or because of his nature, or for pleasure, or for gain, or out of self-esteem, or from necessity.</p>
      <p> 78.  It is one thing to be delivered from sinful thoughts and another to be free from passions. Frequently a man is delivered from such thoughts when the things which rouse his passions are not present. But the passions lie hidden in the soul and are brought to light when the things themselves are present. Hence one must</p>
      <p> [V2] 96</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> watch over the intellect m the presence of things and must discern for which of them it manifests a passion.</p>
      <p> 79.  A true friend is one who in times of trial calmly and imperturbably suffers with his neighbor the ensuing afflictions, privations and disasters as if they were his own.</p>
      <p> 80.  Do not treat your conscience with contempt, for it always advises you to do what is best. It sets before you the will of God and the angels; it frees you from the secret defilements of the heart; and when you depart this life it grants you the gift of intimacy with God.</p>
      <p> 81.  If you wish to be a person of understanding and moderation, and not to be a slave to the passion of conceit, continually search among created things for what is hidden from your knowledge. When you find that there are vast numbers of different things that escape your notice, you will wonder at your ignorance and abase your</p>
      <p> presumption. And when you have come to know yourself, you wiU understand many great and wonderful things: for to think that one knows prevents one from advancing in knowledge.</p>
      <p> 82.  The person who truly wishes to be healed is he who does not refuse treatment. This treatment consists of the pain and distress brought on by various misfortunes. He who refuses them does not realize what they accomplish in this world or what he will gain from them when he departs this life.</p>
      <p> 83.   Self-esteem and avarice produce each other. Those who are full of self-esteem acquire riches and those who are rich become full of self-esteem. That is what happens to people living in the world. In the case of a monk, if he has renounced possessions, he becomes still more full of self-esteem; but if he has money he is ashamed and hides it as something unworthy of one who wears the habit.</p>
      <p> 84.  The mark of monastic self-esteem is to be puffed up about one's virtue and its consequences. The mark of monastic pride is to be conceited about one's own achievements, to ascribe these achievements to oneself and not to God, and to hold others in contempt. The mark of worldly self-esteem and pride is to be puffed up and conceited about one's beauty, wealth, power and moral judgment.</p>
      <p> 85.  The achievements of the worldly man constitute the failings of the monk, and the achievements of the monk constitute the failings of the worldly man. For example, the achievements of the worldly man are wealth, fame, power, luxury, comfort, children</p>
      <p> [V2] 97</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> and what is consequent upon all these things. But the monk is destroyed if he obtains any of them. His achievements are the total shedding of possessions, the rejection of esteem and power, self-control, hardship, and all that is consequent upon them. If a lover of the world obtains these against his will, he considers it a great calamity and is often in danger even of killing himself; some people have actually done this.</p>
      <p> Food was created for nourishment and healing. Those who eat food for purposes other than these two are therefore to be condemned as self-indulgent, because they misuse the gifts God has given us for our use. In all</p>
      <p> things misuse is a sin.</p>
      <p> 87.  Humility consists in constant prayer combined with tears and suffering. For this ceaseless calling upon God for help prevents us from foolishly growing confident in our own strength and wisdom, and from putting ourselves above others. These are dangerous diseases of the passion of pride.</p>
      <p> 88.  It is one thing to fight against a passion-free thought so that it will not stimulate a passion; it is another to fight against an impassioned thought so that there will be no assent to it. Both these two forms of counter-attack prevent the thoughts themselves from persisting.</p>
      <p> 89.  Resentment is linked with rancor. When the intellect forms the image of a brother's face with a feeling of resentment, it is clear that it harbors rancor against him. "The way of the rancorous leads to death' (Prov. 12:28. LXX), because "whoever harbors rancor is a transgressor' (Prov. 21:24. LXX).</p>
      <p> 90.   If you harbor rancor against anybody, pray for him and you will prevent the passion from being aroused; for by means of prayer you will separate your resentment from the thought of the wrong he has done you. When you have become loving and compassionate towards him, you will wipe the passion completely from your soul. If somebody regards you with rancor, be pleasant to him, be humble and agreeable in his company, and you will deliver him from his passion.</p>
      <p> 91.  You will find it hard to check the resentment of an envious person, for what he envies in you he considers his own misfortune. You cannot check his envy except by hiding from him the thing that arouses his passion. If this thing benefits many but fills him with resentment, which side will you take? You have to help the majority</p>
      <p> [V2] 98</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> but without, as far as possible, disregarding him, and without being seduced by the cunning of the passion itself, for you are defending not the passion but the sufferer. You must in humility consider him superior to yourself, and always, everywhere and in every matter put his interest above yours. As for your own envy, you will be able to check it if you rejoice with the man whom you envy whenever he rejoices, and grieve whenever he grieves, thus</p>
      <p> fulfilling St Paul's words, 'Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep' (Rom. 12:15).</p>
      <p> 92.  Our intellect lies between angel and demon, each of which works for its own ends, the one encouraging virtue and the other vice. The intellect has both the authority and the power to follow or resist whichever it wishes to.</p>
      <p> 93.  The angelic powers urge us towards what is holy. Our natural instincts and our probity of intention assist us. But the passions and sinfulness of intention reinforce the provocations of the demons.</p>
      <p> 94.  When the intellect is pure, sometimes God Himself approaches and teaches it: and sometimes the angelic powers, or the nature of the created things that it contemplates, suggest holy things to it.</p>
      <p> 95.  An intellect which has been granted spiritual knowledge must keep its conceptual images free from passion, its contemplation unfaltering, and its state of prayer untroubled. But it cannot always guard these from intrusions by the flesh, because it is obscured by the ploys of demons.</p>
      <p> 96.  The things that distress us are not always the same as those that make us angry, the things that distress us being far more numerous than those which make us angry. For example, the fact that something has been broken, or lost, or that a certain person has died, may only distress us. But other things may both distress us and make us angry, if we lack the spirit of divine philosophy.</p>
      <p> 97.  When the intellect gives attention to conceptual images of physical objects, it is assimilated to the configuration of each image. If it contemplates these objects spiritually, it is transformed in various ways according to which of them it contemplates. But once it is established in God, it loses form and configuration altogether, for by contemplating Him who is simple it becomes simple itself and wholly filled with spiritual radiance.</p>
      <p> [V2] 99</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> 98. A soul is perfect if its passible aspect is totally orientated towards God.</p>
      <p> 99.  A perfect intellect is one which by true faith and in a manner beyond all unknowing supremely knows the supremely Unknowable; and which, in surveying the entirety of God's creation, has received from God an all-embracing knowledge of the providence and judgment which governs it - in so far, of course, as all this is possible to man.</p>
      <p> 100.  Time has three divisions. Faith is coextensive with all three, hope with one, and love with the remaining two. Moreover, faith and hope will last to a certain point; but love, united beyond union with Him who is more than infinite, will remain for all eternity, always increasing beyond all measure. That is why "the greatest of them is love' (1 Cor. 13:13).</p>
      <p> [V2]100</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love Fourth Century</p>
      <p> 1.  First the intellect marvels when it reflects on the absolute infinity of God, that boundless sea for which it longs so much. Then it is amazed at how God has brought things into existence out of nothing. But just as 'His magnificence is without limit' (Ps. 145:3. LXX), so 'there is no penetrating His purposes' (Isa. 40:28).</p>
      <p> 2.  How can the intellect not marvel when it contemplates that immense and more than astonishing sea of goodness? Or how is it not astounded when it reflects on how and from what source there have come into being both nature endowed with intelligence and intellect, and the four elements which compose physical bodies, although no matter existed before their generation? What kind of potentiality was it which, once actualized, brought these things into being? But all this is not accepted by those who follow the pagan Greek philosophers, ignorant as they are of that all-powerful goodness and its effective wisdom and knowledge, transcending the human intellect.</p>
      <p> 3.  God is the Creator from all eternity, and He creates when He wills, in His infinite goodness, through His coessential Logos and Spirit. Do not raise the objection: "Why did He create at a particular moment since He is good from all eternity?' For I reply that the unsearchable wisdom of the infinite essence does not come within the compass of human knowledge.</p>
      <p> 4.  When the Creator willed. He gave being to and manifested that knowledge of created things which already existed in Him from all eternity. For in the case of almighty God it is ridiculous to doubt that He can give being to anything when He so wills.</p>
      <p> 5.    Try to learn why God created; for that is true knowledge. But do not try to learn how He created or why He did so comparatively recently; for that does not come within the compass of your mtel-</p>
      <p> [V2] 101</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love Fourth Century</p>
      <p> lect. Of divine realities some may be apprehended by men and others may not. Unbridled speculation, as one of the saints has said, can drive one headlong over the precipice.</p>
      <p> 6.   Some say that the created order has coexisted with God from eternity; but this is impossible. For how can things which are limited in every way coexist from eternity with Him who is altogether infinite? Or how are they really creations if they are coetemal with the Creator? This notion is drawn from the pagan Greek philosophers, who claim that God is in no way the creator of being but only of qualities. We, however, who know almighty God, say that He is the creator not only of qualities but also of the being of created things. If this is so, created things have not coexisted with God from eternity.</p>
      <p> 7.  Divinity and divine realities are in some respects knowable and in some respects unknowable. They are knowable in the contemplation of what appertains to God's essence and unknowable as regards that essence itself</p>
      <p> 8.  Do not look for conditions and properties in the simple and infinite essence of the Holy Trinity; otherwise you will make It composite like created beings - a ridiculous and blasphemous thing to do in the case of God.</p>
      <p> 9.  Only the infinite Being, all-powerful and creative of all things, is simple, unique, unqualified, peaceful and stable. Every creature, consisting as it does of being and accident, is composite and always in need of divine providence, for it is not free from change.</p>
      <p> 10.  Both intelligible and sensible nature, on being brought into existence by God, received powers to apprehend created beings. Intelligible nature received powers of intellection, and sensible nature powers of sense-perception.</p>
      <p> 11.  God is only participated in. Creation both participates and communicates: it participates in being and in well-being, but communicates only well-being. But corporeal nature communicates this in one way and incorporeal</p>
      <p> nature in another.</p>
      <p> 12.  Incorporeal nature communicates well-being by speaking, by acting, and by being contemplated; corporeal nature only by being contemplated.</p>
      <p> 13.  Whether or not a nature endowed with intelligence and        intellect is to exist eternally depends on the will of the Creator whose</p>
      <p> [V2] 102</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> every creation is good; but whether such a nature is good or bad depends on its own will.</p>
      <p> 14.  Evil is not to be imputed to the essence of created beings, but to their erroneous and mindless motivation.</p>
      <p> 15.  A soul's motivation is rightly ordered when its desiring power is subordinated to self-control, when its mcensive power rejects hatred and cleaves to love, and when its power of intelligence, through prayer and spiritual contemplation, advances towards God.</p>
      <p> 16.  If in time of trial a man does not patiently endure his afflictions, but cuts himself off from the love of his spiritual brethren, he does not yet possess perfect love or a deep knowledge of divine providence.</p>
      <p> 17.  The aim of divine providence is to unite by means of true faith and spiritual love those separated in various ways by vice. Indeed, the Savior endured His sufferings so that 'He should gather together into one the scattered children of God' (John 11: 52). Thus, he who does not resolutely bear trouble, endure affliction, and patiently sustain hardship, has strayed from the path of divine love and from the purpose of providence.</p>
      <p> 18.  If 'love is long-suffering and kind' (1 Cor. 13:4), a man who is fainthearted in the face of his afflictions and who therefore behaves wickedly towards those who have offended him, and stops loving them, surely lapses from the purpose of divine providence.</p>
      <p> reconciled with him without delay, so that you do not lapse from the commandment of love.</p>
      <p> 20.  Do not hold the commandment of love in contempt, for through it you will become a son of God. But if you transgress it, you will become a son of Gehenna.</p>
      <p> 21.  What separates us from the love of friends is envying or being envied, causing or receiving harm, insulting or being insulted, and suspicious thoughts. Would that you had never done or experienced anything of this sort and in this way separated yourself from the love of a friend.</p>
      <p> 22.  Has a brother been the occasion of some trial for you and has your resentment led you to hatred? Do not let yourself be overcome by this hatred, but conquer it with love. You will succeed in this by praying to God sincerely for your brother and by accepting his</p>
      <p> [V2] 103</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> apology: or else by conciliating him with an apology yourself, by regarding yourself as responsible for the trial and by patiently waiting until the cloud has passed.</p>
      <p> 23. A long-suffering man is one who waits patiently for his trial to end and hopes that his perseverance will be rewarded.</p>
      <p> 24.  'The long-suffering man abounds in understanding" (Prov. 14:29), because he endures everything to the end and, while awaiting that end, patiently bears his distress. The end, as St Paul says, is everlasting life (cf. Rom. 6:22). 'And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent' (John 17:3).</p>
      <p> 25.  Do not lightly discard spiritual love: for men there is no other road to salvation.</p>
      <p> whom yesterday you regarded as spiritual and virtuous: but with long-suffering love dwell on the goodness you perceived yesterday and expel today's hatred from your soul.</p>
      <p> 27.  Do not condemn today as base and wicked the man whom yesterday you praised as good and commended as virtuous, changing from love to hatred, because he has criticized you; but even though you are still full of resentment, commend him as before, and you will soon recover the same saving love.</p>
      <p> 28.   When talking with other brethren, do not adulterate your usual praise of a brother by surreptitiously introducing censure into the conversation because you still harbor some hidden resentment against him. On the contrary, in the company of others give unmixed praise and pray for him sincerely as if you were praying for yourself; then you will soon be delivered from this destructive hatred.</p>
      <p> 29.  Do not say, "I do not hate my brother', when you simply efface the thought of him from your mind. Listen to Moses, who said, "Do not hate your brother in your mind; but reprove him and you will not incur sin through him' (Lev. 19:17. LXX).</p>
      <p> 30.  If a brother happens to be tempted and persists in insulting you, do not be driven out of your state of love, even though the same evil demon troubles your mind. You will not be driven out of that state if, when abused, you bless: when slandered, you praise;</p>
      <p> and when tricked, you maintain your affection. This is the way of</p>
      <p> [V2] 104</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> Christ's philosophy: if you do not follow it you do not share His company.</p>
      <p> 31. Do not think that those who bring you reports which fill you with resentment and make you hate your brother are affectionately disposed towards you, even if they seem to speak the truth. On the contrary, turn away from them as if they were poisonous snakes, so that you may both prevent them from uttering slanders and deliver your own soul from wickedness.</p>
      <p> 32.  Do not irritate your brother by speaking to him equivocaUy;</p>
      <p> otherwise you may receive the same treatment from him and so drive out both your love and his. Rather, rebuke him frankly and affectionately, thus removing the grounds for resentment and freeing both him and yourself from your irritation and distress.</p>
      <p> 33.  Examine your conscience scrupulously, in case it is your fault that your brother is still hostile. Do not cheat your conscience, for it knows your secrets, and at the hour of your death it will accuse you and in time of prayer it will be a stumbling-block to you.</p>
      <p> 34.  In times of peaceful relationships do not recall what was said by a brother when there was bad feeling between you, even if offensive things were said to your face, or to another person about you and you subsequently heard of them. Otherwise you will harbor thoughts of rancor and revert to your destructive hatred of your brother.</p>
      <p> 35.  The deifonn soul cannot nurse hatred against a man and yet be at peace with God, the giver of the commandments. "For', He says, 'if you do not forgive men their faults, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you your faults' (cf Matt. 6:14-15). If your brother does not wish to live peaceably with you, nevertheless guard yourself against hatred, praying for him sincerely and not abusing him to anybody.</p>
      <p> 36.  The perfect peace of the holy angels lies in their love for God and their love for one another. This is also the case with all the saints from the beginning of time. Most traly therefore is it said that 'on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets' (Matt. 22:40).</p>
      <p> 37.  Stop pleasing yourself and you will not hate your brother; stop loving yourself and you will love God.</p>
      <p> 38.  Once you have decided to share your life with spiritual brethren, renounce your own wishes from the start. Unless you do</p>
      <p> [V2] 105</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love Fourth Century</p>
      <p> this you will not be able to live peaceably either with God or with your brethren.</p>
      <p> 39.  He who has attained perfect love, and has ordered his whole life in accordance with it, is the person who says 'Lord Jesus' in the Holy Spirit (cf 1 Cor. 12:3).</p>
      <p> 40.  Love for God always aspires to give wings to the intellect in its communion with God; love for one's neighbor makes one always think good thoughts about him.</p>
      <p> 41.  The man who still loves empty fame, or is attached to some material object, is naturally vexed with people on account of transitory things, or harbors rancor or hatred against them, or is a slave to shameful thoughts. Such things are quite foreign to the soul that loves God,</p>
      <p> 42.   If you have no thought of any shameful word or action in your mind, harbor no rancor against someone who has injured or slandered you, and, while praying, always keep your intellect free from matter and form, you may be sure that you have attained the full measure of dispassion and perfect love.</p>
      <p> 43.  It is no small struggle to be freed from self-esteem. Such freedom is to be attained by the inner practice of the virtues and by more frequent prayer: and the sign that you have attained it is that you no longer harbor rancor against anybody who abuses or has abused you.</p>
      <p> 44.  If you want to be a just person, assign to each aspect of yourself - to your soul and your body - what accords with it. To the intelligent aspect of the soul assign spiritual reading, contemplation and prayer; to the mcensive aspect, spiritual love, the opposite of hatred; to the desiring aspect, moderation and self-control; to the fleshly part, food and clothing, for these alone are necessary (cf. 1 Tim. 6:8).</p>
      <p> 45.  The intellect functions in accordance with nature when it keeps the passions under control, contemplates the inner essences of created beings, and abides with God.</p>
      <p> 46.  As health and disease are to the body of a living thing, and light and darkness to the eye, so virtue and vice are to the soul, and knowledge and ignorance to the intellect.</p>
      <p> commandments separate the intellect from the passions: the doctrines lead it to the</p>
      <p> [V2] 106</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> spiritual knowledge of created beings: and faith to the contemplation of the Holy Trinity.</p>
      <p> 48.  Some of those pursuing the spiritual way only repel impassioned thoughts: others cut off the passions themselves. Such thoughts are repelled by psalmody, or by prayer, or by raising one's mind to God, or by occupying one's attention in some similar way. The passions are cut off through appropriate detachment from those things by which they are roused.</p>
      <p> 49.  The passions are roused in us by, for example, women, wealth, fame and so on. We can achieve detachment with regard to women when, after withdrawing from the world, we wither the body, as we should, through self-control. We can achieve detachment where wealth is concerned when we make up our mind to be frugal in all things. We can become indifferent to fame by practicing the virtues inwardly, in a way visible only to God. And we can act in a similar fashion with respect to other things. A person who has achieved such detachment as this will never hate anybody.</p>
      <p> 50.   He who has renounced such things as marriage, possessions and other worldly pursuits is outwardly a monk, but may not yet be a monk inwardly. Only he who has renounced the impassioned conceptual images of these things has made a monk of the inner self, the intellect. It is easy to be a monk in one's outer self if one wants to be: but no small struggle is required to be a monk in one's inner self.</p>
      <p> 51.  Who in this generation is completely freed from impassioned conceptual images, and has been granted uninterrupted, pure and spiritual prayer? Yet this is the mark of the inner monk.</p>
      <p> 52.   Many passions are hidden in our souls: they can be brought to light only when the objects that rouse them are present.</p>
      <p> 53.  A man can enjoy partial dispassion and not be disturbed by passions when the objects which rouse them are absent. But once those objects are present, the passions quickly distract his intellect.</p>
      <p> 54.  Do not imagine that you enjoy perfect dispassion when the object arousing your passion is not present. If when it is present you remain unmoved by both the object and the subsequent thought of it, you may be sure that you have entered the realm of dispassion. But even so do not be over-confident; for virtue when habitual kills the passions, but when it is neglected they come to life again.</p>
      <p> [V2] 107</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> 55.  He who loves Christ is bound to imitate Him to the best of his ability. Christ, for example, was always conferring blessings on people: He was long-suffering when they were ungrateful and blasphemed Him: and when they beat Him and put Him to death. He endured it, imputing no evil at all to anyone. These are the three acts which manifest love for one's neighbor. If he is incapable of them, the person who says that he loves Christ or has attained the kingdom deceives himself. For "not everyone who says to Me: "Lord, Lord" shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that does the will of My Father" (Matt. 7:21); and again, 'He who loves Me will keep My commandments' (cf John 14:15, 23).</p>
      <p> 56.  The whole purpose of the Savior's commandments is to free the intellect from dissipation and hatred, and to lead it to the love of Him and one's neighbor. From this love springs the light of active holy knowledge.</p>
      <p> 57.  When God has granted you a degree of spiritual knowledge, do not neglect love and self-control: for it is these which, once they have purified the soul's passible aspect, always keep open for you the way to such knowledge.</p>
      <p> 58.  Dispassion and humility lead to spiritual knowledge. Without them no one will see the Lord.</p>
      <p> 59.   Since "knowledge puffs up, but love edifies" (1 Cor. 8:1), unite love with knowledge and you will free yourself from arrogance and be a spiritual builder, edifying both yourself and all who draw near you.</p>
      <p> display what provokes envy: it does not reckon that its purpose has yet been attained (of. Phil. 3:13), and it unhesitatingly confesses its ignorance of what it does not know. Hence it frees the intellect from arrogance and always equips it to advance in knowledge.</p>
      <p> 61. It is natural for spiritual knowledge to produce conceit and envy, especially in the early stages. Conceit comes only from within, but envy comes both from within and from without - from within when we feel envious of those who have knowledge, from without when those who love knowledge feel envious of us. Love destroys all three of these failings: conceit, because love is not puffed up: envy from within, because love is not jealous: and envy from without, because love is iong-suffering and kind" (1 Cor. 13:4). A</p>
      <p> [V2] 108</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> person with spiritual knowledge must, then, also acquire love, so that he may always keep his intellect in a healthy state.</p>
      <p> 62.  He who has been granted the grace of spiritual knowledge and yet harbors resentment, rancor or hatred for anybody, is like someone who lacerates his eyes with thorns and thistles. Hence knowledge must be accompanied by love.</p>
      <p> 63.   Do not devote all your time to your body but apply to it a measure of asceticism appropriate to its strength, and then turn all your intellect to what is within. 'Bodily asceticism has only a limited use, but true devotion is useful in all things' (ITim. 4:8).</p>
      <p> 64.  He who always concentrates on the inner life becomes restrained, long-suffering, kind and humble. He will also be able to contemplate, theologize and pray. That is what St Paul meant when he said: 'Walk in the Spirit' (Gal. 5:16).</p>
      <p> 65.  One ignorant of the spiritual path is not on his guard against impassioned conceptual images, but devotes himself entirely to the flesh. He is either a glutton, or licentious, or fall of resentment, anger and rancor. As a result he darkens his intellect, or he practices excessive asceticism and so confuses his mind.</p>
      <p> 66.  Scripture does not forbid anything which God has given us for our use; but it condemns immoderation and thoughtless behavior. For instance, it does not forbid us to eat, or to beget children, or to possess material things and to administer them properly. But it does forbid us to be gluttonous, to fornicate and so on. It does not forbid us to think of these things — they were made to be thought of - but it forbids us to think of them with passion.</p>
      <p> 67.  Some of the things which we do for the sake of God are done in obedience to the commandments: others are done not in obedience to the commandments but, so to speak, as a voluntary offering. For example, we are required by the commandments to love God and our neighbor, to love our enemies, not to commit adultery or murder and so on. And when we transgress these commandments, we are condemned. But we are not commanded to live as virgins, to abstain from marriage, to renounce possessions, to withdraw into solitude and so forth. These are of the nature of gifts, so that if through weakness we are unable to fulfill some of the commandments, we may by these free gifts propitiate our blessed Master.</p>
      <p> 68.  He who honors celibacy and virginity must keep his loins girded and his lamp burning (cf Luke 12:35). He keeps his loins</p>
      <p> [V2] 109</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> girded through self-control, and his lamp burning through prayer, contemplation and spiritual love.</p>
      <p> 69.  Some of the brethren think that they are excluded from the Holy Spirit's gifts of grace. Because they neglect to practice the commandments they do not know that he who has an unadulterated faith in Christ has within him the sum total of all the divine gifts. Since through our laziness we are far from having an active love for Him - a love which shows us the divine treasures within us - we naturally think that we are excluded from these gifts.</p>
      <p> 70.  If, as St Paul says, Christ dwells in our hearts through faith (cf Eph. 3:17), and all the treasures of wisdom and spiritual knowledge are hidden in Him (cf. Col. 2:3), then all the treasures of wisdom and spiritual knowledge are hidden in our hearts. They are revealed to the heart in proportion to our purification by means of the comm andments.</p>
      <p> 71. This is the treasure hidden in the field of your heart (of. Matt. 13:44), which you have not yet found because of your laziness. Had you found it, you would have sold everything and bought that field. But now you have abandoned that field and give all your attention to the land nearby, where there is nothing but thorns and thistles.</p>
      <p> 72.  It is for this reason that the Savior says, 'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God" (Matt. 5:8) for He is hidden in the hearts of those who believe in Him. They shall see Him and the riches that are in Him when they have purified themselves through love and self-control; and the greater their purity, the more they will see.</p>
      <p> 73.  And that is why He also says, "Sell what you possess and give alms' (Luke 12:33), 'and you will find that all things are clean for you" (Luke 11:41). This applies to those who no longer spend their time on things to do with the body, but strive to cleanse the intellect (which the Lord calls 'heart") from hatred and dissipation. For these defile the intellect and do not allow it to see Christ, who dwells in it by the grace of holy baptism.</p>
      <p> 74.   In Scripture the virtues are called 'ways'. The greatest of all the virtues is love. That is why St Paul said, 'Now 1 will show you the best way of all" (1 Cor. 12:31), one that persuades us to scorn material things and value nothing transitory more than what is eternal.</p>
      <p> [V2] 110</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> 75.  Love of God is opposed to desire, for it persuades the intellect to control itself with regard to sensual pleasures. Love for our neighbor is opposed to anger, for it makes us scorn fame and riches. These are the two pence which our Savior gave to the innkeeper (cf Luke 10:31), so that he should take care of you. But do not be thoughtless and associate with robbers; otherwise you will be beaten again and left not merely unconscious but dead.</p>
      <p> 76.  Cleanse your intellect from anger, rancor and shameful thoughts, and you will be able to perceive the indwelling of Christ.</p>
      <p> incarnate dispensation of one of the Holy Trinity? Who taught you about the inner essences of incorporeal beings, or about the origin and consummation of the visible world, or about the resurrection from the dead and eternal life, or about the glory of the kingdom of heaven and the dreadful judgment? Was it not the grace of Christ dwelling in you, which is the pledge of the Holy Spirit? What is greater than this grace? What is more noble than this wisdom and knowledge? What is more lofty than these promises? But if we are lazy and negligent, and if we do not cleanse ourselves from the passions which defile us, blinding our intellect and so preventing us from seeing the inner nature of these realities more clearly than the sun, let us blame ourselves and not deny the indwelling of grace.</p>
      <p> 78.  God, who has promised you eternal blessings (cf. Tit. 1:2) and has given you the pledge of the Spirit in your hearts (cf. 2 Cor. 1:22), has commanded you to pay attention to how you live, so that the inner man may be freed from the passions and begin here and now to enjoy these blessings.</p>
      <p> 79.  When you have been granted the higher forms of the contemplation of divine realities, give your utmost attention to love and self-control, so that you may keep your soul's passible aspect undisturbed and preserve the light of your soul in undimmished splendor.</p>
      <p> 80.  Bridle your soul's mcensive power with love, quench its desire with self-control, give wings to its intelligence with prayer, and the light of your intellect will never be darkened.</p>
      <p> 81.  Disgrace, injury, slander either against one's faith or one's manner of life, beatings, blows and so on - these are the things which dissolve love, whether they happen to oneself or to any of</p>
      <p> [V2] 111</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love Fourth Century</p>
      <p> one's relatives or friends. He who loses his love because of these things has not yet understood the purpose of Christ's commandments.</p>
      <p> 82.  Strive as hard as you can to love every man. If you cannot yet do this, at least do not hate anybody. But even this is beyond your power unless you scorn worldly things.</p>
      <p> you hate the vihfier, you have hated a man and so broken the commandment. What he has done in word you do in action. To keep the commandment, show the quahties of love and help him in any way you can, so that you may deliver him from evil.</p>
      <p> 84.  Christ does not want you to feel the least hatred, resentment, anger or rancor towards anyone in any way or on account of any transitory thing whatsoever. This is proclaimed throughout the four Gospels.</p>
      <p> 85.  Many of us are talkers, few are doers. But no one should distort the word of God through his own negligence. He must confess his weakness and not hide God's truth. Otherwise he will be guilty not only of breaking the commandments but also of falsifying the word of God.</p>
      <p> 86.  Love and self-control free the soul from passions; spiritual reading and contemplation deliver the intellect from ignorance; and the state of prayer brings it into the presence of God Himself.</p>
      <p> 87.  When the demons see that we scorn the things of this world in order not to hate men on account of such things, and so to fall away from love, then they incite slanders against us. In this way they hope that, unable to contain our resentment, we will be provoked into hating those who slander us.</p>
      <p> 88.  Nothing pains the soul more than slander, whether directed against one's faith or one's manner of life. No one can be indifferent to it except those who like Susanna have their eyes firmly fixed on God (cf. Sus. verse 35). For only God has the power to rescue from peril, as He rescued her, to convince men of the truth, as He did in her case, and to encourage the soul with hope.</p>
      <p> 89.  To the extent that you pray with all your soul for the person who slanders you, God will make the truth known to those who have been scandalized by the slander.</p>
      <p> 90.  Only God is good by nature (cf. Matt. 19:17), and only he</p>
      <p> [V2] 112</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Four Hundred Texts on Love Fourth Century</p>
      <p> who imitates God is good in will and purpose. For it is the intention of such a person to unite the wicked to Him who is good by nature, so that they too may become good. That is why, though reviled by them, he blesses; persecuted, he endures; vilified, he supplicates (cf 1 Cor. 4:12-13); put to death, he prays for them. He does everything so as not to lapse from the purpose of love, which is God Himself.</p>
      <p> 91.  The Lord's commandments teach us to use neutral things intelligently. Such use purifies the soul's state. A state of purity begets discrimination; discrimination begets dispassion; and it is from dispassion that perfect love is bom.</p>
      <p> 92.  If when some trial occurs you cannot overlook a friend's fault, whether real or apparent, you have not yet attained dispassion. For when the passions which lie deep in the soul are disturbed, they blind the mind, preventing it from perceiving the light of truth and from discriminating between good and evil. If you are in such a state you have likewise not yet attained perfect love, the love which expels the fear of judgment (cf. 1 John 4:18).</p>
      <p> 93.  'A faithful friend is beyond price' (Ecclus. 6:15), since he regards his friend's misfortunes as his own and suffers with him, sharing his trials until death.</p>
      <p> 94.  Friends are many, but in times of prosperity (cf. Prov. 19:4). In times of adversity you will have difficulty in finding even one.</p>
      <p> 95.  One should love every man from the soul, but one should place one's hope only in God and serve Him with all one's strength. For so long as He protects us against harm, all our friends treat us with respect and all our enemies are powerless to injure us. But once He abandons us, all our friends turn away from us while all our enemies prevail against us.</p>
      <p> 96.   There are four principal ways in which God abandons us. The first is the way of the divine dispensation, so that through our apparent abandonment others who are abandoned may be saved. Our Lord is an example of this (cf Matt. 27:46). The second is the way of trial and testing, as in the case of job and Joseph; for it made Job a pillar of courage and Joseph a pillar of self-restraint (cf. Gen. 39:8). The third is the way of fatherly correction, as in the case of St Paul, so that by being humble he might preserve the superabundance of grace (cf. 2 Cor. 12:7). The fourth is the way of rejection.</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Four Hundred Texts on Love</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> as in the case of the Jews, so that by being punished they might be brought to repentance. These are all ways of salvation, full of divine blessing and wisdom.</p>
      <p> 97. Only those who scrupulously keep the commandments, and are true initiates into divine judgments, do not abandon their friends when God permits these friends to be put to the test. Those who scorn the commandments and who are ignorant about divine judgments rejoice with their friend in the times of his prosperity;</p>
      <p> but when in times of trial he suffers hardships, they abandon him and sometimes even side with those who attack him.</p>
      <p> 98.  The friends of Christ love all truly but are not themselves loved by all: the friends of the world neither love all nor are loved by all. The friends of Christ persevere in love to the end; the friends of the world persevere only until they fall out with each other over some worldly thing.</p>
      <p> 99.  'A faithful friend is a strong defense" (Ecclus. 6:14); for when things are going well with you, he is a good counselor and a sympathetic collaborator, while when things are going badly, he is the truest of helpers and a most compassionate supporter.</p>
      <p> 100.Many have said much about love, but you will find love itself only if you seek it among the disciples of Christ. For only they have true Love as love's teacher. 'Though I have the gift of prophecy', says St Paul, 'and know all mysteries and all knowledge . . . and have no love, it profits me nothing' (1 Cor. 13:2-3). He who possesses love possesses God Himself, for "God is love' (1 John 4:8). To Him be glory throughout the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios First Century</p>
      <p> God is one, unoriginate, incomprehensible, possessing completely the total potentiality of being, altogether excluding notions of when and how, inaccessible to all, and not to be known through natural image by any creature.</p>
      <p> So far as we are able to understand, for Himself God does not constitute either an origin, or an intermediary state, or a consummation, or anything else at all which can be seen to qualify naturally things that are sequent to Him. For He is undetermined, unchanging and infinite, since He is infinitely beyond all being, potentiality and actualization.</p>
      <p> 3.   Every being whose self-limitation is intrinsic to it is by nature the origin of the activity perceived as' potentially present within it. Every natural activity in the process of actualization - and such activity is, on the conceptual level, sequent to the being itself but prior to its own actualization - is an intermediary state, since by nature it lies between the being in which it is present potentially and its own actualization. Every actualization, limited as it naturally is by its own inner principle, is the consummation of that activity which has its origm in the being and which, conceptually speaking, precedes the actualization.</p>
      <p> 4.  God is not a being either in the general or in any specific sense of the word, and so He cannot be an "origin. Nor is He a potentiality either in the general or in any specific sense, and so He is not an intermediary state. Nor is He an actualization in the</p>
      <p> [V2] 115</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts on Theology</p>
      <p> and the</p>
      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> general or in any specific sense, and so He cannot be the consummation of that activity which proceeds from a being in which it is perceived to pre-exist as a potentiahty. On the contrary. He is the author of being and simuhaneously an entity transcending being; He is the author of potentiahty and simultaneously the ground transcending potentiality; and He is the active and inexhaustible state of all actualization. In short. He is the author of all being, potentiality and actualization, and of every origin, intermediary state and consummation.</p>
      <p> 5.  Origin, the intermediary state and consummation characterize things divided by time, as indeed they characterize things existing in the eon. For time, by which change is measured, is defined numerically; while the eon, whose existence presupposes a "when', possesses dimensionality, since its existence has an origin. And if time and the eon have an origin, how much more so will those things that exist within them.</p>
      <p> 6.   God by nature is always one and alone, substantively and absolutely, containing in Himself ail-inclusively the totality of substantive being, since He transcends even substantiveness itself. If this is so, there is nothing whatsoever among all the things to which we ascribe being that possess substantive being. Thus nothing whatsoever different in essence from God can be envisaged as coexisting with Him from eternity - neither the eon, nor time, nor anything which exists within them. For substantive being and being which is not substantive never coincide.</p>
      <p> 7.  No origin, intermediary state or consummation can ever be altogether free from the category of relationship. God, being infinitely beyond every kind of relationship, is by nature neither an origin, nor an intermediary state, nor a consummation, nor any of those things to which it is possible to apply the category of relationship.</p>
      <p> 8.   Created beings are termed intelligible because each of them has an origin that can be known rationally. But God cannot be termed intelligible, while from our apprehension of intelligible beings we can do no more than believe that He exists. On this account no intelligible being is in any way to be compared with Him.</p>
      <p> 9.  Created beings can be known rationally by means of the inner principles which are by nature intrinsic to such beings and by which</p>
      <p> [V2] 116</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts on Theology</p>
      <p> and the Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> they are naturally defined. But from our apprehension of these principles inherent in created beings we can do no more than believe that God exists. To the devout believer God gives something more sure than any proof: the recognition and the faith that He substantively is. Faith is true knowledge, the principles of which are beyond rational demonstration; for faith makes real for us things beyond intellect and reason (cf. Heb. 11:1 ).</p>
      <p> 10.  God is the origin, intermediary state and consummation of all created things, but as acting upon things not as acted upon, which is also the case where everything else we call Him is concerned. He is origin as Creator, intermediary state as provident ruler, and consummation as final end. For, as Scripture says, "All things are from Him and through Him, and have Him as their goal" (Rom. 11:36).</p>
      <p> 11.  No deiform soul is in its essence of greater value than any other deiform soul. For when God in His supernal goodness creates each soul in His own image. He brings it into being endowed with self-determination. By exercising this freedom of choice each soul either reaffirms its true nobility or through its actions deliberately embraces what is ignoble.</p>
      <p> 12.  God, it is said, is the Sun of righteousness (cf. Mai. 4:2), and the rays of His supernal goodness shine down on all men alike. The soul is wax if it cleaves to God, but clay if it cleaves to matter. Which it does depends upon its own will and purpose. Clay hardens in the sun, while wax grows soft. Similarly, every soul that, despite God's admonitions, deliberately cleaves to the material world, hardens like clay and drives itself to destruction, just as Pharaoh did (cf. Exod. 7:13). But every soul that cleaves to God is softened like wax and, receiving the impress and stamp of divine realities, it becomes "in spirit the dwelling-place of God" (Eph. 2:22).</p>
      <p> 13.  If a person's intellect is illumined with intellections of the divine, if his speech is unceasingly devoted to singing the praises of the Creator, and if his senses are hallowed by unsullied images - he has enhanced that sanctity which is his by nature, as created in the image of God, by adding to it the sanctity of the divine likeness that is attained through the exercise of his own free will.</p>
      <p> 14.  A man keeps his soul undefiled before God if he compels his mind to meditate only on God and His supreme goodness, makes his thought a true interpreter and exponent of this goodness, and teaches his senses to form holy images of the visible world and all</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts on Theology</p>
      <p> and the</p>
      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios First Century</p>
      <p> the things in it, and to convey to the soul the magnificence of the inner principles lying within all things.</p>
      <p> 15.   God has freed us from bitter slavery to tyrannical demons and has given us humility as a compassionate yoke of devoutness. It is humility which tames every demonic power, produces in those who accept it every kind of sanctity, and keeps that sanctity inviolate.</p>
      <p> 16.  He who believes fears; he who fears is humble; he who is humble becomes gentle and renders inactive those impulses of m-censiveness and desire which are contrary to nature. A person who is gentle keeps the commandments; he who keeps the commandments is purified; he who is purified is illumined; he who is illumined is made a consort of the divine Bridegroom and Logos in the shrine of the mysteries.</p>
      <p> 17.  Sometimes when a farmer is looking for a suitable spot to which to transplant a tree, he unexpectedly comes across a treasure. Something similar may happen to the seeker after God. If he is humble and unaffected, and if his soul, after the example of the blessed Jacob (cf Gen. 27:11), is sleek, and not hirsute with materiality, then God may grant him the contemplation of divine wisdom even though he has not labored for it. But if the Father then asks him how he came by this knowledge, saying to him "What is this you have found so quickly. My son?' he should reply, as Jacob did, 'It is what the Lord God has granted to me" (Gen. 27:20. LXX). We should realize in such a case that what he has found is a spiritual treasure; for the devoted seeker after God is a spiritual farmer who transplants, as if it were a tree, his contemplation of visible and sensory things to the field of noetic realities; and in so doing he find a treasure - the revelation by grace of the wisdom in created things.</p>
      <p> 18.  Although in his humility he has not expected it, the seeker after God may suddenly receive spiritual knowledge of divine contemplation. But this may so devastate the mind of someone else who is unsuccessfully toiling to</p>
      <p> acquire such knowledge for the sake of self-display that, mad with jealousy, he plots to murder his brother and grows sick with resentment because he does not experience the elation that comes from being praised.</p>
      <p> 19.  Those who seek spiritual knowledge with much labor, but do not succeed in finding it, fail either through lack of faith or perhaps because in their stupidity and jealousy they have it in mind to</p>
      <p> [V2] 118</p>

      <p> Written for Thalassios</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> attack those who possess knowledge, just as the people of old once attacked Moses. We can rightly apply to them the passage in Scripture which says that when some men tried to force their way up the mountain, the Amorites dwelling in that mountain came out and wounded them (cf Deut. 1:43-44). For inevitably those who put on a show of holiness for the sake of self-display not only fail to achieve anythmg through their false piety, but also are wounded by their conscience.</p>
      <p> 20.  He who pursues spiritual knowledge for the sake of display and fails to attain it should not envy his neighbor or be cast down. On the Contrary, as commanded, let him observe the preparation for the Sabbath in some nearby place: through the practice of the virtues, by working hard with his body, he will prepare his soul for that knowledge.</p>
      <p> 21.  Those who truly and devoutly aspire to an understanding of created beings, and have no thoughts of self-display, will find that they are granted lucid insight into such beings and that through this insight they attain the knowledge they seek in a most precise fashion. To such people the Law says, "You will come and inherit fine large cities, and houses which you did not build, full of good things, and deep wells which you did not dig, and vines and olive trees which you did not plant' (cf. Deut. 6:10-11). For he who lives not for himself but for God (cf. 2 Cor. 5:15) is filled with all the gifts of grace, which were not previously apparent in him because of the</p>
      <p> disturbance produced by the passions.</p>
      <p> 22.  There are said to be two forms of sense-perception. The first is a habitual state and persists even when we are asleep. It does not grasp any particular object and it serves no purpose because it is not directed towards an action. The second is the active sense-perception through which we apprehend sensible objects. Similarly, there are two forms of knowledge. First, there is academic knowledge, which is theoretical information, gathered merely from habit, about the inner principles of created beings, and which serves no purpose because it is not directed towards the practical execution of the commandments. Secondly, there is actively effective knowledge, which confers a trae experiential apprehension of created beings.</p>
      <p> 23.  A hypocrite, hunting after the glory that comes from an apparent righteousness, is untroubled so long as he thinks that he</p>
      <p> [V2] 119</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>

      <p> and the</p>
      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios First Century</p>
      <p> escapes notice. But when he is detected, he utters streams of imprecation, imagining that by abusing others he can hide his own deformity. Because of his craftiness Scripture has compared him to the offspring of vipers and has commanded him to bring forth appropriate fruits of repentance (cf. Matt. 3:7-8), that is, to refashion the hidden state of his heart so that it conforms to his outward behavior.</p>
      <p> 24. Some say that every living creature inhabiting air, earth or sea which the Law does not judge to be clean (cf. Lev. 11:1-43) is wild, even if it seems from its behavior to be tame. By the same principle, every man subject to some passion is also wild, whatever his outward behavior.</p>
      <p> 25.  He who puts on a show of friendship in order to do his neighbor some injury is a wolf hiding his wickedness under sheep's clothing. Whenever he finds a custom or saying which is genuinely Christian, although somewhat naive, he seizes on it and attacks it; in numberless ways he finds fault with these sayings or customs, prying into the liberty which the brethren have in Christ (cf. Gal.2:4).</p>
      <p> 26.  He who hypocritically keeps silent for some evil purpose prepares a trap for his neighbor; and if his plan fails, he slinks off, having brought distress on himself because of his own passion. But he who is silent for a good end nourishes friendship and goes on his way rejoicing, for he has received the enlightenment which dispels darkness.</p>
      <p> 27.  If a man impetuously interrupts a speech at a public meeting, he clearly reveals his lust for self-glory. Overpowered by this passion, he tries to obstruct the course of the discussion with endless complicated proposals.</p>
      <p> 28.  A wise man, whether teaching or learning, only wishes to learn or teach those things which are useful. He who merely has the appearance of wisdom, whether asking or answering questions, only deals with relatively trivial things.</p>
      <p> 29.  A person who through the grace of God partakes of divine blessings is under an obligation to share them ungrudgingly with others. For Scripture says, 'Freely you have received, freely give' (Matt. 10:8). He who hides the gift in the earth accuses the Lord of being hard-hearted and mean (cf. Matt. 25:24), and in order to spare the flesh he pretends to know nothing about holiness; while</p>

      <p> he who sells the truth to enemies, and is then revealed as avid for self-glory, hangs himself, unable to bear the disgrace (of Matt. 26:15; 27:5).</p>
      <p> 30.  Those who still fear the war against the passions and dread the assaults of invisible enemies must keep silent in their struggle for virtue they must not enter into disputes with their enemies but through prayer must entrust all anxiety about themselves to God. To them apply the words of Exodus: 'The Lord will fight for you, and you must be silent' (Exod. 14:14). Those, secondly, who have been released from the enemy's attacks and who genuinely seek instruction in the ways of acquiring the virtues, need only to keep the ear of their mind open. To them Scripture says, "Hear 0 Israel' (Deut. 6:4). Thirdly, those who as a result of their purification ardently long for divine knowledge may commune with God freely. To them it will be said, "What is it that you are calling to Me?' (Exod. 14:15. LXX). Thus, he who is commanded to keep silent because of his fear should seek refuge in God; he who is commanded to listen should be ready to obey the commandments; and he who pursues spiritual knowledge should call ceaselessly to God, beseeching Him for deliverance from evil and thanking Him for communion in His blessings.</p>
      <p> 31.  A soul can never attain the knowledge of God unless God Himself in His condescension takes hold of it and raises it up to Himself. For the human intellect lacks the power to ascend and to participate in divine illumination, unless God Himself draws it up - in so far as this is possible for the human intellect - and illumines it with rays of divine light.</p>
      <p> 32.  He who imitates the disciples of the Lord does not refuse, out of fear for the Pharisees, to walk through the cornfields on the Sabbath and pluck ears of com (cf. Matt. 12:1-2). On the contrary, when after practicing the virtues he attains the state of dispassion, he culls the inner principles of created beings and devoutly nourishes himself with the divine knowledge they contain.</p>
      <p> 33.  According to the Gospel, the person who is simply a man of faith can remove the mountain of his sin through the practice of the virtues (cf. Matt. 17:20). thus freeing himself from his former attachment to the restless gyration of sensible things. If he has the capacity to be a disciple he receives fragments of the loaves of spiritual knowledge from the hands of the Logos and feeds thousands</p>
      <p> [V2] 121</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>

      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> of people (cf. Matt. 14:19-20), demonstrating by his action how the power of the Logos is increased and multiplied by the practice of the virtues. If he also has the strength to be an apostle he cures every disease and infirmity: he casts out demons (cf. Matt. 10:8;</p>
      <p> Luke 10:17), that is, he banishes the activity of the passions; he heals the sick, through hope restoring a state of devotion to those who have lost it, and through his teaching about judgment stiffening the resolve of those who have been softened by sloth. For, since he has been commanded "to tread on serpents and scorpions' (Luke 10:19), he destroys the beginning and end of sin.</p>
      <p> 34.   An apostle is necessarily also a disciple and a man of faith. A disciple is not necessarily also an apostle but he is certainly a man of faith. A person who is simply a man of faith is neither a disciple nor an apostle. However, through his manner of life and through contemplation he can be raised to the rank and dignity of a disciple, and a disciple can be raised to the rank and dignity of an apostle.</p>
      <p> 35.  When what has been created in time according to the temporal order has reached maturity, it ceases from natural growth. But when what has been brought about by the knowledge of God through the practice of the virtues has reached maturity, it starts to grow anew. For the end of one stage constitutes the starting-point of the next. He who has put an end to the root of corruption in himself by practicing the virtues is initiated into other more divine experiences. There is never an end, as there is never a beginning, to the good which God does: just as the property of light is to illuminate, so the property of God is to do good. Thus in the Law, which is concerned with the structure of temporal things subject to generation and decay, the Sabbath is honored by rest from work (cf. Exod. 31:14), whereas in the Gospel, which initiates us into the realm of spiritual realities, luster is shed on the Sabbath by good actions (cf. Luke 6:9; John 5:16-17). This is so in spite of the indignation of those who do not yet understand that "the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath', and that "the Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath' (Mark 2:27-28).</p>
      <p> 36.  In the Law and the prophets reference is made to the Sabbath (cf. Isa.66:23), Sabbaths (cf. Exod. 31:13) and Sabbaths of Sabbaths (cf. Lev. 16:31. LXX); and to circumcision and circumcision of circumcision (cf. Gen. 17:10-13); and to harvest (cf. Gen. 8:22) and harvest of harvest, as in the text, 'when you harvest</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts on Theology</p>
      <p> and the</p>
      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> your harvest' (cf Lev. 23:10). The texts about the Sabbath surely refer to the full attainment of practical, natural and theological philosophy; the texts about circumcision, to separation from things that are subject to generation and from the inner principles of these things: the texts about harvest, to the ingathering and enjoyment of more exalted spiritual principles on the part of the senses and the intellect. Through studying these three sets of texts the person of spiritual knowledge may discover the reasons why Moses, when he dies, takes his Sabbath rest outside the holy land (cf. Deut. 34:5), why Joshua carried out the circumcisions after crossing the Jordan (cf. Josh. 5:3), and why those who inherited the promised land brought to God the superabundant fruits of the double harvest (cf. Lev. 23:11).</p>
      <p> 37.  The Sabbath signifies the dispassion of the deiform soul that through practice of the virtues has utterly cast off the marks of sin.</p>
      <p> 38.  Sabbaths signify the freedom of the deiform soul that through the spiritual contemplation of created nature has quelled even the natural activity of sense-perception.</p>
      <p> 39.  Sabbaths of Sabbaths signify the spiritual calm of the deiform soul that has withdrawn the intellect even from contemplation of all the divine principles in created beings, that through an ecstasy of love has clothed it entirely in God alone, and that through mystical theology has brought it altogether to rest in God.</p>
      <p> 40.  Circumcision signifies the quelling of the soul's impassioned predilection for things subject to generation.</p>
      <p> 41.  Circumcision of circumcision signifies the complete discarding and stripping away also of even the soul's natural feelings for things subject to generation.</p>
      <p> 42.  Harvest signifies the deiform soul's ingathering and knowledge of the more spiritual principles of created beings in a manner conforming to both virtue and nature.</p>
      <p> 43.  Harvest of harvest signifies the apprehension of God which follows the mystical contemplation of noetic realities and which, inaccessible to all, is consummated in the intellect in a manner beyond understanding. Such apprehension is fittingly reaped by the person who in a worthy manner honors the Creator because of what He has created, whether visible or invisible.</p>
      <p> 44.   There is another more spiritual harvest, which is said to belong to God Himself; there is another more mystical circumcision.</p>
      <p> [V2] 123</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>

      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios First Century</p>
      <p> and there is another more hidden Sabbath, which God celebrates when he rests from his own labors. This is shown in the following texts: 'The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few' (Matt. 9:37). 'Circumcision of the heart m the spirit' (Rom. 2:29). and " God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it God rested from all the works He had begun to do' (Gen. 2:3. LXX).</p>
      <p> 45.  The harvest of God signifies the total dwelling and stability of the saints in God at the consummation of the ages.</p>
      <p> 46.   Circumcision of the heart in the spirit signifies the utter stripping away from the senses and the intellect of their natural activities connected with sensible and intelligible things. This stripping away is accomplished by the Spirit's immediate presence, which completely transfigures body and soul and makes them more divine.</p>
      <p> 47.  The Sabbath rest of God signifies the complete reversion of created bemgs to God. It is then that God suspends in created beings the operation of their natural energy by inexpressibly activating in them His divine energy. It is by virtue of this natural energy that each created being naturally acts: and God suspends its operation in each</p>
      <p> created being to the degree to which that being participates in His divine energy and so estabhshes its own natural energy within God Himself.</p>
      <p> 48. One should learn from those imbued with spiritual knowledge what is to be understood by the works which God began to do and what by those which He did not begin to do. For if He rested from all the works which He began to do, clearly He did not rest from those works which He did not begin to do. Perhaps, then, all that participates in being, such as the various essences of creatures, are works of God which began to be in time. For they have non-being as prior to their own being, since participant beings have not always existed. Participable beings in which participant beings participate by grace, such as goodness and all that is included in the principle of goodness, are perhaps works of God which did not begin to be in time. Briefly, these include all life, immortality, simplicity, immutability and infinity, and all the other qualities that contemplative vision perceives as substantively appertaining to God. These are works of God, yet not begun in time. For non-being is</p>
      <p> [V2] 124</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts on Theology</p>
      <p> and the</p>
      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios First Century</p>
      <p> never prior to goodness, nor to any of the other things we have listed, even if those things which participate in them do in themselves have a beginning m time. All goodness is without beginning because there is no time prior to it: God is eternally the unique author of its being.</p>
      <p> 49. God is infinitely above all beings, whether participant or participable. For whatever belongs to the category of being is a work of God, even though participant beings had a temporal origin, whereas participable beings were implanted by grace among things that come into existence in time. In this way participable beings are a kind of innate power clearly proclaiming God's presence in all things.</p>
      <p> 50.   All immortal things and immortality itself, all living things and life itself, all holy things and holiness itself, all good things and goodness itself, all blessings and blessedness itself, all beings and being itself are manifestly works of God. Some things began to be in time, for they have not always existed. Others did not begin to be in time, for goodness, blessedness, holiness and immortality have always existed. Those things which began in time exist and are said to exist by participation in the things which did not begin in time. For God is the creator of all life, immortality, holiness and goodness; and He transcends the being of all intelligible and describable beings.</p>
      <p> 51.  The sixth day of creation, accordmg to Scripture, represents the completion of the beings that are subject to nature. The seventh day marks the limit of the flow of temporal existence. The eighth day betokens the quality of that state which is beyond nature and time.</p>
      <p> 52.  He who observes the sixth day only according to the Law, fleeing the active, soul-afflicting domination of the passions, passes fearlessly through the sea to the desert (cf. Exod. 16:1): his Sabbath consists simply of rest from the passions. But when he has crossed the Jordan (cf. Josh. 3:17) and has left behind this state of simply resting from the passions, he enters into possession of the virtues.</p>
      <p> 53.  He who observes the sixth day according to the Gospel, having already put to death the first impulses of sin, through cultivating the virtues attains a state of dispassion which, like a desert, is bare of all evil: his Sabbath is a rest of his intellect even from the</p>
      <p> [V2] 125</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts on Theology</p>
      <p> and the</p>
      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> merest images suggested by the passions. But when he has crossed the Jordan he passes over into the land of spiritual knowledge, where the intellect, the temple mystically built by peace, becomes in spirit the dwellmg place of God.</p>
      <p> 54.   He who after the example of God has completed the sixth day with fitting actions and thoughts, and has himself with God's help brought his own actions to a successful conclusion, has in his understanding traversed the condition of all things subject to nature and time and has entered into the mystical contemplation of the eons and the things inherent in them; his Sabbath is his intellect's utter and incomprehensible abandonment and transcendence of created beings. But if he is also found worthy of the eighth day he has risen from the dead -that is, from all that is sequent to God, whether sensible or intelligible, expressible or conceivable. He experiences the blessed life of God, who is the only true life, and himself becomes god by deification.</p>
      <p> 55.  The sixth day is the complete fulfillment, on the part of those practicing the ascetic life, of the natural activities which lead to virtue. The seventh day is the conclusion and cessation, in those leading the contemplative life, of all natural thoughts about inexpressible spiritual knowledge. The eighth day is the transposition and transmutation of those found worthy into a state of deification. The Lord, giving perhaps a mysterious hint of the seventh and the eighth days, spoke of a day and an hour of consummation which encompasses the mysteries and the inner essences of all things. Apart from their Creator, the blessed Divinity Himself, there is no power whatsoever in heaven or on earth that can know that day and hour before the actual experience of them (cf. Matt. 24:36).</p>
      <p> 56.   The sixth day betokens the inner, essence of the being of created things. The seventh signifies the quality of the well-being of created things. The eighth denotes the inexpressible mystery of the eternal well-being of created things.</p>
      <p> 57.  Since we know that the sixth day is a symbol of practical activity, let us during this day fully discharge our debt of virtuous works, so that it may also be said of us, "And God saw everything He had made, and behold, it was very good' (Gen. 1:31).</p>
      <p> 58.   He who exerts himself bodily in order to adorn the soul with the manifold virtues pays to God the debt of good work that is required of him.</p>
      <p> [V2] 126</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts on Theology</p>
      <p> and the</p>
      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> 59.  He who has completed the sixth day, the day of preparation, in works of righteousness has crossed over to the repose of spiritual contemplation. During such contemplation his intellect, grasping in a divine manner the inner essences of created beings, ceases from all movement.</p>
      <p> 60.  He who for our sake shared in God's rest of the seventh day also for our sake participates in God's deifying energy on the eighth day, that is, in the mystical resurrection, and leaves lying in the sepulcher His linen clothes and the napkin that was about his head (cf John 20:6-7). Those who perceive this, like Peter and John, are convinced that the Lord has risen.</p>
      <p> 61.   The Lord's tomb stands equally either for this world or for the heart of each faithful Christian. The linen clothes are the inner essences of sensible things together with their qualities of goodness. The napkin is the simple and homogeneous knowledge of intelligible realities, together with the vision of God, in so far as it is granted. Through these things the Logos is initially recognized, for without them any higher apprehension of what He is would be altogether beyond our capacity.</p>
      <p> 62.  Those who bury the Lord with honor will also see Him risen with glory, but He is not seen by anyone else. For He can no longer be apprehended by His enemies as He does not wear those outer coverings through which He seemed to let Himself be captured by those who sought Him, and in which He endured suffering for the salvation of all.</p>
      <p> 63. He who buries the Lord with honor is revered by all who love God. For he has not allowed the Lord's body, nailed to the cross, to be left exposed to the blasphemy of unbelievers, but has befittmgly delivered Him from derision and insult. Those who sealed the tomb and set soldiers to watch (cf. Matt. 27:66) are hateful because of their scheming. When the Logos had risen, they slandered Him, saying that His body had been stolen away. In the same way, as they bribed the false disciple with silver to betray the Lord - by false disciple I mean a pretence of holiness for the sake of display - so they bribed the soldiers to make a false accusation against the risen Savior. Whoever possesses spiritual knowledge knows the significance of what has been said, for he is not ignorant of how and in how many ways the Lord is crucified, buried and rises again. Such a person makes corpses, as it were, of the impassioned</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts on Theology</p>
      <p> and the</p>
      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> thoughts which have been insinuated by the demons into his heart, and which through the temptations they suggest cut in pieces the qualities of moral beauty as if they were garments (cf Matt. 27:35): and he breaks like seals the impressions stamped deeply into his soul by the sins of prepossession.</p>
      <p> 64.  Whenever a lover of riches who feigns virtue by an outward show of devotion finds he has procured the material possessions he desires, he repudiates the way of Me that made people think he was a disciple of the Logos.</p>
      <p> 65.  When you see arrogant men not able to endure praise being given to others better than themselves, and contriving to suppress the truth by denying it with countless insinuations and baseless slanders, you must understand that the Lord is -again crucified by these men and buried and guarded with soldiers and seals. But the Logos rises afresh and puts them to confusion. The more the Logos is attacked, the more clearly He reveals Himself, as steeled in dis-passion through His sufferings. The Logos is stronger than all else: not only is He called truth but He is truth.</p>
      <p> 66.  The mystery of the incarnation of the Logos is the key to all the arcane symbolism and typology in the Scriptures, and in addition gives us knowledge of created things, both visible and intelligible. He who apprehends the mystery of the cross and the burial apprehends the inward essences of created things: while he who is initiated into the inexpressible power of the resurrection apprehends the purpose for which God first established everything.</p>
      <p> 67.  All visible realities need the cross, that is, the state in which they are cut off from things acting upon them through the senses. All intelligible realities need burial, that is, the total quiescence of the things which act upon them through the intellect. When all relationship with such things is severed, and their natural activity and stimulus is cut off, then the Logos, who exists alone in Himself, appears as if risen from the dead. He encompasses all that comes from Him, but nothing enjoys kinship with Him by virtue of natural relationship. For the salvation of the saved is by grace and not by nature (cf. Eph. 2:5).</p>
      <p> Ages, times and places belong to the category of relationship, and consequently no object necessarily associated with these things can be other than relative. But God transcends the category of relationship; for nothing else whatsoever is necessarily associated with</p>
      <p> [V2] 128</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts on Theology</p>
      <p> and the</p>
      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> Him. Therefore if the inheritance of the saints is God Himself, he who is found worthy of this grace will he beyond all ages, times and places: he will have God Himself as his place, in accordance with the text, 'Be to me a God who is a defender and a fortified place of my salvation' (Ps. 71:3. LXX).</p>
      <p> 69.  The consummation bears no resemblance whatsoever to the intermediary state, for otherwise it would not be a consummation. The intermediary state consists of everything that is sequent to the origin but falls short of the consummation. But if all ages, times and places, together with all that is necessarily associated with them, are sequent to God - since He is an unoriginate origin - and also fall far short of God - since He is an infinite consummation - then clearly they belong to the intermediary state. The consummation of those who are saved is God; in this supreme consummation no trace of the intermediary state will be observed in those who have been saved.</p>
      <p> 70.  The whole world, limited as it is by its own inner principles, is called both the place and age of those dwelling in it. There are modes of contemplation natural to it which are able to engender in created beings a partial understanding of the wisdom of God that governs all things. So long as they make use of these modes to gain understanding, they cannot have more than a mediate and partial apprehension. But when what is perfect appears, what is partial is superseded: all mirrors and indistinct images pass away when truth is encountered face to face (cf 1 Cor. 13:10-12). When he who is saved is perfected in God, he will transcend all worlds, ages and places in which hitherto he has been trained as a child.</p>
      <p> 71.  Pilate is a type of the natural law: the Jewish crowd is a type of the written law. He who has not risen through faith above the two laws cannot therefore receive the truth which is beyond nature and expression. On the contrary, he invariably crucifies the Logos, for he sees the Gospel either, like a Jew, as a stumbling-block or, like a Greek, as foolishness (cf. 1 Cor. 1:23).</p>
      <p> 72.  When you see Herod and Pilate making friends with each other in order to destroy Jesus (cf. Luke 23:12), you may discern in this the concurrence of the demons of unchastits' and self-esteem, who combine together to put to death the Logos of virtue and spiritual knowledge. For the demon of self-esteem, making a pretence of spiritual knowledge, refers to the demon of unchastity, and</p>
      <p> [V2] 129</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts on Theology</p>
      <p> and the</p>
      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> the demon of unchastity, putting on a hypocritical show of purity, refers back to the demon of self-esteem. Thus if is said, 'When Herod had arrayed Jesus m a gorgeous robe, he seat Him again to PilateXLuke 23:11).</p>
      <p> 73.  The intellect should not yield to the flesh or clmg to the passions. For, it is said, 'men do not gather figs from looms', that is, they do not gather virtue from the passions, 'nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush' (cf. Matt. 7:16), that is, they do not gather from the flesh that spiritual knowledge which gladdens the heart.</p>
      <p> 74.  An ascetic tested by the patient acceptance of trials and temptations, purified by bodily training, and perfected by attention to the higher forms of contemplation, receives the blessings of divine grace. "For the Lord', says Moses, 'came from Sinai." that is, from trials and temptations, 'and appeared to us from Seir,' that is, from bodily hardships, 'and hastened down from mount Paran with ten thousands of Kadesh' (Deut. 33:2. LXX), that is, from the mountain of faith with untold sacred knowledge.</p>
      <p> 75.  Herod exemplifies the will of the flesh; Pilate, the senses; Caesar, sensible things; and the Jews, the soul's thoughts. When the soul through ignorance associates with sensible things, it betrays the Logos into the hands of the senses to be put to death and proclaims within itself the kingship of perishable things. For the Jews say, 'We have no king but Caesar' (John 19:15).</p>
      <p> 76.  Again, Herod exemplifies the activity of the passions; Pilate, a disposition that is deluded by them; Caesar, the ruler of the world of darkness; and the Jews, the soul. When the soul submits to the passions and betrays virtue into the power of an evil disposition, it manifestly denies the kingdom of God and transfers itself to the destructive tyranny of the devil.</p>
      <p> 77.  The subjugation of the passions is not sufficient to ensure spiritual happiness for the soul unless the soul also acquires the virtues by keeping the commandments. Scripture says, 'Do not rejoice because the spirits are subject to you,' that is, the operations of the passions, but 'because your names are written in heaven' (Luke 10;20), having been transferred to the place of dispassion by the grace of sonship gained through the virtues.</p>
      <p> 78.  Whoever possesses spiritual knowledge must always possess as well a rich store of virtue gained through his conduct. Scripture</p>
      <p> [V2] 130</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts on Theology</p>
      <p> and the</p>
      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios First Century</p>
      <p> says, 'He who has a purse,' that is, spiritual knowledge, 'let him take it, and his knapsack as well' (Luke 22:36), that is, the stoic from which he liberally nourishes his soul with virtue. He who does not have a purse and a knapsack, that is, knowledge and virtue, 'let him sell his garment and buy a sword"  (ibid.).  By this Scripture means: let him</p>
      <p> give his own flesh wiUingly to labors in pursuit of virtue, and for the sake of the peace of God let him wisely wage war against passions and demons, that is, let him acquire the skill of discriminating in the word of God between the lower and the higher.</p>
      <p> 79. The Lord appeared when He was thirty years old, and with this number secretly teaches those with discernment the mysteries relating to Himself. For, mystically understood, the number thirty presents the Lord as the Creator and provident ruler of time, nature, and the intelligible realities that lie beyond visible nature. The number seven signifies that He is the Creator of time, for time has a sevenfold character. The number five signifies that He is the Creator of nature, for nature has a fivefold character because of the fivefold division of the senses. The number eight signifies that He is the Creator of intelligible realities, for intelligible realities come into being outside the cycle that is" measured by time. And the number ten signifies that He is the provident ruler, because it is the ten holy commandments that lead men towards perfection, and also because the symbol for ten^ is the first letter of the name taken by the Lord when He became man. By adding up five, seven, eight and ten you obtain the number thirty. Thus he who truly knows how to follow the Lord as his master will understand why, should he attain the age of thirty, he will also be empowered to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom. For when through his ascetic practice he has irreproachably created the world of the virtues as if it were a world of visible nature, not allowing his soul to be diverted from its course by the hostile powers as he passes through time; and when he unerringly gathers spiritual knowledge through contemplation, and is providentially able to engender the same state in others, then he himself, whatever his physical age, is thirty years old in spirit and makes manifest in others the power of the blessings which he himself possesses.</p>

      <p> 80. He who yields to the pleasures of the body is neither diligent in virtue nor readily receptive of spiritual knowledge. For this reason he has no one - that is, no mtelligent thought - to put him into the pool when the</p>
      <p> water is disturbed (cf. John 5:7), that is, into a state of virtue capable of receiving spiritual knowledge and of healing every sickness. On the contrary, although sick, he procrastinates because of laziness and is forestalled by someone else, who prevents him from being cured. And so he lies there with his illness for thirty-eight years. He who does not contemplate the visible creation so as to discern God's glory in it, and does not reverently raise his inner vision to the noetic world, quite fittingly remains ill for the number of years specified. For the number thirty, understood with reference to nature, signifies the sensible world, while with reference to the ascetic life it signifies the practice of the virtues. The number eight, understood mystically, denotes the intelligible nature of incorporeal beings, while understood in terms of spiritual knowledge it denotes the supreme wisdom of theology. Whoever does not advance towards God by these means remains paralyzed until the Logos comes to teach him how he can obtain prompt healing, saying to him, 'Rise, take up your bed and walk' (John 5:8); that is to say, the Logos commands him to upraise his intellect from the love of pleasure which dominates him, to shoulder the body of the virtues and to go home, that is, to heaven. Better that the higher should raise the lower up to virtue on the shoulders of ascetic practice than that, through soft living, the lower should drag the higher down into self-indulgence.</p>
      <p> 81.   Until our minds in purity have transcended our own being and that of all things sequent to God, we have not yet acquired a permanent state of holiness. When this noble state has, by means of love, been established in us, we shall know the power of the divine promise. For we must believe that where the intellect, taking the lead, has by means of love rooted its power, there the saints will find a changeless abode. He who has not transcended himself and all that is in any way subject to intellection, and has not come to abide in the silence beyond intellection, cannot be entirely free from change.</p>
      <p> 82.  Every intellection has either a multiple or at least a dual aspect. For it is an intermediate relationship between two extremes - an intellective being and an intelligible being - and links the one to the other. Hence neither extreme can possess an absolute</p>

      <p> simplicity. An intellective being is a subject/and so the capacity of apprehending some intelligible object is necessarily associated with it. And an intelligible being necessarily either is a subject or exists in a subject: as a subject it possesses the intrinsic capacity of being apprehended by an intellective being; as existing in a subject it presupposes a being in which it exists potentially. For no creature is in itself a simple being or intellection, in such a way as to constitute an indivisible unity. Thus, if we call God a being, then the capacity to be apprehended by a process of intellection is not inherent in His nature, for if it were He would be composite. Or if we call Him an intellection, then He does not possess an essence with a natural capacity for being an intellective subject, but He Himself is intellection in His very essence; the whole of God is intellection and intellection alone. But in terms of intellection He is also being: the whole of God is being and being alone. And yet the whole of God is beyond being and beyond intellection, because He is an indivisible unity, simple and without parts. Thus whoever, to whatever degree, still apprehends by means of intellection has not yet transcended duality. But he who has advanced altogether beyond intellection, and has renounced it because he has transcended it, has come to dwell to some extent in unity.</p>
      <p> 83. In the multiplicity of beings there is diversity, dissimilarity and difference. But in God, who is in an absolute sense one and alone, there is only identity, simplicity and similarity. It is therefore not safe to devote oneself to the contemplation of God before one has advanced beyond the multiplicity of beings. Moses showed this when he pitched the tent of his mind outside the camp (cf. Exod. 33:7) and then conversed with God. For it is dangerous to attempt to utter the inexpressible by means of the spoken word, for the spoken word involves duality or more than duality. The surest way is to contemplate pure being silently in the soul alone, because pure being is established in undivided unity and not among the multiplicity of things. The high priest, who was commanded to go into the holy of holies within the veil only once every year (cf. Lev. 16; Heb. 9:7), shows us that only he who has passed through what is immaterial and holy and has entered the holy of holies - that is, who has transcended the whole natural world of sensible and intelligible realities, is free from all that is specific to creatures and whose mind is unclad and naked - is able to attain the vision of God.</p>

      <p> 84.   When Moses pitches his tent outside the camp (cf. Exod. 33:7) - that is, when he estabhshes his wiU and mind outside the world of visible things - he begins to worship God. Then, entering into the darkness (cf. Exod. 20:21) - that is, into the formless and immaterial realm of spiritual knowledge - he there celebrates the most sacred rites.</p>
      <p> 85.  The darkness is that formless, immaterial and bodiless state which embraces the knowledge of the prototypes of all created things. He who like another Moses enters into it, although mortal by nature, understands things that are immortal. Through this knowledge he depicts in himself the beauty of divine excellence, as if painting a picture which is a faithful copy of archetypal beauty. Then he comes down from the mountain and offers himself as an example to those who wish to imitate that excellence. In this way he manifests the love and generosity of the grace he has received.</p>
      <p> 86.  Those who apply themselves with a pure heart to divine philosophy derive the greatest gain from the knowledge it contains. For their will and purpose no longer change with circumstances, but readily and with firm assurance they undertake all that conforms to the standard of holiness.</p>
      <p> 87.  Baptized in Christ through the Spirit, we receive the first m-corruption accordmg to the flesh. Keepmg this original mcorruption spotless by giving ourselves to good works and by dying to our own will, we await the final mcorruption bestowed by Christ in the Spirit. No one who possesses this final incorruption fears the loss of the blessings he has obtained.</p>
      <p> 88.  When God in His mercy resolved to send down from heaven the grace of His divine power to us on earth. He established the sacred tabernacle with all its contents as a symbolical image, type and imitation of wisdom.</p>
      <p> 89.  The grace of the New Testament is mystically hidden in the letter of the Old. That is why St Paul says that 'the Law is spiritual" (Rom. 7:14). Thus the letter of the Law, superseded, grows old and decays (cf. Heb. 8:13), while its spirit, perpetually renewed, stays young. For grace is altogether immune from decay.</p>
      <p> 90.  The Law is the shadow of the Gospel. The Gospel is the image of the blessings held in store. The Law checks the actualization of evil. The Gospel brings about the realization of divine blessings.</p>

      <p> 9L All sacred Scripture can be divided into flesh and spirit as if it were a spiritual man. For the literal sense of Scripture is flesh and its inner meaning is soul or spirit. Clearly someone wise abandons what is comiptible and unites his whole being to what is incorruptible.</p>
      <p> 92.  The Law is the flesh of the spiritual man who here corresponds to sacred Scripture: the prophets are the senses; the Gospel is the noetic soul that functions through the flesh of the Law and the senses of the prophets, revealing its power in its actions.</p>
      <p> 93.  The Law is a shadow and the prophets are an image of the divine and spiritual blessings contained in the Gospel. The truth itself, foreshadowed in the Law and prefigured in the prophets, is revealed in the Gospel as now present to us through actual events.</p>
      <p> 94.  He who fulfils the Law in his private and public life only abstains from the actual commission of sin, sacrificing to God the outward fulfillment of his mindless passions. He is satisfied with this manner of seeking salvation because of his spiritual immaturity.</p>
      <p> 95.  He 'who has been trained by the prophets' words not only refrains from the outward fulfillment of the passions but also renounces all assent to them in his soul. He is not content simply to appear to abstain from sin in the inferior part of himself, the flesh, while secretly allowing its free rein in his superior part, the soul.</p>
      <p> 96.  He who has truly embraced the life of the Gospel has made himself immune to both the promptings and performance of evil, and pursues every virtue in action and thought. He offers a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving (cf. Ps.  116:17), for he has been set free from all disturbance produced by the passions and</p>
      <p> liberated from mental warfare against them: and he feeds his soul with the hope of the blessings held in store, his one unquenchable delight.</p>
      <p> 97. To the more diligent students of Holy Scripture the Lord is clearly shown as having two forms. The first is common and more popular, and it can be perceived by many. The text 'We saw Him and He had no comeliness or beauty' (Isa. 53:2. LXX) refers to this form. The second is more hidden, and it can be perceived only by a few, that is, by those who have already become like the holy apostles Peter and John, before whom the Lord was transfigured with a glory that overwhelmed the senses (cf. Matt. 17:2). The</p>

      <p> Written for Thalassios</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> text 'Thou art fairer than the children of men' (Ps. 45:2) refers to this form. The first of these two forms is consonant to beginners; the second to those perfected in spiritual knowledge, in so far as such perfection is possible. The first is an image of the Lord's mitial advent, to which the literal meaning of the Gospel refers, and which by means of suffering purifies those practicing the virtues. The second prefigures the second and glorious advent, in which the spirit of the Gospel is apprehended, and which by means of wisdom transfigures and deifies those imbued with spiritual knowledge: because of the transfiguration of the Logos within them 'they reflect with unveiled face the glory of the Lord' (2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
      <p> 98.  He who endures suffering for the sake of virtue, without being shaken in his resolve, is inspired by the first advent of the Logos, which cleanses him from all defilement. He who through contemplation has raised his intellect to the angelic state possesses the power of the second advent, which produces in him dispassion and incorruptibility.</p>
      <p> Freedom from sense-perception pertains to the contemplative who draws his intellect away from the flesh and the world and concentrates it on God. The first, in his ascetic struggle to loosen the natural bond linking the soul to the flesh, constantly submits his will to the hardships he undergoes. The second, who has broken that bond through contemplation, is not held back by anything at all: he has already freed himself from the domination of those who try to overpower him.</p>
      <p> 100.The manna which was given to Israel in the desert (cf. Exod. 16:14-35) is the Logos of God. Those who eat it find that it supplies every spiritual delight. It is blended to suit every taste in accordance with the different desires of those who eat it, for it has the quality of every kind of spiritual food. Thus, to those who through the Spirit have been bom from above by means of incorruptible seed (cf John 3:3-5), it comes as pure spiritual milk (cf. 1 Pet. 2:2); to the weak it comes as vegetables (cf. Rom. 14:2) sustaining the soul's passible aspect; to those in whom the soul's organs of perception have been trained by long practice to distinguish between good and evil it serves as solid food (cf. Heb. 5:14). The Logos of God also has other infinite powers which cannot be encompassed in this world. If at death a man is worthy to be put in</p>

      <p> charge of many things or all things because in this world he has been faithful in small things (cf Matt. 25:21), he will also receive all or some of these other powers of the Logos.

      <p> 1. God is one because there is one Divinity: unoriginate, simple, beyond being, without parts, indivisible. The Divinity is both unity and trinity - wholly one and wholly three. It is wholly one in respect of the essence, wholly three in respect of the hypostases or persons. For the Divinity is Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and is in Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The whole Divinity is in the whole Father and the whole Father is in the whole Divinity. The whole Divinity is in the whole Son and the whole Son is in the whole Divinity. The whole Divinity is m the whole Holy Spirit and the whole Holy Spirit is in the whole Divinity. The whole Divinity is both Father and in the whole Father; the whole Father is in the whole Divinity and the whole Divinity is the whole Father. The whole Son is in the whole Divinity and the whole Divinity is in the whole Son; the whole Son is both the whole Divinity and in the whole Divinity. The whole Divinity is both the Holy Spirit and in the whole Holy Spirit; and the whole Holy Spirit is both the whole Divinity and in the whole Divinity. For the Divinity is not partially in the Father, nor is the Father part of God. The Divinity is not partially in the Son, nor is the Son part of God. The Divinity is not partially in the Holy Spirit, nor is the Holy Spirit part of God. For the Divinity is not divisible; nor is the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit incomplete God. On the contrary, the whole and complete Divinity is completely in the complete Father; the whole and complete Divinity is completely in the complete Son; and the whole and complete Divinity is completely in the complete Holy Spirit. For the whole Father is completely in the whole Son and Spirit; and the whole Son is completely in the whole Father and Spirit; and the whole Holy Spirit is completely in the whole Father and Son. Therefore the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are one God. The essence, power and energy of the Father, the Son and the</p>

      <p> Holy Spirit are one, for none of the hypostases or persons either exists or is inteUigible without the others.</p>
      <p> 2.  Every inteUection involves both an intellect that apprehends and an intelligible being that is apprehended. But God is neither an apprehending intellect nor an intelligible being: He transcends both. For if He were an apprehending intellect He would be limited by His need for a relationship with an intelligible being: and if He were an intelligible being He would be limited because naturally subject to an apprehending intellect capable of grasping Him. It follows therefore that God is not to be conceived as either an intellect or an intelligible being, and that He is beyond both intellection and intelligibility. Intellection and intelligibility appertain by nature to what is sequent to God.</p>
      <p> 3.  Every intellection inheres as a quality in an apprehending being; and its activity is directed towards a being endowed with qualities. For no intellection can be directed towards a being that is absolutely independent, simple and self-subsistent, since the intellection itself is not independent and simple. But God is in both respects absolutely simple: in so far as He is being. He is independent of any apprehending subject; in so far as He is intellection. He is independent of any apprehensible object. Thus God is neither an intelligible object nor an intellective subject, for He clearly transcends both being and intellection.</p>
      <p> 4.  The centre of a circle is regarded as the indivisible source of all the radii extending from it; similarly, by means of a certain simple and indivisible act of spiritual knowledge, the person found worthy to dwell in God will perceive pre-existmg in God all the inner essences of created things.</p>
      <p> 5.  When intellection is given form through its apprehension of intelligible objects, it ceases to be single and becomes many intellections; for it is marked by the form of each intelligible object that it apprehends. But as it passes beyond the multiplicity of the sensible and intelligible things that in this way confer their manifold forms upon it, it becomes altogether free from form. It is now that the Logos, who is beyond intellection, unites Himself to it and makes it His own, givmg it rest from those things which by nature change and diversity it with the many conceptual forms that they impose upon it. He who experiences this has rested from his works, just as God did from His (cf Gen. 2:2; Heb. 4:10).</p>

      <p> 6.  He who reaches such perfection as is attainable by men in this world offers to God the fruits of love, joy, peace and long-suffering (cf Gal. 5:22), and will in the age to be offer those of incorruptibility, eternity and similar gifts. The first qualities may be found in the man perfect in the practice of virtues; the second in the man who through trae spiritual knowledge has passed beyond the world of created things.</p>
      <p> 7.  Just as the result of disobedience is sin, so the result of obedience is virtue. And just as disobedience leads to breaking the commandments and to separation from Him who gave them, so obedience leads to keeping the commandments and to union with Him who gave them. Thus he who through obedience has kept the commandments has achieved righteousness and, moreover, he has not cut himself off from union in love with Him who gave them; and the opposite is equally true.</p>
      <p> 8.  If you are healed of the breach caused by the fall, you are severed first from the passions and then from impassioned thoughts. Next you are severed from nature and the inner principles of nature, then from conceptual images and the knowledge relating to them. Lastly, when you have passed through the manifold principles relating to divine providence, you attain through unknowing the very principle of divine unity. Then the intellect contemplates only its own immutability, and rejoices with an unspeakable joy because it has received the peace of God which transcends all intellect and which ceaselessly keeps him who has been granted it from falling (cf Phil. 4:7).</p>
      <p> 9.   Fear of hell causes beginners to shun evil. Desire to be rewarded with divine blessings confers on those who are advancing a readiness to practice the virtues. But the mystery of love transcends all created beings and makes the intellect blind to all that is sequent to God. Only upon those who have become blind to all that is sequent to Him does the Lord bestow wisdom, showing them what is more divine.</p>
      <p> 10.  The Logos of God is like a grain of mustard seed (cf. Matt. 13:31): before cultivation it looks extremely small, but when; cultivated in the right way it grows so large that the highest principles of both sensible and intelligible creation come like birds to revive themselves in it. For the principles or inner essences of all things are embraced by the Logos, but the Logos is not embraced by any</p>

      <p> thing. Hence the Lord has said that he who has faith as a grain of mustard seed can move a mountain by a word of command (cf. Matt. 17:20), that is, he can destroy the devil's dominion over us and remove it from its foundation.</p>
      <p> 11.  The grain of mustard seed is the Lord, who by faith is sown spiritually in the hearts of those who accept Him. He who diligently cultivates the seed by practicing the virtues moves the mountain of earth-bound pride and, through the power he has gained, he expels from himself the obdurate habit of sin. In this way he revives in himself the activity of the principles and qualities or divine powers present in the commandments, as though they were birds.</p>
      <p> 12.  Let us build on the Lord, as though on a foundation of faith, with gold, silver and precious stones, raising a temple of holiness (cf. 1 Cor. 3:12). Let us build, that is to say, with pure undebased theology, with a way of life that is lucid and radiant, with divine thoughts and conceptual images more precious than jewels. Let us not use wood, hay or stubble, that is, idolatry - which is a passionate desire for sensible things - or a meaningless way of life, or thoughts which are impassioned and as empty of wise understanding as straw.</p>
      <p> 13.  If a man seeks spiritual knowledge, let him plant the foundations of his soul immovably before the Lord, in accordance with God's words to Moses: 'Stand here by Me' (Deut. 5:31). But it should be realized that there are differences among those who stand before the Lord, as is clear from the text, "There are some standing here who will not taste death till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power' (Mark 9:1). For the Lord does not always appear in glory to all who stand before Him. To beginners He appears in the form of a servant (cf. Phil. 2:7); to those able to follow Him as He climbs the high mountain of His transfiguration He appears in the form of God (cf. Matt. 17: 1-9), the form in which He existed before the world came to be (cf. John 17:5). It is therefore possible for the same Lord not to appear in the same way to all who stand before Him, but to appear to some in one way and to others in another way, according to the measure of each person's faith.</p>
      <p> 14.  When the Logos of God becomes manifest and radiant in us, and His face shines like the sun, then His clothes will also look white (cf. Matt. 17:2). That is to say, the words of the Gospels</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts on Theology</p>
      <p> and the</p>
      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios Second Century</p>
      <p> will then be clear and distinct with nothing concealed. And Moses said Elijah - the more-spiritual principles of the Law and the prophets - will also be present with Him.</p>
      <p> 15.  It is written that the Son of Man is coming 'with His angels in the glory of the Father' (Matt. 16:17). Similarly, in those found worthy, the Logos of God is transfigured to the degree to which each has advanced in holiness, and He comes to them with His angels in the glory of the Father. For the more spiritual principles in the Law and the prophets - symbolized by Moses and Elijah when they appeared with the Lord at His transfiguration -manifest their glory according to the actual receptive capacity of those to whom it is revealed.</p>
      <p> 16.  He who to some degree has been initiated into the inner principle of the divine unity invariably discovers the inner principles of divine providence and judgment conjoined with it. That is why, like St Peter, he thinks it good that three tabernacles should be made withm himself for those who have appeared to him (cf. Matt. 17:4). These tabernacles represent three stages of salvation, namely that of virtue, that of spiritual knowledge and that of theology. The first requires fortitude and self-restraint in the practice of the virtues: of this the type was Elijah. The second requires right discernment in natural contemplation: Moses disclosed this in his own person. The third requires the consummate perfection of wisdom: this was revealed by the Lord. They were called tabernacles, or temporary dwellings, because beyond them there are other still more excellent and splendid stages, through which those found worthy will pass in the age to be.</p>
      <p> 17.  A man engaged in the practice of the virtues is said to be "sojourning' in the flesh (cf. Gen. 12:10), for by practicing the virtues he is severing the soul's relationship with the flesh and stripping from himself the deceit of material things. A man of spiritual knowledge is said to be sojourning in virtue itself, for he still contemplates the trath indistinctly, as though in a mirror (cf. 1 Cor. 13:12): he has not yet enjoyed a face-to-face vision of the self-subsistent forms of goodness, seeing them as they are in them-selves. For as regards the blessings of the age to be, every saint does no more than walk in the image of them, crying, 'I am a stranger and a sojourner as all my fathers were' (Ps. 39:12).</p>
      <p> 18.  He who prays must never stand still on the steep ascent that</p>

      <p> Written for Thalassios</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> leads to God. just as he has to progress upwards from strength to strength in the practice of the virtues (cf. Ps. 84:5-7) and to rise in his contemplation of spiritual truths from glory to glory (cf. 2 Cor. 3:18), and to pass from the letter to the spirit of Holy Scripture, so he must advance in a similar manner within the realm of prayer. He must raise his intellect and the resolve of his soul from what is human to what is divine, so that his intellect can follow Jesus the Son of God, who has passed through the heavens (cf. Heb. 4:14) and who is everywhere. For He has passed through all things for us by the dispensation of His incarnation, so that we, by following Him, may pass through all that is sequent to Him and so come to be with Him, provided we apprehend Him not according to the limitations to which He accommodated Himself in His incarnation but according to the majesty of His natural infinitude.</p>
      <p> 19.  We should always devote ourselves to God and seek Him out as we have been commanded (cf. Matt. 6:33). Although when we seek Him in this present stage of life we cannot come to the limit of His depth, yet perhaps if we penetrate His depth even slightly we shall contemplate what is more holy than the holy and more spiritual than the spiritual. The high priest shows this to us typologically when he goes from the holy place, which is holier than the court, into the holy of holies, which is holier than the holy place (cf. Lev. 16).</p>
      <p> 20.   The whole Logos of God is neither diffuse nor prolix but is a unity embracing a diversity of principles, each of which is an aspect of the Logos. Thus he who speaks about the truth, however fully he deals with his subject, speaks always about the one Logos of God.</p>
      <p> 21.   Since Christ is God and the Logos of the Father, 'the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily in Him' in a manner that is according to essence (Col. 2:9). The fullness of the Godhead dwells in us by grace when we gather into ourselves all virtue and wisdom, a wisdom which, so far as this is possible in man, does not in any way fall short of a faithful imitation of the divine archetype. For it is not incongruous that, by virtue of our relationship with the Logos, the fullness of the Godhead, embracing a diversity of spiritual principles, should come to dwell</p>
      <p> also in us.</p>
      <p> 22.  The thought which springs naturally from our intellect is a messenger of the intellect's hidden activity. Similarly He who is in essence the Logos of God and knows the Father as a thought knows</p>

      <p> the intellect which conceives it, reveals the Father whom He knows, no creature being able to approach the Father without Him. That is why he is called 'Messenger of great counsel' (Isa. 9:6 LXX).</p>
      <p> 23.   The great counsel of God the Father is the unspoken and unknown mystery of the divine dispensation. This the only-begotten Son revealed through His incarnation, when He became the Messenger of the great pre-etemal counsel of God the Father. He who knows the inner principle of the mystery becomes a messenger of the great counsel of God, and he is exalted unceasingly by action and thought through all things until he encounters Him who has to a corresponding degree descended towards him.</p>
      <p> 24.   The Logos of God providentially descended for our sakes into the lower parts of the earth, and also ascended far above all the heavens (cf. Eph. 4:9-10), even though by nature He is entirely unmoving. Since through the incarnation the Logos has already accomplished in Himself as man all that is to be, let him who delights in spiritual knowledge rejoice inwardly as he considers the consummation promised to those who love the Lord.</p>
      <p> 25.  If the divine Logos of God the Father became son of man and man so that He might make men gods and the sons of God, let us believe that we shall reach the realm where Christ Himself now is: for He is the head of the whole body (cf. Col. 1:18), and endued with our humanity has gone to the Father as forerunner on our behalf. God will stand 'm the midst of the congregation of gods' (Ps. 82:1. LXX) - that is, of those who are saved -distributing the rewards of that realm's blessedness to those found worthy to receive them, not separated from them by any space.</p>
      <p> 26. He who still satisfies the impassioned appetites of the flesh dwells in the land of the Chaldeans as a maker and worshipper of idols. But when he has begun to discern what the situation is and has gained some insight into the mode of life which nature demands, he leaves the land of the Chaldeans and comes to Haran in Mesopotamia (cf. Gen. 11:31). By Haran I mean that intermediate state between virtue and vice - a state not yet purified from the delusion of the senses. But if he goes beyond that moderate understanding of goodness which he has attained through the senses, he will hasten towards the blessed land, that is, to the state free from all sin and ignorance which God, who does not lie, manifests to those who love Him, promising to give it to them as a reward for their virtue.</p>

      <p> 27.   If for our sakes the Logos of God "died on the Cross in weakness" and was raised 'by the power of God' (2 Cor. 13:4), then in a spiritual sense He is always doing and suffering this on our account, becoming all things to all men so that He might save all men (cf 1 Cor. 9:22). Thus, since the Corinthians were weak, while with them St Paul rightly "decided to know nothing except Jesus Christ and Him crucified" (1 Cor. 2:2). But since the Ephesians were perfect, he wrote to them that God 'has raised us up in union with Christ Jesus and enthroned us with Him in the heavenly realm' (Eph. 2:6), thus affirming that the Logos of God adapts Himself according to each person's strength. In this way. He is crucified for those taking their first steps in the ascetic life, and He nails their impassioned energies to the cross with divine fear. He rises again and ascends into heaven for those who have put off the whole of their fallen selfhood, corrupted by the desires of deceitfulness (cf. Eph. 4:22); who have been entirely renewed through the Holy Spirit as man created in the image of God (cf. Eph. 4:24); and who draw near to the Father through His grace which is in them, and so are raised 'far above every principality, power, might and dominion, and above every name that is named not only in this age but also in the age to come' (Eph. 1:21). For all things, all names and dignities sequent to God, are likewise inferior to him who through grace dwells in God.</p>
      <p> 28.  Before His visible advent in the flesh the Logos of God dwelt among the patriarchs and prophets in a spiritual manner, prefiguring the mysteries of His advent. After His incarnation He is present in a similar way not only to those who are still beginners, nourishing them spiritually and leading them towards the maturity of divine</p>
      <p> perfection, but also to the perfect, secretly pre-delineating in them the features of His future advent as if in an</p>
      <p> 29. Just as the teachings of the Law and the prophets, being harbingers of the coming advent of the Logos in the flesh, guide our souls to Christ (cf Gal. 3:24), so the glorified incarnate Logos of God is Himself a harbinger of His spiritual advent, leading our souls forward by His own teachings to receive His divine and manifest advent. He does this ceaselessly, by means of the virtues converting those found worthy from the flesh to the spirit. And He will do it at the end of the age, making manifest what has hitherto been hidden from all men.</p>

      <p> 30.  As long as I remain imperfect and refractory, neither obeying God by practicing the commandments nor becoming perfect in spiritual knowledge, Christ from my point of view also appears imperfect and refractory because of me.: For I diminish and cripple Him by not growing in spirit with Him, since I am "the body of Christ and one of its members' (1 Cor. 12:27).</p>
      <p> 31.  'The sun rises and the sun sets', says Scripture (Eccles. 1:5). Likewise the Logos appears sometimes as risen and sometimes as set, depending on the manner of life and the spiritual status and essence or quality of those pursuing virtue and searching for divine knowledge. Blessed is he who like Joshua (cf Josh. 10:12-13) keeps the Sun of righteousness from setting in himself throughout the whole day of this present life, not allowing it to be blotted out by the dusk of sin and ignorance. In this way he will truly be able to put to flight the cunning demons that rise up against him.</p>
      <p> 32.  When the Logos of God is raised up in us by our practice of the virtues and by contemplation. He draws all things to Himself (cf. John 12:32); He sanctifies in virtue and spiritual knowledge our thoughts and words about the flesh, the soul and the nature of beings: He sanctifies also the very members of our bodies and our senses, and He places them all under His yoke. So let the visionary of divine things eagerly ascend in pursuit of the Logos until he reaches the place where He is. For, as Ecclesiastes puts it. He "draws to His place' (Eccles. 1:5) all those who follow Him, and as the great High Priest He brings them into the Holy of Holies, where He</p>
      <p> Himself, who became as we are, has entered as a forerunner on our behalf (cf. Heb. 6:20).</p>
      <p> 33. He who devoutly strives to attain wisdom and is on his guard against the invisible powers, should pray that both natural discrimination - whose light is but limited - and the illuminating grace of the Spirit abide with him. The first by means of practice trains the flesh in virtue, the second illuminates the intellect so that it chooses above all else companionship with wisdom; and through wisdom it destroys the strongholds of evil and pulls down "all the self-esteem that exalts itself against the knowledge of God' (2 Cor. 10:5). Joshua exemplifies this both when he prays for the sun to stand still upon Gibeon, that is, for the light of the knowledge of God to remain unsetting as it shines for him over the mountain of spiritual contemplation; and when he asks for the moon to stand still in</p>

      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>

      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios Second Century</p>
      <p> the valley, that is, for the natural discrimination which watches over the weak flesh to remain changelessly wedded to virtue (cf Josh. 10:12-13).</p>
      <p> 34.  Gibeon is the spiritual intellect. The valley is the flesh humbled by death. The sun is the Logos, who illumines the intellect, supplying it with the power of contemplation and delivering it from all ignorance. The moon is the natural law, which persuades the flesh duly to submit to the spirit and accept the yoke of the commandments. The moon is the symbol of nature because of its mutability; but among the saints it remains immutable, for in them the state of virtue is unchanging.</p>
      <p> 35.  Those who seek the Lord should not look for Him outside themselves; on the contrary, they must seek Him within themselves through faith made manifest in action. For He is near you: 'The word is ... in your mouth and in your heart, that is, the word of faith' (Rom. 10:8) - Christ being Himself the word that is sought.</p>
      <p> 36.   When we think of the height of God's infinity we should not despair of His compassion reaching us from such a height; and when we recall the infinite depth of our fall through sin we should not refuse to believe that the virtue which has been killed in us will rise again. For God can accomplish both these things: He can come down</p>
      <p> and illumine our intellect with spiritual knowledge, and He can raise up the virtue within us and exalt it with Himself through works of righteousness. For it is written: 'Do not say in your heart, 'Who shall ascend into heaven?' - that is, to bring Christ down - or, 'Who shall descend into the depths?" - that is, to bring Christ up again from the dead' (Rom. 10:6-7). Interpreted in another way, the depths stand for all that is sequent to God, in the whole of which the whole divine Logos providentially comes to dwell, as life returning to what is dead. For all things whose life depends upon their participation in life are in themselves dead. And heaven stands for God's natural hiddenness, whereby He is incomprehensible to all things. Alternatively, if anyone explains heaven as the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, and the depths as the mystery of the incarnation, he will not, I think, be far from the mark. For it is hard to grasp the meaning of either doctrine through rational demonstration; or rather, their meaning is altogether inaccessible unless explored with faith.</p>
      <p> 37.  In the life of ascetic practice the Logos, adapted to the cor-</p>

      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> poreal action of the virtues, becomes flesh (cf John 1:14). In the contemplative life the Logos, refined by conceptual images that are spiritual, becomes what He was in His principial state, the Logos that was God and was with God (cf John 1:1-2).</p>
      <p> 38.  If you expound the teaching of the Logos from the standpoint of the moral life, using relatively materialistic words and examples which correspond to the capacity of your hearers, you make the Logos flesh. Conversely, if you elucidate mystical theology by means of the higher forms of contemplation you make the Logos spirit.</p>
      <p> 39.   If you theologize in an affirmative or cataphatic manner, starting from positive statements about God, you make the Logos flesh, for you have no other means of knowing God as cause except from what is visible and tangible. If you theologize in a negative or apophatic manner, through the stripping away of positive attributes, you make the Logos spirit or God as He was in His principial state with God: starting from absolutely none of the things that can be known, you come in an admirable way to know Him who transcends unknowing.</p>
      <p> 40.  When like the patriarchs we learn to dig wells of virtue and spiritual knowledge within ourselves by means of ascetic practice and contemplation, we will find within us Christ the spring of life (cf. Gen. 26:15-18). Wisdom commands us to drink from this spring, saying, 'Drink water from your own pitchers and from the spring of your own wells' (Prov. 5:15). If we do this we shall find that the treasures of wisdom truly are within us.</p>
      <p> 41.  Those who animal-like live solely according to the senses make the Logos flesh for themselves in a dangerous way: they misuse God's creation in order to indulge the passions. They do not understand the principle of that wisdom which is revealed to all: that we should know and praise God through His creation and that by means of the visible world we should understand whence we came, what we are, for what purpose we were made and where we are going. On the contrary, they travel through this present age in darkness, fumbling with both hands merely their ignorance of God.</p>
      <p> 42.  Those who abide solely by the letter of Holy Scripture and tie down the dignity of the soul to the external worship of the Law make the Logos flesh for themselves in a reprehensible manner. They think that God will be pleased with sacrifices of dumb animals. They</p>

      <p> Written for Thalassios Second Century</p>
      <p> pay much attention to the body with outward purifications but neglect the soul's beauty, stained as it is by the passions. But it was for the soul that every power of the visible world was brought forth and that every divine teaching and law was proclaimed.</p>
      <p> 43. 'For the fall and resurrection of many in Israel is the Lord appointed', says the Holy Gospel (Luke 2:34). We should ask consequently whether He may not be appointed for the fall of those who contemplate the visible creation solely according to the senses and of those who stick to the mere letter of Holy Scripture, not being able in their folly to go further and grasp the new spirit of grace. And we should ask whether He may not be appointed for the resurrection of those who contemplate God's creatures and listen to His words in a spiritual manner, cultivating in appropriate ways only the divine image that is within the soul.</p>
      <p> 44.  If the Lord's being appointed for the faU and resurrection of many is understood in the right way, then the faU will refer to that of the passions and of evil thoughts in each of the faithful, and the resurrection to that of the virtues and of every thought that enjoys God's blessing.</p>
      <p> 45.   Those who think of the Lord only as the creator of things which are generated and which decay mistake Him, as Mary Magdalene did, for the gardener. It is therefore for their own good that the Master avoids contact with such persons, saying, 'Do not touch Me' (John 20:17); for they are not yet capable of ascending with Him to the Father. He knows that those who are predisposed to think of Him in such mean terms will suffer harm if they draw near to Him.</p>
      <p> 46.  The people assembled in Galilee in the upper room with the doors locked for fear of the Jews are those who, having safely reached the height of divine contemplation in the land of revelations and having shut their senses like doors for fear of the spirits of evil, receive the presence of the divine Logos of God in a way that cannot be conceived. He is revealed to them without the activity of their senses; through His words 'Peace be with you' He bestows dispassion on them, and breathing on them He grants them participation in the Holy Spirit, giving them power to combat evil spirits and showing them the signs of His mysteries (cf John 20:19-22; Mark 16:17-18).</p>
      <p> 47.   The Lord does not ascend to the Father for those who explore [V2] 149</p>

      <p> divine truth with their faculties as they are in their fallen state; but He does ascend to the Father for those who seek out the truth in the Spirit by means of the higher forms of contemplation. The Logos came down out of love for us. Let us not keep Him down permanently, but let us go up with Him to the Father, leaving the earth and earthly things behind, lest He say to us what He said to the Jews because of their stubbornness: 'I go where you cannot come' (John 8:21). For without the Logos it is impossible to approach the Father of the Logos.</p>
      <p> 48.  The land of the Chaldeans is a way of life dominated by the passions, in which the idols of sins are fashioned and worshipped. Mesopotamia, the land between the rivers, is a way of life that vacillates between opposites. The promised land is a state filled with every blessing. Everyone, then, who like ancient Israel neglects this state, loses the freedom which he has been granted, and allows himself once more to be dragged off into slavery to the passions.</p>
      <p> 49.  It should be noted that none of the saints went down to Babylon of his own accord. For it would be inept and inane for those who love God to choose what is bad rather than what is good. If some of them were taken there by force along with the people (cf. 2 Kings 25, 2 Chron. 36), they are to be understood as those who, not premeditatedly but at a time of crisis, and for the sake of saving those who needed their help, abandoned their absorption in the higher principle of spiritual knowledge in order to give instruction concerning the passions. For this reason St Paul felt that he would be more useful if he was in the flesh - that is, engaged in giving moral instruction to the disciples - although his whole desire was to be set free from moral teaching and to be with God (cf. Phil. 1:23) through pure intellectual contemplation which transcends the world.</p>
      <p> 50.  When Saul was being choked by an evil spirit, David sang to the accompaniment of the harp and gave him relief (cf 1 Sam. 16:14-23). In a similar manner every spiritual discourse, sweetened with mystical contemplation, brings relief to the intellect possessed by evil spirits and frees it from the bad conscience which chokes it.</p>
      <p> 51 David's glowing complexion and beautiful eyes (cf. 1 Sam. 16:12. LXX) signify a man in whom the splendor of a holy way of life is enriched by the presence of the principle of spiritual</p>

      <p> Written for Thalassios Second Century</p>
      <p> knowledge. In this state ascetic practice and contemplation go together. Ascetic practice is given luster by the qualities of the virtues: contemplation is illumined by divine conceptual images.</p>
      <p> 52.   The reign of Saul is an image of the external worship of the Law, which the Lord abolished because it perfected nothing. 'For the Law', says Scripture, 'made nothing perfect' (Heb. 7:19). But the reign of the great David prefigures the worship set forth m the Gospel, for it enshrines to perfection God's most intimate purposes.</p>
      <p> 53.  Saul is the natural law originally established by the Lord to rule over nature. But Saul was disobedient: he spared Agag, king of Amaiek (cf 1 Sam. 15:8 - 16:13), that is, the body, and slipped downward into the sphere of the passions. He was therefore deposed so that David might take over Israel. David is the law of the Spirit -the law engendering that peace which so excellently builds for God the temple of contemplation.</p>
      <p> 54.  Samuel signifies obedience to God. So long as the principle of obedience exercises its priest-like office within us, even though Saul spares Agag - that is, the earthly will - yet that principle in its zeal will put him to death (cf. 1 Sam. 15:33): it strikes the sin-incited intellect and puts it to shame for having transgressed the divine ordinances.</p>
      <p> 55.  When the intellect scorns the teaching which purifies it from the passions, and ceases to examine what should be done and what should not be done, it will through ignorance inevitably be overcome by the passions. As the intellect gradually comes to be separated from God, it is more and more involved in difficulties not of its own choosing. Obeying the demons, it makes a god of the belly and tries to find relief there from what oppresses it. Let Saul convince you of the truth of this: because he did not take Samuel for an adviser in all things he inevitably turned to idolatry, putting his trust in a ventriloquist and consulting her as if she were a god (cf. 1 Sam. 28 : 7-20).</p>
      <p> 56.  He who asks to receive his daily bread (cf. Matt. 6:11) does not automatically receive it in its fullness as it is in itself: he receives it according to his own capacity as recipient. The Bread of Life (cf. John 6:35) gives Himself in His love to all who ask, but not in the same way to all: for He gives Himself more fully to those who have performed great acts of righteousness, and in smaller measure to</p>
      <p> [V2]151</p>

      <p> and the</p>
      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios Second Century</p>
      <p> those who have not achieved so much. He gives Himseh'to each person according to that person's spiritual ability to receive Him.</p>
      <p> 57.   Sometimes the Lord is absent from us; at other times He is present within us. He is absent when we contemplate Him indistinctly, as though in a mirror. He is present within us when we contemplate Him face to face (cf. 1 Cor. 13:12).</p>
      <p> 58.  For the man living the life of ascetic practice the Lord is present through the virtues; but He is absent from the man who does not bother about virtue. Similarly, for a man engaged in the contemplative life. He is present in genuine knowledge of created beings, but absent when there is some lapse from this.</p>
      <p> 59.  When a man passes from the life of ascetic practice to the stage of spiritual knowledge, he is absent from the flesh (cf. 2 Cor. 5:8). Caught up as on clouds by the more lofty conceptual images into the translucent air of mystical contemplation, he is able to 'be with the Lord for ever' (1 Thess. 4:17). A man 'is absent from the Lord' (2 Cor. 5:6) if he is not yet able to contemplate his conceptual images of things with a pure intellect free from the operations of the senses (so far as this is possible), and if he cannot yet embrace the knowledge of the Lord in its true simplicity, without the help of symbols.</p>
      <p> 60.   The Logos of God is called flesh not only inasmuch as He became incarnate, but in another sense as well. When He is contemplated in His true simplicity, in His prmcipial state with God the Father (cf. John 1:1-2), although He embraces the models of the truth of all things in a distinct and naked manner. He does not contain within Himself parables, symbols and stories needing allegorical interpretation. But when He draws near to men who cannot with the naked intellect come into contact with noetic realities in their naked state. He selects things which are familiar to them, combining together various stories, symbols, parables and dark sayings; and in this way He becomes flesh. Thus at the first encounter our intellect comes into contact not with the naked Logos but with the incarnate Logos, that is, with various sayings and stories. The incarnate Logos, though Logos by nature, is flesh in appearance. Hence most people think they see flesh and not the Logos, although in fact He is the Logos. The intellect-that is, the inner meaning-of Scripture is other than what it seems to most people. For the Logos becomes flesh in each of the recorded sayings.</p>

      <p> 61.   The initial stages of learning about religious devotion are naturally related to the flesh. For in our first encounter with religion we come into contact with the letter and not the spirit. But as we get nearer to the spirit and refine the materiality of words with the more subtle forms of contemplation, we come to dwell - so far as this is possible for man — purely in the pure Christ, so that we can say with St Paul, 'Though we have known Christ according to the flesh, now we no longer know Him in this manner' (2 Cor. 5:16). That is to say, we no longer know Him according to the flesh because, through the intellect's naked encounter with the Logos stripped of the veils covering Him, we have advanced from knowing Him according to the flesh to knowing His 'glory as of the only-begotten Son of the Father' (John 1:14).</p>
      <p> 62.  He who is living the life in Christ has gone beyond the righteousness of both the Law and nature. This St Paul indicated when he said, 'For in Christ Jesus there is neither circumcision nor uncircumcision' (cf. Gal. 5:6). By circumcision he meant righteousness according to the Law; by uncircumcision he hinted at natural justice, or equity.</p>
      <p> 63.   Some are reborn through water and the spirit (cf. John 3:5); others receive baptism in the Holy Spirit and in fire (cf. Matt. 3:11). 1 take these four things - water, spirit, fire and Holy Spirit - to mean one and the same Spirit of God. To some the Holy Spirit is water because He cleanses the external stains of their bodies. To others He is simply spirit because He makes them active in the practice of virtue. To others He is fire because He cleanses the interior defilement which lies deep within their souls. To others, according to Daniel, He is Holy Spirit because He bestows on them wisdom and spiritual knowledge (cf. Dan. 1:17; 5:11-12). For the single identical Spirit takes His different names from the different ways in which He acts on each person.</p>
      <p> 64.  The Law instituted the Sabbath, says Scripture, so that your ox and your servant might rest (cf. Exod. 20:10). Both of these are symbols for the body. For the person engaged in the practice of the virtues, the body is an ox under the yoke of his intellect: it is forced to bear the burdens imposed in the ascetic life through the exercising of the virtues. For the contemplative the body is the servant of his intellect, because through contemplation it is now endowed with intelligence and so serves the intellect's spiritual commands</p>

      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios Second Century</p>
      <p> intelligently. For both the ox and the servant the Sabbath signifies the final goal pursued by them throughout the ascetic and the contemplative life, and so it provides for both of them a fitting rest.</p>
      <p> 65.  The man who attains virtue together with a consonant spiritual knowledge treats his body as an ox: with his intelligence he steers it to do what has to be done. The life of active virtue is his servant - the life which naturally gives rise to virtue and which is acquired through the exercise of discrimination as if bought with money. The Sabbath is a virtuous, dispassionate and peaceful condition of both body and soul. It is an unchanging state.</p>
      <p> 66.  For those still mainly concerned with the bodily forms of virtue, the Logos of God becomes hay and straw, sustaining the passible aspect of their souls and guiding it to the service of the virtues. For those who have advanced to the true contemplation of divine things, the Logos is bread, sustaining the intellective aspect of their souls and guiding it to a godlike perfection. That is why we find the patriarchs on their journeys providing themselves with bread and their asses with fodder (cf Gen. 24:25: 42:25, 27). For the same reason the Levite in the Book of Judges said to the old man who questioned him in the street of Gibeah: 'There is bread for us and fodder for our asses, and for your servants there is no lack of anything' (cf. Judges 19:19).</p>
      <p> 67.  In Scripture the Logos of God is called and actually is dew (cf. Deut. 32:2), water, spring (cf. John 4:14) and river (cf. John 7:38), according to the subjective capacity of the recipient. To some He is dew because He quenches the burning energy of the passions which assails the body from without. To those seared in the depths of their being by the poison of evil He is water, not only because water through antipathy destroys its opposite but also because it bestows a vivifying power conducive to well-being. To those in whom the fountain of contemplative experience is continually active He is a spring bestowing wisdom. To those from whom flows the true teaching about salvation. He is a river copiously watering men, domestic animals, wild beasts and plants. That is to say, those who have remained human are uplifted by the conceptual images they have been given and are so deified: those made like domestic animals by the passions are restored to the human state by being shown the exact character of the virtuous way of life and so they recover their natural intelligence; those made like wild beasts by</p>

      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> evil habits and actions are tamed by kind and tender counsel and return to their natural gentleness; those hardened like plants against divine blessings are made pliable by the Logos passing deeply through them, and they regain the sensitivity that enables them to bear fruit and to sustain the Logos within them.</p>
      <p> 68.   The Logos of God is the way (cf John 14:6) for those who run the course of virtue in their ascetic life nobly and vigorously, swerving neither to the right through self-esteem, nor to the left through proclivity to the passions, but directing their steps in accordance with God's will. Asa, king of Judah, did not persevere in this to the end and so it is said that in his old age he suffered from his feet (cf. 1 Kings 15:23), because he faltered in running the race of his life accordmg to God's will.</p>
      <p> 69.   The Logos of God is called the door (cf. John 10:9) because He leads to spiritual knowledge those who, in their unsullied pursuit of the ascetic life, have nobly traversed the whole way of the virtues, and because He reveals, as does light, the lustrous treasures of wisdom. For He Himself is the way, the door, the key and the kingdom. He is the way because He guides; He is the key because He both opens and is opened to those found worthy to receive divine blessings; He is the door because He gives admittance; He is the kingdom because He is inherited and because He enters by participation into all things.</p>
      <p> 70.  The Lord is called light, life, resurrection and truth (cf. John 8:12; 11:25; 14:6). He is light because He gives lucidity to the soul, dispels the darkness of ignorance, illumines the intellect so that it can grasp what is unutterable, and reveals mysteries perceptible only to the pure. He is life because He gives souls who love Him the activity proper to the divine realm. He is resurrection because He raises the intellect from its lethal attachment to material things and purifies it from all decay and mortality. He is truth because He gives to those found worthy an unchanging state of sanctity.</p>
      <p> 71.  The divine Logos of God the Father is mystically present in each of His commandments. God the Father is by nature present entirely and without division in His entire divine Logos. Thus, he who receives a divine commandment and carries it out receives the Logos of God who is in it; and he who receives the Logos through the commandments also receives through Him the Father who is by nature present in Him, and the Spirit who likewise is by nature in</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>

      <p> and the</p>
      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios Second Century</p>
      <p> Him. 'I tell you truly, he that receives whomever 1 send receives Me; and he that receives Me receives Him that sent Me" (John 13:20). In this way, he who receives a commandment and carries it out receives mystically the Holy Trinity.</p>
      <p> 72.  It is not the man who worships God with words alone who glorifies God in himself but he who for God's sake bears hardship and suffermg in the quest for virtue. Such a man is glorified in return by God with the glory that is in God, receiving through participation the grace of dispassion as a reward for virtue. For everyone living the life of ascetic practice who glorifies God in himself by suffering for the sake of virtue is himself glorified in God through the dispassionate illumination of divine realities perceived during contemplation. For the Lord said as He drew near to His passion, 'Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him. If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself; and He will glorify Him at once' (John 13:31-32). From this it is clear that divine gifts follow sufferings endured for the sake of virtue.</p>
      <p> 73.  So long as we only see the Logos of God as embodied multifariously in symbols in the letter of Holy Scripture, we have not yet achieved spiritual insight into the incorporeal, simple, single and unique Father as He exists in the incorporeal, simple, single and unique Son, according to the saying, 'He who has seen Me has seen the Father . . . and 1 am in the Father and the Father in Me" (John 14:9-10). We need much knowledge so that, having first penetrated the veils of the sayings which cover the Logos, we may with a naked intellect see - in so far as men can - the pure Logos, as He exists in Himself, clearly showing us the Father in Himself. Hence a person who seeks God with true devotion should not be dominated by the literal text, lest he unwittingly receives not God but things appertaining to God; that is, lest he feel a dangerous affection for the words of Scripture instead of for the Logos. For the Logos eludes the intellect which supposes that it has grasped the incorporeal Logos by means of His outer garments, like the Egyptian woman who seized hold of Joseph's garments instead of Joseph himself (cf Gen. 39:7-13), or like the ancients who were content merely with the beauty of visible things and mistakenly worshipped the creation instead of the Creator (cf. Rom. 1:25).</p>
      <p> 74.  It is by means of the more lofty conceptual images that the inner principle of Holy Scripture can be stripped gradually of the</p>

      <p> complex garment of words with which it is physically draped. Then to the visionary intellect - the intellect which through the total abandonment of its natural activities is able to attain a glimpse of the simplicity that in some measure discloses this principle - it reveals itself as though in the sound of a delicate breeze. This was the case with Elijah, who was granted such a vision in the cave of Horeb (cf. 1 Kgs. 19:12). Horeb signifies fallow land just broken up, which is the firm possession of the virtues established through the new spirit of grace. The cave is the hidden sanctuary of wisdom within the intellect: he who enters it will mystically perceive the spiritual knowledge that is beyond perception, in which God is said to dwell. Therefore everyone who like Elijah truly seeks God will not only arrive at Horeb - that is, not only will he through ascetic practice attain the state of virtue - but will also enter the cave at Horeb - that is, as a contemplative he will enter into that hidden sanctuary of wisdom found only by those who have attained the state of virtue.</p>
      <p> 75.  When our intellect has shaken off its many opinions about created things, then the inner principle of truth appears clearly to it, providing it with a foundation of real knowledge and removing its former preconceptions as though removing scales from the eyes, as happened in the case of St Paul (cf. Acts 9:18). For an understanding of Scripture that does not go beyond the literal meaning, and a view of the sensible world that relies exclusively on sense-perception, are indeed scales, blinding the soul's visionary faculty and preventing access to the pure Logos of truth.</p>
      <p> 76.   The Apostle Paul says that he had a partial knowledge of the Logos (cf. 1 Cor. 13:9). The Evangelist John states that he has seen His glory: 'For we beheld His glory,' he says, 'the glory as of the only-begotten Son of the Father, full of grace and truth' (John 1:14). Perhaps St Paul says that he has but a partial knowledge of the divine Logos because the Logos is known from His energies only to a limited degree, while knowledge of Him as He is in essence and person is altogether inaccessible to all angels and men alike. St John, who was initiated</p>
      <p> as perfectly as a man can be into the mystery of the incarnation of the Logos, said that he saw .the glory of the Logos as flesh, that is, he saw the purpose for which God, full of grace and truth, became man. For not as God in His essence and as coessential with God the Father was the only-begotten Son given to</p>

      <p> Written for Thalassios</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> us: only inasmuch as by virtue of God's providential dispensation He became man by nature and, for our sakes made coessential with us. He was given to us who have need of such grace. And from His fullness we always receive the grace which corresponds to each step we take along the spiritual path. Thus he who has kept the inner principle of things perfectly pure within himself will acquire the glory, full of grace and truth, of the Logos of God made flesh for us, who through His coming glorified and sanctified Himself in His human nature for our sake. For 'when He appears,' says Scripture, "we shall be like Him" (1 John 3:2).</p>
      <p> 77.  So long as the soul advances "from strength to strength' (Ps. 84:7) and "from glory to glory' (2 Cor. 3:18), that is, so long as it advances from one degree of virtue to a greater degree and from one level of spiritual knowledge to a higher level, it remains a 'sojourner', one who has no permanent home, as in the saying, "My soul has long been a sojourner" (Ps. 120:6. LXX). For great is the distance and many are the levels of knowledge through which the soul must pass before it reaches "the place of the miraculous tabernacle, the house of God itself, with the voice of exultation and thanksgiving, and the sound of feasting" (Ps. 42:4. LXX). It advances continually from one hymn of praise to another, from one level of divine contemplation to another, full of joy and thankfulness for what it has already seen. For all those who have received the Spirit of grace into their hearts celebrate in this festive manner, crying 'Abba, Father" (Gal. 4:6).</p>
      <p> 78.  'The place of the miraculous tabernacle' is a dispassionate and untroubled state of virtue in which the Logos of God adorns the soul like a tabernacle with the varied beauties of the virtues. "The house of God" is spiritual knowledge compounded of many different forms of contemplation when God dwells in a soul, filling it from the bowl of wisdom. "Exultation" is the soul's leap of joy at the riches of the virtues. 'Thanksgiving" is gratitude for the bountiful outpouring of wisdom. "The sound of feasting" is the unceasing mystical hymn of glory, which</p>
      <p> exultation and thanksgiving combine to form.</p>
      <p> 79. The man who has struggled bravely with the passions of the body, has fought ably against unclean spirits, and has expelled from his soul the conceptual images they provoke, should pray for a pure heart to be given him and for a spirit of integrity to be renewed within him (cf Ps. 51:10). In other words, he should pray that by</p>

      <p> grace he may be completely emptied of evil thoughts and filled with divine thoughts, so that he may become a spiritual world of God. splendid and vast, wrought from moral, natural and theological forms of contemplation.</p>
      <p> !0. He who has made his heart pure will not only know the inner essences of what is sequent to God and dependent on Him but, after passing through all of them, he will in some measure see God Himself, which is the supreme consummation of all blessings. When God comes to dwell in such a heart. He honors it by engraving His own letters on it through the Holy Spirit, just as He did on the Mosaic tablets (cf. Exod. 31:18). This He does according to the degree to which the heart, through practice of the virtues and contemplation, has devoted itself to the admonition which bids us, in a mystical sense, 'Be fruitful and multiply" (Gen. 35:11).</p>
      <p> ) 1. A pure heart is perhaps one which has no natural propulsion towards anything in any manner whatsoever. When in its extreme simplicity such a heart has become like a writing-tablet beautifully smoothed and polished. God comes to dwell in it and writes there His own laws.</p>
      <p> 82.  A pure heart is one which offers the mind to God free of all image and form, and ready to be imprinted only with His own archetypes, by which God Himself is made manifest.</p>
      <p> 83.  According to the text, "But we have the intellect of Christ' (1 Cor. 2:16), the saints are said to receive Christ's intellect. But this does not come to us through the loss of our own intellectual power: nor does it come to us as a</p>
      <p> supplementary part added to our intellect: nor does it pass essentially and hypostatically into our intellect. Rather, it illumines the power of our intellect with its own quality and conforms the activity of our intellect to its own. In my opinion the person who has Christ's intellect is he whose intellection accords with that of Christ and who apprehends Christ through all things.</p>
      <p> 84. According to the text, "We are the body of Christ and each of us is one of its members' (cf. 1 Cor. 12:27), we are said to be the body of Christ. We do not become this body through the loss of our own bodies: nor again because Christ's body passes into us hypostatically or is divided into members: but rather because we conform to the likeness of the Lord's flesh by shaking off the corruption of sin. For just as Christ in His manhood was sinless by nature both</p>

      <p> Written for Thalassios Second Century</p>
      <p> in flesh and in soul, so we too who believe in Him, and have clothed ourselves in Him through the Spirit, can be without sin in Him if we so choose.</p>
      <p> 85.  According to Scripture there are temporal ages in themselves, and temporal ages which encompass the consummation of other ages. This is clear from the text: 'But now once at the consummation of the ages . . .' (Heb. 9:26). Again there are other ages or eons, free of a temporal nature, after this temporal age established at the consummation of the ages. This is shown by the text:'. . . so that in the ages to come He might display the overflowing richness . . .' (Eph. 2:7). But we also find in Scripture a large number of past, present and future ages: there are references to 'ages of ages' (Ps. 84:4. LXX), 'age of age' (Ps. 9:12. LXX), 'agelong times' (2 Tim. 1:9) and 'generations joined together by the ages' (Gen. 9:12). But now lest we digress too far from our subject by expounding what Scripture means by temporal ages or agelong times or generations, and by explaining what are merely ages, what are ages of ages, and what is simply age, and age of age, let us leave these matters to the researches of scholars and return to the theme of our chapters.</p>
      <p> this thing exists but it has not specified what it is, as the foUowing text shows: 'The Lord rules the age, and above the age, and for ever" (Exod. 15:18. LXX). There is therefore something above the age, namely the inviolate kingdom of God. For it is not right to say that the kingdom of God had a beginnmg or that it was preceded by ages or by time. We believe the kingdom to be the inheritance of those who are saved, their abode and their place, as the true Logos has taught us. For it is the final goal of those who long for that which is the desire of all desires. Once they have reached it they are granted rest from all movement whatsoever, as there is no longer any time or age through which they need to pass. For after passing through all things they will come to rest in God, who exists before all ages and whom the nature of ages cannot attain.</p>
      <p> 87. Even though a man attains the highest degree of ascetic practice and contemplation possible in this earthly life, yet so long as he is still in this life he will possess spiritual knowledge, the power to prophesy and the pledge of the Holy Spirit only in part, not in their fullness. But when he comes, beyond the limit of the ages, to that</p>

      <p> perfect inheritance in which those found worthy behold the truth face to face and as it really is (cf 1 Cor. 13:12), he will no longer have only a part of the fullness but will acquire by participation the whole fullness of grace. For, as St Paul says, all who are saved will attain perfect manhood, according to 'the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ' (Eph. 4:13), in whom all the treasures of wisdom and spiritual knowledge are hidden (cf Col. 2:3). When these things are revealed, what is partial will cease to exist.</p>
      <p> i.  Some seek to discover what the state of perfection of the saints in the kingdom of God is like. Does it involve progress and change or is it a fixed condition? In what way must bodies and souls be thought to exist? Speaking conjecturally, one may suggest a parallel between the life of the body and that of the soul. In the case of physical life the reason for taking food is twofold: first for growth and second for sustenance when we have already grown up. Until we reach physical maturity we feed ourselves in order to grow; but when the body reaches its full stature it is fed no longer for growth but for sustenance. In the same way the reason for nourishing the soul is also twofold. While it is advancing along the spiritual path it is nourished by virtue and</p>
      <p> contemplation, until it transcends all created things and attains 'the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ' (Eph. 4:13). Once it has entered this state it ceases from all increase and growth nourished by indirect means and is nourished directly, in a manner which passes understanding. Having now completed the stage of growth, the soul receives the kind of incorruptible nourishment which sustains the godlike perfection granted to it, and receives a state of eternal well-being. Then the infinite splendors inherent in this nourishment are revealed to the soul, and it becomes god by participation in divine grace, ceasing from all activity of intellect and sense, and at the same time suspending all the natural operations of the body. For the body is deified along with the soul through its own corresponding participation in the process of deification. Thus God alone is made manifest through the soul and the body, since their natural properties have been overcome by the superabundance of His glory.</p>
      <p> 89. Some scholars try to discover how the eternal dwelling-places and things promised differ from each other. Is there a difference in their actual locality? Or does the difference arise from our conception of the spiritual quality and quantity peculiar to each dwelling-</p>

      <p> Written for Thalassios</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> place? Some think the first and some the second. He who knows the meaning of "The kingdom of God is within you' (Luke 17:21), and 'In my Father's house are many dwelling-places' (John 14:2), will prefer the second explanation.</p>
      <p> 90. Some try to discover how the kingdom of heaven differs from the kingdom of God. Is there a difference in their actual nature, or is the difference a conceptual one? The answer is that they do not differ in their actual natures, but merely in our conception of them. The kingdom of heaven consists in possessing an inviolate and pre-etemal knowledge of created things through perceiving their inner essences as they exist in God. The kingdom of God is the imparting through grace of those blessings which pertain naturally to God. The first concerns the consummation of created things, the second our conception of their state after they reach their consummation.</p>
      <p> 91.  The text, 'The kingdom of heaven has drawn near' (Matt. 3:2: 4:17), does not in my judgment imply any temporal limitation. For the kingdom 'does not come in a way that can be observed: one cannot say, "Look, it is here" or "Look, it is there" ' (Luke 17:20-21). The phrase has reference to the relationship which the saints have with the kingdom, each according to his or her inner state. For 'the kingdom of God', says Scripture, 'is within you" (Luke 17:21).</p>
      <p> 92.  The kingdom of God the Father is present in all believers in potentiality; it is present in actuality in those who, after totally expelling all natural life of soul and body from their inner state, have attained the life of the Spirit alone and are able to say, "1 no longer live, but Christ lives in me" (Gal. 2:20).</p>
      <p> 93.   Some say that the kingdom of heaven is the way of life which the saints lead in heaven: others that it is a state similar to that of the angels, attained by those who are saved; others that it is the very form of the divine beauty of those who 'wear the image of Him who is from heaven" (1 Cor. 15:49). In my judgment each of these three views is correct. For the grace of the kingdom is given to all according to the quality and quantity of the righteousness that is in. them.</p>
      <p> 94.   So long as we are manfully engaged in the holy warfare of ascetic or practical philosophy we retain with us the Logos, who in the form of the commandments came from the Father into this world. But when we are released from our ascetic struggle with the passions and are declared victor over both them and the demons, we</p>
      <p> [V2] 162</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Two Hundred Texts on Theology</p>
      <p> and the</p>
      <p> Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God</p>
      <p> Written for Thalassios</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> pass, by means of contemplation, to gnostic philosophy; and in this way we allow the Logos mystically to leave the world again and make His way to the Father. Hence it is that the Lord says to His disciples: "You have loved Me and have believed that 1 come from God. 1 came from the Father and have come into the world; again 1 leave the world and make My way to the Father" (John 16:27-28). By the world He meant perhaps the hard task of practicing the virtues; by the Father, that intellectual state which transcends the world and is free from all material propensity. When we are in this state the Logos of God enters into us, putting an end to our battle with the passions and the</p>
      <p> demons.</p>
      <p> 95.   He who through practice of the virtues has succeeded in mortifying whatever is earthly in him (cf Col. 3:5), and who by fulfilling the commandments has triumphed over the world of the passions within him, will experience no more affliction: for he will have already left the world and come to be in Christ, the conqueror of the world of the passions and the source of all peace. He who has not severed his attachment to material things will always experience affliction, smce his state of mind depends on things that are naturally changeable, and so it alters when they do. But he who has come to be in Christ will be totally impervious to such material change. That is why the Lord says, 'I have said these things to you, so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will experience affliction; but have courage, for I have overcome the world' (John 16:33). In other words, "In Me, the Logos of virtue, you have peace, for you have been released from the swirl and turmoil of material passions and objects; in the world - that is, in a state of attachment to material things - you are afflicted because of the successive changes of these things.' For both he who practices the virtues and he who loves the world experience affliction, the first because of the toil which such practice entails and the second because of the futility of material things. But the affliction of the first is salutary, that of the second corrupting and destructive. The Lord gives release to both: in the case of the first He allays the toil of ascetic practice with the contemplation attained through dispassion, and in the case of the second He rescinds attachment to corrupted things by means of repentance.</p>
      <p> 96.  The charge made against the Savior in the inscription on the Cross clearly showed that He who was crucified was Lord and king</p>

      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> of practical, natural and theological philosophy. For Scripture says that the inscription was written in Latin, Greek and Hebrew (cf. John 19:20). I take Latin to signify the practical branch of philosophy, since according to Daniel (cf. Dan. 2:40) the Roman empire was appointed to be the most resolute and manful of all the kingdoms on earth; for the distinguishing feature of the practice of the virtues, or practical philosophy, is resolution and manfulness, I take</p>
      <p> Greek to signify natural contemplation, since the Greek nation more than any other people has pursued natural philosophy. I take Hebrew to signify initiation into the mysteries of theology, since this nation was from the beginning clearly consecrated to God through the patriarchs.</p>
      <p> 97.  We must not only put bodily passions to death but also destroy the soul's impassioned thoughts. Hence the psalmist says, "Early in the morning I destroyed all the wicked of the earth, that I might cut off all evil-doers from the city of the Lord" (Ps. 101:8) -that is, the passions of the body and the soul's godless thoughts.</p>
      <p> 98.   If we keep the path of virtue undefiled through devout and true knowledge, and do not deviate to either side, we will experience the advent of God revealed to us because of our dispassion. For 'I will sing a psalm and in a pure path I will understand when Thou wilt come to me' (cf. Ps. 101:1-2). The psalm stands for virtuous conduct; understanding indicates the spiritual knowledge, gained through virtue, by means of which we perceive God's advent, when we wait for the Lord vigilant in the virtues.</p>
      <p> 99.  He who is a beginner on the spiritual way must not be brought to practice the commandments by kindness alone, but must more often be induced to continue the struggle by being rigorously reminded of God's judgment, in this way he will not only be moved by love to desire what is divine, but will be moved by fear to avoid what is evil. For 'I will sing to Thee, 0 Lord, of mercy and judgment' (Ps. 101:1. LXX). He will sing to God charmed by love, and steeled by fear he will have strength for the song.</p>
      <p> 100.He who through virtue and spiritual knowledge has brought his body into harmony with his soul has become a harp, a flute and a temple of God. He has become a harp by preserving the harmony of the virtues: a flute by receiving the inspiration of the Spirit through divine contemplation: and a temple by becoming a dwelling place of the Logos through the purity of his intellect.</p>

Its principle of being, together with the mode, the nature and the quality of its being, is altogether inaccessible to creatures. For it eludes every intellection of intellective beings, in no way issuing from its natural hidden inwardness, and infinitely transcendmg the summit of all spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 2.  The substantive and essential Good is that which has no origin, no consummation, no cause of being and no motion whatsoever, so far as its being is concerned, towards any final cause. The goodness to which such terms apply is not substantive since it has an origin, a consummation, a cause of being, and motion, so far as its being is concerned, towards some final cause. Even if what is not being in the substantive sense is said to be, it exists and is said to be by participation, through the will of substantive being.</p>
      <p> 3.  Not only is the divine Logos prior to the genesis of created beings, but there neither was nor is nor will be a principle superior to the Logos. The Logos is not without intellect or bereft of life; He possesses intellect and life because the Father is the essentially subsistent intellect that begets Him, and the Holy Spirit is His essentially subsistent and coexistent life.</p>

      <p> 4.  There is one God, because the Father is the begetter of the unique Son and the fount of the Holy Spirit: one without confusion and three without division. The Father is unoriginate Intellect, the unique essential Begetter of the unique Logos, also unoriginate, and the .fount of the unique everlasting life, the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> 5.  There is one God because there is one Divinity, a Unity un-riginate, simple, beyond being, without parts and undivided. The same Unity is a Trinity, also unoriginate, simple and so on.</p>
      <p> 6.  Everything that derives its existence from participation in some other reality presupposes the ontological priority of that other reality. Thus it is clear that the divine Cause of created beings -which derive their existence from participation in that Cause - is incomparably superior to all such beings in every way, since by nature its existence is prior to theirs and they presuppose its onto-logical priority. It does not exist as a being with accidents, because if that were the case the divine would be composite, its own existence receiving completion from the existence of created beings. On the contrary, it exists as the beyond-beingness of being. For if artists in their art conceive the shapes of those things which they produce, and if universal nature conceives the forms of the things within it, how much more does God Himself bring into existence out of nothing the very being of all created things, since He is beyond being and even infinitely transcends the attribution of beyond-beingness. For it is He who has yoked the sciences to the arts so that shapes might be devised; it is He who has given to nature the energy which produces its forms, and who has established the very is-ness of beings by virtue of which they exist.</p>
      <p> participate in Him according to some other mode, never issues from the hiddenness of His essence; for even that mode according to which He wills to be participated in remains perpetually concealed from all men. Thus, just as God of His own will is participated in - the manner of this being known to Him. alone - in the surpassing power of His good-ness. He freely brings into existence participating beings, according to the principle which He alone understands. Therefore what has come mto being by the will of Him who made it can never be co-etemal with Him who willed it to exist.</p>
      <p> 8.    The divine Logos, who once for all was bom in the flesh.</p>
      <p> [V2]166</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> always in His compassion desires to be bom in spirit in those who desire Him. He becomes an infant and moulds Himself in them through the virtues. He reveals as much of Himself as He knows the recipient can accept; He does not diminish the manifestation of His own greatness out of lack of generosity but estimates the receptive capacity of those who desire to see Him. In this way the divine Logos is eternally made manifest m different modes of participation, and yet remains etemally invisible to all in virtue of the surpassing nature of His hidden activity. That is why the apostle, when wisely considering the power of this hidden activity, says, 'Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and throughout the ages' (Heb. 13:8); for he sees the hidden activity as something which is always new and never becomes outmoded through being embraced by the intellect.</p>
      <p> 9.   Christ our God is bom and becomes man by adding to Himself flesh endowed with an intellective soul. He who from non-being brings created things into being is Himself bom supranaturally of a Virgin who does not thereby lose her virginity. For just as He Himself became man without changing His nature or altering His power, so He makes her who bore Him a Mother while keeping her a Virgin. In this way He reveals one miracle through another miracle, at the same time concealing the one with the other. This is because in Himself, according to His essence. God always remains a mystery. He expresses His natural hiddenness in such a way that He makes it the more hidden through the revelation. Similarly, in the case of the Virgin who bore Him, He made her a Mother in such a way that by conceiving Him the bonds of her virginity became even more indissoluble.</p>
      <p> moved towards what is unstable and subject to movement, in order to stop it from being swept away; not only does human nature produce without seed, in a way that is supranatural, the flesh which is brought to perfection by the Logos, in order to prevent it too from being swept away; but a star from the east shone in the day and guided the Magi (cf. Matt. 2:2-10) to the place where the Logos became incarnate, in order to show in a mystical way that the inner teaching of the Law and the prophets is superior to the senses and guides the Gentiles towards the supreme light of spiritual knowledge. For</p>
      <p> [V2] 167</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> clearly the inner teaching of the Law and the prophets, when contemplated devoutly like a star, leads to knowledge of the incarnate Logos those who freely respond to the call of grace.</p>
      <p> 11.  As man I deliberately transgressed the divine commandment, when the devil, enticing me with the hope of divinity (cf Gen. 3:5), dragged me down from my natural stability into the realm of sensual pleasure; and he was proud to have thus brought death mto existence, for he delights in the corruption of human nature. Because of this, God became perfect man, taking on everything that belongs to human nature except sin (cf. Heb. 4:15); and indeed sin is not part of human nature. In this way, by enticmg the insatiable serpent with the bait of the flesh. He provoked him to open his mouth and swallow it. This flesh proved poison to him, destroying him utterly by the power of the Divinity within it; but to human nature it proved a remedy restoring it to its original grace by that same power of the Divinity within it. For just as the devil poured out his venom of sin on the tree of knowledge and corrupted human nature once it had tasted it, so when he wished to devour the flesh of the Master he was himself destroyed by the power of the Divinity within it.</p>
      <p> 12.  The great mystery of the incarnation remains a mystery eternally. Not only is what is not yet seen of it greater than what has been revealed - for it is revealed merely to the extent that those saved by it can grasp it - but also even what is revealed still remains entirely hidden and is by no means known as it really is. What I have said should not appear paradoxical. For God is beyond being and transcends all beyond-beingness; and so, when He wished to come down to the level of being. He became being in a manner which transcends bemg. Thus, too, although transcending man, yet out of love for man He truly became man by taking on the substance of men; .but the manner in which He became man always remains un-revealed, for He was made man in a way which transcends man.</p>
      <p> 13. Let us contemplate with faith the mystery of the divine incarnation and in all simplicity let us simply praise Him who in His great generosity became man for us. For who, relying on the power of rational demonstration, can explain how the conception of the divine Logos took place? How was flesh generated without seed? How was there an engendering without loss of maidenhood? How did a mother after giving birth remain a virgin? How did He who</p>
      <p> [V2] 168</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> was supremely perfect develop as He grew up (cf. Luke 2:52)? How was He who was pure baptized? How did He who was hungry give sustenance (cf Matt. 4: 2; 14:14-21)? How did He who was weary impart strength (cf. John 4:6)? How did He who suffered dispense healing? How did He who was dying bestow life? And, to put the most important last, how did God become man? And - what is even more mysterious - how did the Logos, while subsisting wholly, essentially and hypostatically in the Father, also exist essentially and hypostatically in the flesh? How did He who is wholly God by nature become wholly man by nature, not renouncing either nature in any way at all, neither the divine, through which He is God, nor ours, through which He became man? Faith alone can embrace these mysteries, for it is faith that makes real for us things beyond intellect and reason (cf. Heb. 11:1).</p>
      <p> 14.  Because Adam disobeyed, human nature has come to be generated through sensual pleasure; banishing such pleasure from human nature, the Lord had nothing to do with engendering by means of seed. Because the woman transgressed the commandment, the generation of human nature begins in pain (cf. Gen. 3:16); expelling this from human nature through His birth, the Lord did not allow her who bore Him to lose her virginity. He did this in order to expel from human nature both pleasure deliberately sought and the resulting unsought pain, becoming the destroyer of those things which He did not create. Through this He also mystically taught us to embark of our own accord on another way of life, one perhaps begun in pain and labor but nevertheless ending in divine pleasure and everlasting gladness. That is why He who made man became a man and was bom as a man, so that He might save man and, by healing our passions through His passion, might Himself supra-naturally destroy the passions that were destroying us, in His compassion renewing us in the spirit through His privations in the flesh.</p>
      <p> 15.  He who longing for the divine has overcome the soul's predilection for the body is free from physical limitations even though he is in a body. For God, who attracts the desire of the person who longs for Him, is incomparably higher than all things, and does not allow anyone who longs for Him to direct his desire towards anything sequent to Him. Let us therefore long for God with all the strength of our nature and let us keep our resolution unfettered by any bodily needs. Let us rise above all sensible and intelligible</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> realities, and let us not allow any physical limitation to compromise our resolve to be with God, who is by nature beyond all limitation.</p>
      <p> 16.   The suffering of the saints lies in the struggle between malice and virtue, the former fighting to win control, the latter enduring all things to avoid defeat. The first struggles to nurture sin by chastising the righteous; the second to hold good men firm although they experience more than their share of misfortunes.</p>
      <p> 17.  The task of virtue is to contend against hardship and suffering. The prize for victory, given to those who stand their ground, is the soul's dispassion. In this state the soul is united with God through love, and in inward resolution it is separated from the body and the world. Those who stand their ground find that the soul's strength lies in the body's affliction.</p>
      <p> 18.  Beguiled from our original state by the deceitfulness of sensual pleasure, we chose death rather than true life. Let us then gladly endure the bodily hardship which puts such pleasure to death. In this way the death of pleasure will destroy the death which came about through pleasure, and we shall receive back, purchased with but slight bodily hardship, the life which we sold for the sake of sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> 19.  If when the flesh has an easy life the force of sin tends to grow stronger. It is clear that when the flesh suffers affliction the force of virtue will also increase. So let us bravely endure the affliction of the flesh, which cleanses the soul's stains and brings us future glory. For 'the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us' (Rom. 8:18).</p>
      <p> 20.  When physicians are treating the body they do not administer the same remedy in all cases. Neither does God, when treating the illnesses of the soul, regard a single kind of therapy as suitable for all conditions but He allots to each soul what is suitable for it and effects its cure. So let us give thanks while we are being created, however great our suffering, for the result is blessed.</p>
      <p> 21.  Nothing disciplines the disposition of the soul so well as the protests of the afflicted flesh. If the soul gives way to them, it will be evident that it loves the flesh more than God. But if it remains unshaken by these</p>
      <p> disturbances, it will be shown to honor virtue more than the flesh. Through virtue God will come to dwell in it ■ God who for the soul's sake patiently bears our human suffering -</p>
      <p> [V2] 170</p>

      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> and will say to it as He once did to the disciples, 'Have courage, for I have overcome the world' (John 16 : 33).</p>
      <p> 22.  If all the saints had their share of discipline, we too should thank God that we are disciplined with them, so that we may be found worthy to partake of their glory, 'for whom the Lord loves He disciplines; He chastens every son He accepts' (Prov. 3:12. LXX).</p>
      <p> 23.  When Adam accepted the sensual pleasure offered to him by Eve, who had come from his side, he expelled humanity from paradise (cf Gen. 3:24). But when the Lord in His agony was pierced in his side by the lance. He brought the robber into paradise (cf. Luke 23:43). Let us. then, love the suffering of the flesh and hate its pleasure; for the first brings us in and restores God's blessings to us, while the second drives us out and separates us from those blessings.</p>
      <p> 24.  If God suffers in the flesh when He is made man, should we not rejoice when we suffer, for we have God to share our sufferings? This shared suffering confers the kingdom on us. For he spoke truly who said, "If we suffer with Him, then we shall also be glorified with Him' (Rom. 8:17).</p>
      <p> 25.   If we have to suffer because our ancestor involved our nature with sensual pleasure, let us endure our temporary sufferings bravely; for they blunt the sharp point of such pleasure for us, and free us from the eternal torment which it brings upon us.</p>
      <p> 26.  Love is the consummation of all blessings, since all who walk in it love leads and guides towards God, the supreme blessing and cause of every blessing, and unites them with Him; for love is faithful and never fails (cf. 1 Cor. 13:8). Faith is the foundation of what comes after it, namely hope and love, since it provides a firm basis for truth. Hope is the strength of the two pre-eminent gifts of love and faith, since hope gives us glimpses both of that in which we believe and of that for which we long, and teaches us to make our way towards our goal. Love is the completion of the other two, embracing entirely the entire desire of all desires, and satisfying the</p>
      <p> yearning of our faith and hope for it: for that which we beheve to be and which we hope will come to pass, love enables us to enjoy as a present reality.</p>
      <p> 27.  The most perfect work of love, and the fulfillment of its activity, is to effect an exchange between those it joins together, which in some measure unites their distinctive characteristics and</p>
      <p> [V2] 171</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> adapts their respective conditions to each other. Love makes man god, and reveals and manifests God as man, through the single and identical purpose and activity of the will of both.</p>
      <p> 28.   If we are made, as we are, in the image of God (cf Gen. 1:27), let us become the image both of ourselves and of God; or rather let us all become the image of the one whole God, bearing nothing earthly in ourselves, so that we may consort with God and become gods, receiving from God our existence as gods. For in this way the divine gifts and the presence of divine peace are honored.</p>
      <p> 29.  Love is a great blessing and of all blessings the first and supreme, since it joins God and men together around him who has love, and it makes the Creator of men manifest Himself as man through the exact likeness of the deified man to God, in so far as this is possible for man. This is what I take to be the actualization of the commandment, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might, and your neighbor as yourself (cf. Lev. 19:18; Deut. 6:5; Matt. 22:37-39).</p>
      <p> 30.   The devil has deceived us by guile in a malicious and cunning way, provoking us through self-love to sensual pleasure (cf. Gen. 3:1-5). He has separated us in our wills from God and from each other; he has perverted straightforward truth and in this manner has divided humanity, cutting it up into many opinions and fantasies.</p>
      <p> 31.   The greatest authors and instigators of evil are ignorance, self-love and tyranny. Each depends on the other two and is supported by them: from ignorance of God comes self-love, and from self-love comes tyranny over one's own kind. The devil establishes these in us when we misuse our own powers, namely our intelligence, our desire and our incensive power.</p>
      <p> of spiritual knowledge: through desire - through a passion of self-love which has been purified - we should be drawn in longing to the one God: and with an incensive power divorced from all tyrannical propensity we should struggle to attain God alone. From these three powers of the soul we should actualize that divine and blessed love on account of which they exist, that love which joins the devout man to God and reveals him to be a god.</p>
      <p> [V2] 172</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> 33.  Since self-love is, as I have said, the origin and mother of evil, when this is eradicated all the things which derive from it are eradicated as well. For when self-love is absent, not the slightest trace or form of evil can exist in any way at all.</p>
      <p> 34.  We should care for ourselves and each other in the way that Christ Himself, who patiently suffered for us, has already shown us in His own person.</p>
      <p> 35.  For the sake of love all the saints resisted sin, not showing any regard for this present life. And they endured many forms of death, in order to be separated from the world and united with themselves and with God, joining together in themselves the broken fragments of human nature. For this is the true and undefiled theosophy of the faithful. Its consummation is goodness and trath - if indeed goodness as compassion and truth as devotion to God in faith are the marks of love. It unites men to God and to one another, and on this account contains the unchanging permanence of all blessings.</p>
      <p> 36.   The actualization and proof of perfect love for God is a genuine and -willing attitude of goodwill towards one's neighbor. 'For he who does not love his brother whom he has seen', says St John, 'cannot love God whom he has not seen" (1 John 4:20).</p>
      <p> 37.  The way of truth is love. The Logos of God called Himself the way (cf. John 14:6, 1 John 4:8): and those who travel on this way He presents, purified from every stain, to God the Father.</p>
      <p> 38.  This is the door through which a man enters into the Holy of Holies and is brought to the vision of the unapproachable beauty of the Holy and Royal Trinity.</p>
      <p> 39.   It is a fearful and heinous thing for us, because of our love for things corruptible, deliberately to kill the life that was given to us by God as the gift of the Holy Spirit. Those who have trained themselves to prefer truth to self-love will certainly know this fear.</p>
      <p> 40.  Let us use peace in the right way: repudiating our evil alliance with the world and its ruler, let us at last break off the war which we wage against God through the passions. Concluding an unbreakable covenant of peace with Him by destroying the body of sin within us (cf. Rom. 6:6), let us put an end to our hostility towards Him.</p>
      <p> 41.  Rebelling as we do against God through the passions and agreeing to pay tribute in the form of evil to that cunning tyrant</p>
      <p> [V2] 173</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> and murderer of souls, the devil, we cannot be reconciled with God until we have first begun to fight against the devil with all our strength. For even though we assume the name of faithful Christians, until we have made ourselves the devil's enemies and fight against him, we continue by deliberate choice to serve the shameful passions. And nothing of profit will come to us from our peace in the world, for our soul is in an evil state, rebelling against its own Maker and unwilling to be subject to His kingdom. It is still sold into bondage to hordes of savage masters, who urge it towards evil and treacherously contrive to make it choose the way which leads to destruction instead of that which brings salvation.</p>
      <p> 42.  God made us so that we might become 'partakers of the divine nature' (2 Pet. 1:4) and sharers in His eternity, and so that we might come to be like Him (cf 1 John 3:2) through deification by grace. It is through deification that all things are reconstituted and achieve their permanence; and it is for its sake that what is not is brought into being and given existence.</p>
      <p> 43.   If we desire to belong to God in both name and reality, let us struggle not to betray the Logos to the passions, as Judas did (cf Matt. 26:14-16), or to deny Him as Peter did (cf Matt. 26:69-75). To deny the Logos is to fail through fear to do what is good: to betray Him is deliberately to choose and commit sin.</p>
      <p> 44.   The outcome of every affliction endured for the sake of virtue is joy, of every labor rest, and of every shameful treatment glory; in short, the outcome of all sufferings for the sake of virtue is to be with God, to remain with Him for ever and to enjoy eternal rest.</p>
      <p> 45.  Because He wishes to unite us in nature and will with one another, and in His goodness urges all humanity towards this goal, God in His love entrusted His saving commandments to us, ordaining simply that we should show mercy and receive mercy (cf. Matt. 5:7).</p>
      <p> 46.  The self-love and cleverness of men, alienating them from each other and perverting the law, have cut our single human nature into many fragments. They have so extended the insensibility which they introduced into our nature and which now dominates it, that our nature, divided in will and purpose, fights against itself. Thus anyone who has succeeded by sound judgment and nobility of intelligence in resolving this anomalous state of our nature has shown</p>
      <p> [V2] 174</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> mercy to himself prior to showing it to others; for he has molded his will and purpose in conformity to nature, and through them he has advanced towards God by means of nature; he has revealed in himself what it means to be 'in the image' and shown how excellently in the beginning God created our nature in His likeness and as a pure copy of His own goodness, and how He made our nature one with itself in every way - peaceable, free from strife and faction, bound to God and to itself by love, making us cleave to God with desire and to each other with mutual affection.</p>
      <p> 47.  In His love for man God became man so that He might unite human nature to Himself and stop it from acting evilly towards itself, or rather from being at strife and divided against itself, and from having no rest because of the instability of its will and purpose.</p>
      <p> 48.  Nothing sequent to God is more precious for beings endowed with intellect, or rather is more dear to God, than perfect love; for love unites those who have been divided and is able to create a single identity of will and purpose, free from faction, among many or among all; for the property of love is to produce a single will and</p>
      <p> purpose in those who seek what pertains to it.</p>
      <p> 49.  If by nature the good unifies and holds together what has been separated, evil clearly divides and corrupts what has been unified. For evil is by nature dispersive, unstable, multiform and divisive.</p>
      <p> 50.  The true love of God, grounded in real knowledge, together with the total repudiation of the soul's affection for the body and this world, is the short road to salvation and brings deliverance from all sins. In this way, casting off desire for pleasure and fear of pain, we are freed from evil self-love and are raised to a spiritual knowledge of the Creator. In the place of the evil self-love, we receive an uncorrupt and spiritual self-love, separated from affection for the body: and we do not cease to worship God through this uncorrupt self-love, always seeking from Him sustenance for our souls. For true worship, genuinely pleasing to God, is the strict cultivation of the soul through the virtues.</p>
      <p> 51.  If you do not long for bodily pleasure and have not the slightest fear of pain, you have attained dispassion. For by overcoming such longing and fear, together with the self-love which has engendered them, you have killed at a single blow all the passions which have come into being through them and from them, as well as the principal source of all evil, ignorance. You have become full of</p>

      <p> that goodness which Is stable and permanent and always remains the same by nature; and in that goodness you stand absolutely immovable, "with unveiled face reflecting the glory of the Lord' (2 Cor. 3:18) and contemplating through the radiant brightness; within you the divine and unapproachable glory.</p>
      <p> 52.   Let us reject the pleasure and pain of this present life with what strength we have, and so free ourselves entirely from all thoughts of the passions and all machinations of the demons. For we love the passions because of pleasure and avoid virtue because of pain.</p>
      <p> by experience that every pleasure is inevitably succeeded by pain, and so directs his whole effort towards pleasure and does all he can to avoid pain. He struggles with all his might to attain pleasure and he fights against pain with immense zeal. By doing this he hopes to keep the two apart from each other - which is impossible - and to indulge his self-love in ways which bring only pleasure and are entirely free from pain. Dominated by the passion of self-love he is, it appears, ignorant that pleasure can never exist without pain. For pain is intertwined with pleasure, even though this seems to escape the notice of those who suffer it. It escapes their notice because desire for pleasure is the dominating force in self-love, and what dominates is naturally always more conspicuous and obscures one's sense of what is present with it. Thus because in our self-love we pursue pleasure, and because - also out of self-love - we try to escape pain, we generate untold corruptmg passions in ourselves.</p>
      <p> 54.  A man no longer experiences pleasure and pain when, freeing his intellect from its relationship with the body, he binds or rather unites it to God, tile real goal of love, longing and desire.</p>
      <p> 55.   Just as one cannot worship God in a pure way without utterly purifying the soul, so one cannot worship creation without pampering the body. By fulfilling, out of concern fop the body, that worship which causes corruption, and by thus acquiring self-love, man became subject to the unceasing action of pleasure and pain; eating always from the tree of disobedience - the tree of the knowledge of good and evil - in this way he acquired expenentially through sense-perception a knowledge in which good and evil were intermingled. And it would not be untrue to say that the tree of the knowledge of</p>

      <p> good and evil is the visible created world. For this world is by nature subject to that alternation which produces pleasure and pain.</p>
      <p> 56. Where intelligence does not rule, the senses naturally assume the dominant role. The power of sin is somehow mingled with the senses and induces the soul by means of sensual pleasure to have pity for the flesh, to which it is joined. When the soul pursues the impassioned and pleasurable cultivation of the flesh as its natural task, it is diverted from a life lived in accordance with nature and is impelled to become the author of evil, which has no</p>
      <p> substantial existence.</p>
      <p> 57.  Evil is the noetic soul's forgetfulness of what is good according to nature; and this forgetfulness results from an impassioned relationship with the flesh and the world. When the intelligence is in control it dispels this forgetfulness through spiritual knowledge, since intelligence, having investigated the nature of the world and the flesh, draws the soul to the realm of spiritual realities which is its true home. Into this realm the law of sin cannot penetrate: for the link between the soul and the senses has now been broken, and the senses, limited to the world of sensible objects, can no longer function as a bridge conveying the law of sin into the intellect. When the intellect transcends its relationship with sensible objects and the world to which they pertain, it becomes utterly free from the sway of the senses.</p>
      <p> 58.  When the intelligence dominates the passions it makes the senses instruments of virtue. Conversely, when the passions dominate the intelligence they conform the senses to sin. One must watchfully study and reflect how the soul can best reverse the situation and use those things through which it had formerly sinned to generate and sustain the virtues.</p>
      <p> 59.  The holy Gospel teaches men to reject life according to the flesh and to embrace life according to the Spirit. I am speaking of those who are always dying to what is human -1 mean human life in the flesh according to this present age - and living for God in the Spirit alone, after the example of St Paul and his followers. They do not in any way live then' own life but have Christ living in them in the soul alone (cf Gal. 2:20). Those, then, who in this age are truly dead to the flesh can be distinguished in this way: even though they suffer much affliction, torment, distress and persecution, and</p>
      <p> [V2] 177</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> experience innumerable forms of trial and temptation, nevertheless they bear everything with joy.</p>
      <p> 60. Every passion always consists of a combination of some perceived object, a sense faculty and a natural power -the mcensive power, desire or the intelligence, as the case may be - whose natural function has been distorted. Thus, if the intellect investigates the final result of these three inter-related factors - the sensible object, the</p>
      <p> sense faculty and the natural power involved with the sense faculty - it can distinguish each from the other two, and refer each back to its specific natural function. It can, that is to say, view the sensible object in itself, apart from its relationship to the sense faculty, and the sense faculty in itself, apart from its connection with the sensible object, and the natural power - desire, for example -apart from its impassioned alliance with the sense faculty and the sensible object. In this way, the intellect reduces to its constituent parts whatever passion it investigates, in much the same way as the golden calf of Israel in Old Testament days was ground into powder and mixed with water (cf. Exod. 32:20): it dissolves it with the water of spiritual knowledge, utterly destroying even the passion-free image of the passions, by restoring each of its elements to its natural state.</p>
      <p> 61.  A life stained with many faults arising from the passions of the flesh is a soiled garment. For from his mode of life, as if from some garment, each man declares himself to be either righteous or wicked. The righteous man has a holy life as a clean garment; the wicked man has a life soiled with evil actions. Thus a 'garment stained by the flesh' (Jude, verse 23) is the inner state and disposition of the soul when its conscience is deformed by the recollection of evil impulses and actions arising from the flesh. When this state or disposition constantly envelops the soul like a garment, it is filled with the stink of the passions. But when the virtues, through the power of the Spirit, are interwoven in accordance with the intelligence, they form a garment of incorruption for the soul: dressed in this the soul becomes beautiful and resplendent. Conversely, when the passions are interwoven under the influence of the flesh, they form a filthy, soiled garment, which reveals the character of the soul, imposing on it a form and image contrary to the divine.</p>
      <p> 62.  A sure warrant for looking forward with hope to the deification of human nature is provided by the incarnation of God, which</p>
      <p> [V2] 178</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> makes man god to the same degree as God Himself became man. For it is clear that He who became man without sin (cf. Heb. 4:15) will divinize human nature without changing it into the divine nature, and will raise it up for His own sake to  the same  degree as He lowered Himself for man's sake. This is what St Paul teaches mystically when he says, '. . . that in the ages to come He might display the overflowing richness of His grace' (Eph. 2:7).</p>
      <p> 63.   When the intelhgence is in control of the incensive power and desire, it produces the virtues. When the intellect devotes its attention to the inner essences of created things, it reaps genuine spiritual knowledge. Thus the intelligence, after rejecting everything alien, discovers what is desirable according to our true nature: and the intellect, after passing beyond the things that are known, apprehends the Cause of created things that transcends being and knowledge. Then the passion of deification is actualized by grace: the intelligence's power of natural discrimination is suspended, for there is no longer anything to discriminate about: the intellect's natural mtellection is brought to a halt, for there is no longer anything to be known: and the person found worthy to participate in the divine is made god and brought into a state of rest.</p>
      <p> 64.  Suffering cleanses the soul infected with the filth of sensual pleasure and detaches it completely from material things by showing it the penalty incurred as a result of its affection for them. This is why God in His justice allows the devil to afflict men with torments.</p>
      <p> 65. Pleasure and distress, desire and fear, and what follows from them, were not originally created as elements of human nature, for in that case they would form part of the definition of that nature. I follow in this matter St Gregory of Nyssa, who states that these things were introduced as a result of our fall from perfection, being infiltrated into that part of our nature least endowed with intelligence. Through them the blessed and divine image in man was at the time of our transgression immediately replaced by a clear and obvious likeness to animals. Once the true dignity of the intelligence had been obscured, it was inevitable and just that human nature should be chastised by those witless elements which it had introduced into itself. In this way God m His providence wisely made man conscious of the nobility of his intellect.</p>

      <p> 66. Even the passions become good if we wisely and diligently detach them from what is bodily and direct them towards the acquisition of what is heavenly. This happens, for example, when we turn desire into a noetic yearning for heavenly blessings: or when we turn pleasure into the gentle delight which the volitive energy of the intellect finds in divine gifts: or when we turn fear into protective concern to escape punishments threatening us because of our sins: or when we turn distress into corrective remorse for present sin. In short, the passions become good if - like wise physicians who use the body of the viper as a remedy against present or expected harm resulting from its bite - we use them to destroy present or expected evil, and in order to acquire</p>
      <p> and safeguard virtue and spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 67.   The law of the Old Testament through practical philosophy cleanses human nature of all defilement. The law of the New Testament, through initiation into the mysteries of contemplation, raises the intellect by means of spiritual knowledge from the sight of material things to the vision of spiritual realities.</p>
      <p> 68.   Those who are beginners and stand at the gate of the divine court of the virtues (cf. Exod. 27:9) are called 'Godfearing' by Scripture (cf. Acts 10:2; 13:16, 26). Those who with some measure of stability have acquired the principles and qualities of the virtues, it describes as 'advancing'. Those who in their pursuit of holiness have by means of spiritual knowledge already attained the summit of that truth which reveals the virtues, it entitles 'perfect". Thus he who has abandoned his former passion-dominated way of life, and out of fear has submitted his entire will to the divine commandments, will lack none of the blessings which are appropriate to beginners, even though he has not yet acquired stability in the practice of the virtues or come to share in the wisdom spoken among those who are perfect- (cf. 1 Cor. 2:6). And he who is advancing will not lack any of the blessings which belong to his degree, even though he has not yet acquired the transcendent knowledge of divine realities possessed by the perfect. For the perfect have already been initiated mystically into contemplative theology: having purified their intellects of every material fantasy and bearing always the stamp of the image of divine beauty in all its fullness, they manifest the divine love present in their hearts.</p>
      <p> 69.  Fear is twofold; one kind is pure, the other impure. That</p>
      <p> [V2] 180</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> which is pre-eminently fear of punishment on account of offences committed is impure, for it is sin which gives rise to it. It will not last for ever, for when the sin is obliterated through repentance it too will disappear. Pure fear, on the other hand, is always present even apart from remorse for offences committed. Such fear will never cease to exist, because it is somehow rooted essentially by God in creation and makes clear to everyone His awe-inspiring nature, which transcends all kingship and power.</p>
      <p> 70.  He who does not fear God as judge but holds Him in awe because of the surpassing excellence of His infinite</p>
      <p> power will not justly lack anything: for having reached perfection in love, he loves God with awe and fitting reverence. He has acquired the fear that endures for ever and he will lack for nothing (cf Ps. 19:9; 34:9-10).</p>
      <p> 71.  From created beings we come to know their Cause: from the differences between created beings we learn about the indwelling Wisdom of creation: and from the natural activity of created beings we discern the indwelling Life of creation, the power which gives created beings their life - the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> 72.   The Holy Spirit is not absent from any created being, especially not from one which in any way participates in intelligence. For being God and God's Spirit, He embraces in unity the spiritual knowledge of all created things, providentially permeating all things with His power, and vivifying their inner essences in accordance with their nature. In this way He makes men aware of things done sinfully against the law of nature, and renders them capable of choosing principles which are true and in conformity with nature. Thus we find many barbarians and nomadic peoples turning to a civilized way of life and setting aside the savage laws which they had kept among themselves from time immemorial.</p>
      <p> 73.  The Holy Spirit is present unconditionally in all things, in that He embraces all things, provides for all, and vivifies the natural seeds within them. He is present in a specific- way in all who are under the Law, in that He shows them where they have broken the commandments and enlightens them about the promise given concerning Christ. In all who are Christians He is present also in yet another way in that He makes them sons of God. But in none is He fully present as the author of wisdom except in those who have understanding, and who by their holy way of life have made them-</p>

      <p> selves fit to receive His indwelling and deifying presence. For everyone who does not carry out the divine will, even though he is a believer, has a heart which, being a workshop of evil thoughts, lacks understanding, and a body which, bemg always entangled in the defilements of the passions, is mortgaged to sin.</p>
      <p> 74.  God, who yearns for the salvation of all men and hungers after their deification, withers their self-conceit like the unfruitful fig tree (cf Matt. 21:19-21). He does this so that they may prefer to be righteous in reality rather</p>
      <p> than in appearance, discarding the cloak of hypocritical moral display and genuinely pursuing a virtuous life in the way that the divine Logos wishes them to. They will then live with reverence, revealing the state of their soul to God rather than displaying the external appearance of a moral life to their fellow-men.</p>
      <p> 75.  The principle of active accomplishment is one thing and that of passive suffering is another. The principle of active accomplishment signifies the natural capacity for actualizing the virtues. The principle of passive suffering signifies experiencing either the grace of what is beyond nature or the occurrence of what is contrary to nature. For just as we do not have a natural capacity for what is above being, so we do not by nature have a capacity for what lacks being. Thus we passively experience deification by grace as something which is above nature, but we do not actively accomplish it; for by nature we do not have the capacity to attain deification. Again, we suffer evil as something contrary to nature which occurs in the will; for we do not have a natural capacity for generating evil. Thus while we are in our present state we can actively accomplish the virtues by nature, since we have a natural capacity for accomplishing them. But, when raised to a higher level, we experience deification passively, receiving this experience as a free gift of grace.</p>
      <p> 76.  We accomplish things actively in so far as our intelligence, whose natural task is to accomplish the virtues, is active within us, and in so far as there is also active within us our intellect, which is capable of receiving unconditionally all spiritual knowledge, of transcending the entire nature of created beings and all that is known, and of leaving all ages behind it. We experience things passively when, having completely transcended the inner essences of created beings, we come in a manner which is beyond conception to</p>
      <p> [V2] 182</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> the Cause itself of created beings, aid there suspend the activity of our powers, together with all that is by nature finite. Then we become something that is in no sense an achievement of our natural capacities, since nature does not possess the power to grasp what transcends nature. For created things are not by nature able to accomplish deification since they cannot grasp God. To bestow a consonant measure of deification on created beings is within the power of divine grace alone. Grace irradiates nature with a supra-natural light and by the transcendence of its glory raises nature above its natural limits.</p>
      <p> 77.  We cease to accomplish the virtues after this present stage of hfe. But, on a higher level than that of the virtues, we never cease to experience deification by grace. For an experience, or passion, which transcends nature is limitless, and so is always active and effective; while an experience, or passion, which is contrary to nature is without real existence, and so is impotent.</p>
      <p> 78.   The qualities of the virtues and the inner principles of created beings are both images of divine blessings, and in them God continually becomes man. As His body He has the qualities of the virtues, and as His soul the inner principles of spiritual knowledge. In this way He deifies those found worthy, giving them the true stamp of virtue and bestowing on them the essence of infallible knowledge.</p>
      <p> 79.  An intellect faithful in the practice of the virtues is like St Peter when he was taken captive by Herod (cf Acts 12:3-18). The name 'Herod" means "made of skins or leather", and so Herod signifies the law of leather, that is, the will of the flesh. St Peter is guarded by two squads of soldiers and shut in by an iron gate. The two squads signify the attacks suffered by the intellect from the activity of the passions and from the mind's assent to the passions. When through the teaching of practical philosophy, as though with the help of an angel, the intellect has passed safely through these two squads or prisons, it comes to the iron gate which leads into the city. By this I mean the obdurate and stubborn attachment of the senses to sensible things. None the less, the gate is opened automatically through spiritual contemplation of the inner essences of created beings; and such contemplation then fearlessly impels the intellect, now liberated from Herod's madness, towards the spiritual realities where it truly belongs.</p>

      <p> 80. The devil is both God's enemy and His avenger (cf. Ps. 8:2). He is God's enemy when he seems in his hatred for God somehow to have acquired a destructive love form men, persuading us by means of sensual pleasure to assent to the passions within our control, and to value what is transitory more than what is eternal. In this way he seduces all our soul's desire, separatmg us utterly from divine love and making us willing enemies of Him who made us. He is God's avenger when - now that we have become subject to him through sin - he lays bare his hatred for us and demands our punishment. For nothing pleases the devil more than punishing us. When he has been given leave to carry this out, he contrives successive attacks of passions inflicted against our will, and like a tempest he pitilessly assails us over whom, by God's permission, he has acquired authority. He does this.</p>
      <p> not with the intention of fulfilhng God's command, but out of the desire to feed his own passion of hatred towards us, so that the soul, sinking down enervated by the weight of such painful calamities, may cut itself off from the power of divine hope, regarding the onslaught of these calamities not as a divine admonition but as a cause for disbelief in God.</p>
      <p> 8L When those who have acquired moral stability and contemplative knowledge employ these for the sake of human glory, merely conveying an outward impression of the virtues, and uttering words of wisdom and knowledge without performing the corresponding actions, and when in addition they display to others their vanity because of this supposed virtue and knowledge, then they are rightly handed over to commensurate hardships, in order to learn through suffering that humility which was unknown to them before because of their empty conceit.</p>
      <p> 82.   Each demon promotes the attack of this or that particular temptation according to his innate propensity. For one demon is productive of one kind of evil, while another is clearly more abominable than his fellow and has a greater propensity for some other form of evil.</p>
      <p> 83.  Without divine permission even the demons themselves cannot assist the devil in any way at all. For it is God Himself in His loving providence who allows the devil, in appropriate ways, to inflict various sufferings through his ministers. The book of Job shows this plainly, describing as it does how the devil was utterly unable to approach Job unless God willed it (cf. Job 1:11-12).</p>
      <p> [V2] 184</p>

      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> Real faith is faith which is manifest and active. Accordingly, to those engaged in the practice of the virtues the Logos of God is revealed embodied in the commandments, and as Logos He leads them by means of these commandments up to the Father, in whom He subsists by nature.</p>
      <p> 85. Reformation of life, angelic worship, the willing separation of the soul from the body, and the beginning of divine renewal in spirit - these are proclaimed in the veiled language of the New Testament. For instance, by the term "spiritual circumcision" Scripture denotes the excision of the soul's impassioned attachment to the body</p>
      <p> (cf Phil. 3:3; Col. 2:11).</p>
      <p> 86.   Since God is fall of goodness and wishes utterly to eradicate from us the seed of evil - that is to say, the sensual pleasure which draws our intellect away from divine love - He allows the devil to afflict us with suffering and chastisement. In this way He scrapes the poison of past pleasure from our souls: and He seeks to implant in us a hatred and complete revulsion for the things which belong to this world and pander to the senses alone, by making us realize that once we have acquired them we gain nothing from their use save chastisement. For He wishes to make the devil's power of chastisement and hatred of men the contingent cause of the return to virtue of those who have by their own free choice lapsed from it.</p>
      <p> 87.   It is entirely fitting and just that those who gladly accept the devil's cunning suggestions to commit sins through their own volition should also be chastised by him. For through the passions to which we willingly accede the devil is the begetter of pleasure, and through the experiences that we suffer against our will he is the inflictor of pain.</p>
      <p> 88.  The contemplative and gnostic intellect is often committed for punishment to the devil, deservedly suffering hardship and affliction at his hands. This is so that by suffering it may learn patiently to endure affliction rather than to trifle arrogantly to no purpose with things that do not exist.</p>
      <p> 89.  If he who suffers for having transgressed one of God's commandments recognizes the principle of divine providence which is healing him, he accepts the affliction with joy and gratitude, and corrects the fault for which he is being disciplined. But if he is insensitive to this treatment, he is justly deprived of the grace that was once given him and is handed over to the turbulence of the</p>
      <p> [V2] 185</p>

      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> passions; he is abandoned so that he may acquire by ascetic labor those things for which he inwardly longs.</p>
      <p> 90.  A person who, knowing what faults he has committed, wilhngly and with due thankfulness endures the trials painfully inflicted on him as a consequence of these faults, is not exiled from grace or from his state of virtue; for he submits willingly to the yoke of the king of Babylon (cf Jer. 27:17) and pays off his debt by accepting the trials. In this way, while remainmg in a state of grace and virtue, he pays tribute to the king of Babylon not only with his enforced sufferings, which have arisen out of the impassioned side of his nature, but also with his mental assent to these sufferings, accepting them as his due on account of his former offences. Through true worship, by which I mean a humble disposition, he offers to God the correction of his offences.</p>
      <p> 91.  If you do not accept gratefully the trials which, by God's permission, are inflicted on you for your correction, and do not repent and rid yourself of your conceited opinion that you are righteous, you are given up to captivity, manacles, chains, hunger, death and the sword, and dwell a complete exile from your native land; for you resist the just penalties decreed by God and refuse to submit willingly to the yoke of the king of Babylon, as God has commanded. Banished in this way from your state of virtue and spiritual knowledge as if from your native land, you suffer all these things and more besides, because in your pride and vain conceit you refuse to make full satisfaction for your offences and to 'take delight in afflictions, calamities and hardships' (cf 2 Cor. 12:10), as St Paul did. For he knew that the humility produced by bodily sufferings safeguards the divine treasures of the soul; and for this reason he was content and endured patiently, both for his own sake and for the sake of those to whom he served as an example of virtue and faith, so that if they suffered when guilty, like the Corinthian who was censured (cf. 1 Cor. 5:1-5), they might have him who suffers innocently as an encouragement and as a model of patience.</p>
      <p> 92.   If, instead of stopping short at the outward appearance which visible things present to the senses, you seek with your intellect to contemplate their inner essences, seeing them as images of spiritual realities or as the inward principles of sensible objects, you will be taught that nothing belonging to the visible world is unclean. For by nature all things were created good (cf. Gen. 1:31; Acts 10:15).</p>
      <p> [V2] 186</p>

      <p> 93. He who is not affected by changes in sensible things practices the virtues in a manner that is truly pure. He who does not permit the outward appearances of sensible things to imprint themselves on his intellect has received the true doctrine of created beings. He whose mind has outstripped the very being of created things has come, as</p>
      <p> a true theologian, close to the One through unknowing.</p>
      <p> 94.  Every contemplative intellect that has 'the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God' (Eph. 6:17), and that has cut off in itself the activity of the visible world, has attained virtue. When it has excised from itself the image of sensible appearances it finds the truth existing in the inner essences of created beings, which is the foundation of natural contemplation. And when it has transcended the being of created things, it will receive the illumination of the divine and unonginate Unity who is the foundation of the mystery of true theology.</p>
      <p> 95.  God reveals Himself to each person according to each person's mode of conceiving Him. To those whose aspiration transcends the complex structure of matter, and whose psychic powers are fully integrated in a single unceasing gyration around God, He reveals Himself as Unity and Trinity. In this way He both shows forth His own existence and mystically makes known the mode in which that existence subsists. To those whose aspiration is limited to the complex structure of matter, and whose psychic powers are not integrated. He reveals Himself not as He is but as they are, showing that they are completely caught in the material dualism whereby the physical world is conceived as composed of matter and form.</p>
      <p> 96.  St Paul refers to the different energies of the Holy Spirit as different gifts of grace, stating that they are all energized by one and the same Holy Spirit (cf 1 Cor. 12:11). The "manifestation of the Spirit' (1 Cor. 12:7) is given according to the measure of every man's faith through participation in a particular gift of grace. Thus every believer is receptive to the energy of the Spirit in a way that corresponds to his degree of faith and the state of his souk and this energy grants him the capacity needed to carry out a particular commandment.</p>
      <p> 97.  One person is given the quality of wisdom, another the quality of spiritual knowledge, another the quality of faith, and someone else one of the other gifts of the Spirit enumerated by St</p>
      <p> [V2] 187</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>

      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> Paul (cf. 1 Cor. 12:8-11). In the same way, one person receives through the Spirit according to the degree of his faith, the gift of that perfect and direct love for God which is free from all materiality; another through the same Spirit receives the gift of perfect love for his neighbor and another receives something else from the same Spirit. In</p>
      <p> each, as I have said, the gift that conforms with his state is energized. For every capacity for fulfilhng a commandment is called a gift of the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 98.  The baptism of the Lord (cf. Matt. 20:22) is the utter mortification of our propensity for the sensible world; and the cup is the disavowal of our present mode of life for the sake of truth.</p>
      <p> 99.  The baptism of the Lord typifies the sufferings we willingly embrace for the sake of virtue. Through these Sufferings we wash off the stains in our conscience and readily accept the death of our propensity for visible things. The cup typifies the involuntary trials which attack us in the form of adverse circumstances because of our pursuit of the truth. If throughout these trials we value our desire for God more than nature, we willingly submit to the death of nature forced on us by these circumstances.</p>
      <p> 100.The baptism and the cup differ in this way: baptism for the sake of virtue mortifies our propensity for the pleasures of this life: the cup makes the devout value truth above even nature itself.</p>

      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> 1.   Christ mentioned the cup before the baptism (cf Matt. 20:22) because virtue exists for the sake of truth but truth does not exist for the sake of virtue. Thus he who practices virtue for the sake of truth is not wounded by the arrows of self-esteem: but he who pursues truth for the sake of virtue does harbor the conceit which self-esteem generates.</p>
      <p> 2.  Trath is divine knowledge, and virtue the struggles for trath on the part of those who desire it. A man who endures the labors of virtue for the sake of such knowledge is not vainglorious, because he knows that truth cannot be grasped naturally through human effort. For it is not in the nature of things for what is primary to be circumscribed by what is secondary. But a man who expects to attain knowledge by means of the struggles he makes for the sake of virtue invariably suffers from self-esteem, because he imagines he has gained the victor's crown before he has sweated for it. He does not know that labors exist for the sake of crowns, but crowns do not exist for the sake of labors. For by nature every spiritual method ceases to be practiced once the purpose for which it was intended-has been achieved or is thought to have been achieved.</p>
      <p> 3.  He who seeks only the outward form of knowledge, that is, knowledge which is merely theoretical, and pursues the semblance of virtue that is, a merely theoretical morality, is puffed up, Judaic-wise, with the images of truth.</p>
      <p> 4. He who does not view the ritual of the Law with his senses alone, but noetically penetrates every visible symbol and thoroughly assimilates the divine principle which is hidden in each, finds God in the Law. For rightly he uses his intellect to grope among the material forms of the Law, as among litter, in the hope of finding</p>

      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> hidden somewhere m its body that pearl or principle which utterly escapes the senses (cf Matt. 13:45-46).</p>
      <p> 5.   Again, he who does not limit his perception of the nature of visible things to what his senses alone can observe, but wisely with his intellect searches after the essence which lies within every creature, also finds: God. for from the manifest magnificence of created beings he learns what is the Cause of their being.</p>
      <p> 6.  Discrimination is the distinctive characteristic of one who probes. He then who examines the symbols of the Law in a spiritual manner, and who contemplates the visible nature of created beings with intelligence, will discriminate m Scripture between letter and spirit, in creation between inner essence and outward appearance, and in himself between intellect and the senses; and in Scripture he will choose the spirit, in creation the inner essence or  logos,  and in himself the intellect. If he then unites these three mdissolubly to one another, he will have found God: he will have come to recognize, as he should and as is possible, the God who is Intellect, Logos and Spirit. In this way he will be delivered from all the things which deceive man and seduce him into innumerable errors - delivered, that is to say, from the letter, the outward appearance of things, and the senses, all of which possess quantitative distinctions and are the negation of unity. But if a man compounds the letter of the Law, the outward appearance of visible things, and his own senses with each other, he is 'so short-sighted as to be blind' (2 Pet. 1:9), sick through his ignorance of the Cause of created beings.</p>
      <p> 7.  The apostle gives us the following definition of faith: 'Faith makes real for us things hoped for, gives assurance of things not seen' (Heb. 11:1). One may also justly define it as an engrained blessing or as true knowledge disclosing unutterable blessings.</p>
      <p> 8.  Faith is a relational power or a relationship which brings about the immediate perfect and supranatural union of the believer with the God in whom he believes.</p>
      <p> 9. Since man is composed of body and soul, he is moved by two laws, that of the flesh and that of the spirit (cf. Rom. 7:23). The law of the flesh operates by virtue of the senses; the law of the Spirit operates by virtue of the intellect. The first law, operating by virtue of the senses automatically binds one closely to matter; the second law, operating by virtue of the intellect, brings about direct union with God. Suppose there is someone who does not doubt in</p>
      <p> [V2] 190</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> his heart (cf. Mark 11:23) - that is to say, who does not dispute in his intellect - and through such doubt sever that immediate union with God which has been brought about by faith, but who is dispassionate or, rather, has already become god through union with God by faith: then it is quite natural that if such a person says to a mountain, "Go to another place', it will go (cf. Matt. 17:20). The mountain here indicates the will and the law of the flesh, which is ponderous and hard to shift, and in fact, so far as our natural powers are concerned; is totally immovable and unshakeable.</p>
      <p> 10.  The capacity for unintelligence is rooted so deeply in human nature through the senses that the majority think that man is nothing more than flesh, which possesses sense faculties so that he can enjoy this present life.</p>
      <p> 11.  'All things are possible', says Scripture, 'for the person who believes' (Mark 9:23) and does not doubt - that is to say, for the person who is not dominated by his soul's attachment to the body through the senses, and so does not separate himself from the union with God which faith has brought about in him through the intellect. Whatever alienates the intellect from the world and the flesh brings it, perfected by its spiritual achievements, close to God. That is what should be understood as implied in the saying, "All things are possible for the person who believes.'</p>
      <p> 12.  Faith is knowledge that cannot be rationally demonstrated. If such knowledge cannot be rationally demonstrated, then faith is a supranatural relationship through which, in an unknowable and so undemonstrable manner, we are united with God in a union which is beyond intellection.</p>
      <p> apprehended is completely in abeyance. As soon as it activates this quality by apprehending something sequent to God, it experiences doubt and severs the union which is beyond intellection. So long as the intellect is joined to God in this union, and has passed beyond nature and become god by participation, it will have transposed the law of its nature as though shifting an immovable mountain.</p>
      <p> 14. He who has just begun to follow a holy way of life, and has received instruction about how to act righteously, devotes himself wholly to the practice of the virtues in all obedience and faith, nourishing himself, as if on meat, on their manifest aspects, that is</p>
      <p> [V2] 191</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> to say, on moral training. The inner principles of the commandments, which constitute the knowledge of the perfect, in his faith he leaves to God, for he cannot as yet embrace the full magnitude of faith.</p>
      <p> 15. The perfect man, who has passed beyond the category not only of beginners but also of those who are advancing, is not ignorant of the inner principles of the actions he performs in carrying out the commandments. On the contrary, he first spiritually imbibes those principles and then by means of his actions feeds upon the whole body of the virtues. In this way he transposes to the plane of spiritual knowledge actions which take place in the sensible realm.</p>
      <p> 16.  The Lord said, 'First seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness' (Matt. 6:33). That is, seek the knowledge of truth before all things, and therefore seek training in appropriate methods of attaining it. In saying this. He showed clearly that believers must seek only divine knowledge and the virtue which adorns it with corresponding actions.</p>
      <p> 17.  Many are the things of which the believer has need in order to attain knowledge of God and virtue: deliverance from passions, patient acceptance of trials, the inner principles of virtues, the practice of methods of spiritual warfare, the uprooting of the soul's predilection for the flesh, the breaking of the senses' attachment to sensible objects, the utter withdrawal of the intellect from all created things: and, in short, there are countless other things which help us to reject sin and ignorance and to attain knowledge and virtue. It was surely because of this</p>
      <p> that the Lord said, 'Whatever you ask for in prayer, beheving, you will receive' (Matt. 21:22), stating simply that the devout must seek and ask with understanding and faith for all those things, and for those alone, which lead to virtue and knowledge of God. For all these things are profitable, and unquestionably the Lord gives them to those who ask.</p>
      <p> 18.  Thus he who for the sake of faith alone - that is to say, for the sake of direct union with. God - seeks all the things that contribute towards this union will unquestionably receive them. He who seeks either the things which we have mentioned or other things without this motive will not receive them. For he has no faith, but like an unbeliever uses divine things to boost his own glory.</p>
      <p> 19.  He who purges his will from the corruption of sin destroys the corrupting activity of what causes corruption. For when one's</p>
      <p> [V2] 192</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> free will is itself free from corruption, it prevents nature from being corrupted by hostile forces and keeps it incorrupt through the providential grace of the Spirit within it.</p>
      <p> 20.   Since the principles of nature and of grace are not one and the same, we should not be surprised if certain of the saints sometimes resisted the passions and sometimes succumbed to them; for we know that the miracle of resistance is due to grace, while the passion belongs to nature.</p>
      <p> 21.  He who keeps in mind the way of the saints by imitating them not only shakes off the deadly paralysis of the passions but also takes up the life of the virtues.</p>
      <p> 22.  God, who before all ages set the bounds of each man's life, in the manner which He wills, leads every man, whether righteous or unrighteous, towards the final end he deserves.</p>
      <p> temptations. The island is the firm unshakeable state of divine hope. The fire is the state of spiritual knowledge. The sticks are the nature of visible things. Paul gathered these with his hand, which I take to mean with the exploratory capacity of the intellect during contemplation. He fed the state of spiritual knowledge with conceptual images derived from the nature of visible things, for the state of spiritual knowledge heals the mental dejection produced by the storm of trials and temptations. The viper is the cunning and destructive power hidden secretly in the nature of sensible thmgs. It bites the hand, that is, the exploratory noetic activity of contemplation, but without harming the visionary intellect; and this, with the light of spiritual knowledge, as if with fire at once destroys the destructive power that arises from the contemplation of sensible things and that attaches itself to the practical activity of the intellect.</p>
      <p> 24. St Paul was a 'scent of life, leading to life' (2 Cor. 2:16) because he inspired the faithful by his own example to experience the fragrance of the virtues by putting them into practice, or because like a preacher he led those who had been converted by the word of grace away from life in the senses to life in the spirit. 'The scent of death leading to death'  {ibid)  gives a taste of their future condemnation to those who go from the death of ignorance to the death of unbelief. Or, alternatively, the 'scent of life, leading to life" refers to those who have advanced from the life of ascetic prac-</p>

      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> tice to that of contemplation, and the 'scent of death, leading to death' refers to those who have passed from the mortification of whatever is earthly in their nature (ef Col. 3:5j to the blessed mortification of impassioned conceptual images and fantasies.</p>
      <p> 25. The soul has three powers: the intelligence, the mcensive power and desire. With our intelligence we direct our search; with our desire we long for that supernal goodness which is the object of our search; and with our incensive power we fight to attain our object. With these powers these who love God cleave to the divine principle of virtue and spiritual knowledge. Searching with the first power, desiring with the second, and fighting by means of the third, they receive incorruptible nourishment, enriching the intellect with the spiritual knowledge of created beings.</p>
      <p> 26.  When the Logos of God became man. He filled human nature once more with the spiritual knowledge that it had lost; and steeling it against changefulness. He deified it, not in its essential nature but in its quality. He stamped it completely with His own Spirit, as if adding wine to water so as to give the water the quality of wine. For He becomes truly man so that by grace He may make us gods.</p>
      <p> 27.  When God created human nature, at the same time as He gave it being and free will He joined to it the capacity for carrying out the duties laid upon it. By this capacity I mean the impulse implanted in human nature on the level of both being and free will: on the level of being, so that man has the power to achieve the virtues; on the level of free will, so that he may use this power in the right way.</p>
      <p> 28.   We have as a natural criterion the law of nature. This teaches us that, before we can acquire the wisdom that lies in all things, we must through mystical initiation seek their Maker. ,</p>
      <p> 29.  Jacob's well (cf John 4:5-15) is Scripture. The water is the spiritual knowledge found in Scripture. The depth of the well is the meaning, only to be attamed with great difficulty, of the obscure sayings in Scripture. The bucket is learning gained from the written text of the word of God, which the Lord did not possess because He is the Logos Himself; and so He does not give believers the knowledge that comes from leammg and study, but grants to those found worthy ever-flowing waters of wisdom that spill from the fountain of spiritual grace and never run dry. For the bucket - that is to</p>
      <p> [V2] 194</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> say, learning - can only grasp a very small amount of knowledge and leaves behind all that it cannot lay hold of, however it tries. But the knowledge which is received through grace, without study, contains all the wisdom that man can attain, springing forth in different ways according to his needs.</p>
      <p> 30. There is a great and unutterable difference between the tree of life and the one which is not the tree of life. This is clear simply from the fact that the one is called the tree of life while the other is merely called the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (cf Gen. 2:9). Unquestionably, the tree of life is productive of life; the tree that is not called the tree of life, and so is not productive of life, is obviously productive of death. For only death is the opposite of life.</p>
      <p> 31.  The tree of life, when understood as symbolizing wisdom, likewise differs greatly from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, in that the latter neither symbolizes wisdom nor is said to do so. Wisdom is characterized by intellect and intelligence, the state which is opposite to wisdom by lack of intelligence and by sensation.</p>
      <p> 32.  Since man came into being composed of noetic soul and sentient body, one interpretation could be that the tree of life is the soul's intellect, which is the seat of wisdom. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil would then be the body's power of sensation, which is clearly the seat of mindless impulses. Man received the divine commandment not to involve himself actively and experientially with these impulses: but he did not keep the commandment.</p>
      <p> 33.  Both trees in Scripture symbolize the intellect and the senses. Thus the intellect has the power to discriminate between the spiritual and the sensible, between the eternal and the transitory. Or rather, as the soul's discriminatory power, the intellect persuades the soul to cleave to the first and to transcend the second. The senses have the power to discriminate between pleasure and pain in the body. Or rather, as a power existing in a body endowed with soul and sense-perception, they persuade the body to embrace pleasure and reject pain.</p>
      <p> 34.  If a man exercises only sensory discrimination between pain and pleasure in the body, thus transgressing the divine commandment, he eats from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, that is to say, he succumbs; to the mindless impulses that pertain to the senses; for he possesses only the body's power of discrimination.</p>
      <p> [V2]195</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> which makes him embrace pleasure as something good and avoid pain as something evil. Bat if he exercises only that noetic discrimination which distinguishes between the eternal and the transitory, and so keeps the divine commandment, he eats from the tree of life, that is to say, from the wisdom that appertains to his intellect; for he exercises only the power of discrimination associated with the soul, which makes him cleave to the glory of what is eternal as something good, and avoid the corruption of what is transitory as something evil.</p>
      <p> 35. Goodness so far as the intellect is concerned is a dispassionate predilection for the spirit; evil is an impassioned attachment to the senses. Goodness so far as the senses are concerned is tile impassioned activity of the body under the stimulus of pleasure; evil is the state destitute of such activity.</p>
      <p> 36.  He who persuades his conscience to regard the evil he is doing as good by nature reaches out with his moral faculty as with a hand and grasps the tree of life in a reprehensible manner; for he thinks that what is thoroughly evil is by nature immortal. Therefore God, who has implanted in man's conscience a natural hatred of evil, cuts him off from life, for he has now become evil in his will and intention. God acts in this way so that when a man does wrong he cannot persuade his own conscience that what is thoroughly evil is good by nature.</p>
      <p> 37.  The vine produces wine, the wine drunkenness and dnmkenness an evil form of ecstasy. Similarly the intelligence - which is the vine - when well-nurtured and cultivated by the virtues, generates spiritual knowledge: and such knowledge produces a good form of ecstasy which enables the intellect to transcend its attachment to the senses.</p>
      <p> 38.  It is the devil's practice maliciously to confound the forms and shapes of sensible things with our conceptual images of them. Through these forms and shapes are generated passions for the outward aspects of visible things, and our intellectual energy, being halted at the level of what pertains to sense-perception, cannot raise itself to the realm of mtelligible realities. In this way the devil despoils the soul and drags it down into the turmoil of the passions.</p>
      <p> 39.  The Logos of God is at the same time both a lamp and a light (cf Ps. 119:105: Prov. 6:23). For he humiliates those thoughts of the faithful which are in accordance with nature, but bums those</p>
      <p> [V2] 196</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> which are contrary to nature; He dispels the darkness of sensory life for those who press forward by means of the commandments towards the life that they hope for, but punishes with the fire of judgment those who willfully cleave to the dark night of this present life because of their love for the flesh.</p>
      <p> 40. It is said that he who does not first reintegrate himself with his own being by rejecting those passions which are contrary to nature will not be reintegrated with the Cause of his being - that is, with God - by acquiring supranatural blessings through grace. For he who would truly unite himseh" with God must first separate himself mentally from created things.</p>
      <p> 41.  The function of the written Law is to deliver men from passions; that of the natural law is to grant equal rights to all men in accordance with natural justice. The fulfillment of the spiritual law is to attain similitude to God, in so far as this is possible for man.</p>
      <p> 42.   The intellect has by nature the capacity to receive a spiritual knowledge of corporeal and incorporeal things; but by grace alone does it receive revelations of tike Holy Trinity. While believing that the Trinity exists, the human intellect can never presume to grasp what the Trinity is in Its essence, in the way that this is known to the divine Intellect. The person without spiritual knowledge is completely ignorant of the way in which sin is purged by virtue.</p>
      <p> 43.  He who loves falsehood is handed over to be harrowed by it, so that by suffering he may come to know what it is he willingly pursued, and may learn by experience that he mistakenly embraced death instead of life.</p>
      <p> 44.  God has knowledge only of what is good, because He is in essence the nature and the knowledge of what is good. He is ignorant of evil because He has no capacity for evil. Only of those thmgs for which by nature He possesses the capacity does He also possess the essential knowledge.</p>
      <p> 45.  The breast mentioned in Leviticus (cf Lev. 7:30, 34) indicates the higher form of contemplation. The shoulder (cf. Lev. 7:32, 34) stands for the mental state and activity concordant with the life of ascetic practice. Thus the breast and the shoulder denote respectively ritual knowledge and virtue for spiritual knowledge leads the intellect directly to God Himself, while virtue in the life of ascetic practice separates it from all involvement in generation. In the text m question, breast and shoulder were set aside for the</p>
      <p> [V2] 197</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> priests, who alone possessed the Lord as their inheritance for ever and had no share at all in earthly things.</p>
      <p> 46.  These fully endowed by the Spirit with spiritual knowledge and virtue are able, through preaching and instruction, to make the hearts of others receptive of true devotion and faith, withdrawing their disposition and</p>
      <p> capacity from its preoccupation with corruptible nature and directing it towards the actuahzation of supra-natural and incorruptible blessings. It is therefore fitting that in this same text the breast of the victims offered in sacrifice to God - that is, the hearts of those who offer themselves to God - and the shoulder - that is, their life of ascetic practice - should be set aside for the priests.</p>
      <p> 47.  Compared with the righteousness of the age to be, all earthly righteousness fulfils the role of a mirror: it contains the image of archetypal realities, not the realities: themselves as they subsist in their true and universal nature. And compared with knowledge there, all spiritual knowledge in this world is an indistinct image - it contains a reflection of the truth but not the truth itself as it is destined to be revealed (cf. 1 Cor. 13:12).</p>
      <p> 48.  Since what is divine consists in virtue and spiritual knowledge, the mirror displays the archetypes of virtue and the indistinct image reveals the archetypes of spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 49.  He who has conformed his life to God's will through practice of the virtues transposes his intellect to the realm of intelligible realities by means of contemplation. By so doing he places himself utterly beyond the reach of everything that seeks to entrap him, and so is not attracted through some sensory image towards the death that lies in the passions.</p>
      <p> 50.   The person who with the clear eye of faith beholds the beauty of the blessings of the age to be readily obeys the command to leave his country and his kindred and his father's house (cf. Gen. 12:1), and he abandons the flesh, the senses and sensory things, together with passionate attachments and inclinations. In times of temptation and conflict he rises above nature because he has put the Cause of nature first, just as Abraham put God before Isaac (cf Gen. 22:1-14).</p>
      <p> 51.   So long as you do not pursue virtue or study Holy Scripture for the sake of glory, or as a cloak for greed (cf. 1 Thess. 2:5), or from love of flattery and popularity, or for self-display, but do and</p>
      <p> [V2] 198</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> say and think all things for the sake of God, then you are walking with spiritual knowledge in the way of truth. If, however, you have in some respects 'prepared the way for the Lord", yet have not "made His, paths straight'. He will not come to dwell within you (cf. Isa. 40:3. LXX: Mark 1:3).</p>
      <p> 52.  If you fast and avoid a mode of life which excites the passions, and in general do whatever contributes to your deliverance from evil, then you have "prepared the way for the Lord'. But if you do these things out of self-esteem, or greed, or love of flattery, or for some similar motive, and not with a desire to perform God's will, then you have not 'made His paths straight'. You have endured the labor of preparing the way but do not have God walking in your paths.</p>
      <p> 53.  "Every valley shall be filled' - yet not "every' without qualification, or 'everyone's valley', for the text does not refer to the valley of those who have not prepared the way of the Lord and made His paths straight. By a valley IS meant the flesh or soul of those who have prepared the way of the Lord and made His paths straight in the manner I have explained. When such a valley has been filled with spiritual knowledge and virtue by the divine Logos who, present in His commandments, walks in its paths, then all the spirits of false knowledge and evil are 'abased': for the Logos treads them down and brings them into subjection. He overthrows that cunning power which has raised itself up against human nature: He levels it as if it were high and massive mountains and hills which He uses to fill in the valleys. For the rejection of passions which are contrary to nature, and the reception of virtues which are in accordance with nature, fills up the valley-like soul and abases the exalted lordship of the evil spirits (Isa. 40:4. LXX).</p>
      <p> 54.   The "rough places' - that is to say, the attacks of trials and temptations suffered against our will - shall be made 'smooth', above all when the intellect, rejoicing and delighting in weakness, affliction and calamity, through its unsought sufferings deprives of all their lordship the passions in which we deliberately indulge. For by 'rough places' Scripture means those experiences of unsought trials and temptations which change to smooth ways when endured with patience and thankfulness (cf Isa. 40:4. LXX).</p>
      <p> 55.  He who longs for the true life knows that all suffering, whether sought or unsought, brings death to sensual pleasure, the</p>
      <p> [V2] 199</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> mother of death: and so he gladly accepts the harsh attacks of trials and temptations suffered against his will. By patiently enduring them he turns afflictions into smooth untroubled paths, unerringly leading whoever devoutly runs the divine race along them towards 'the prize of the high calling' (Phil. 3:14). For sensual pleasure is the mother of</p>
      <p> death and the death of such pleasure is suffering, whether freely chosen or not.</p>
      <p> 56.  Everyone, then, who through self-restraint does away with sensual pleasure, which is intricate, convoluted and intertwined in many ways with every sensible object, makes the crooked straight. And he who with patience withstands and defeats the harsh implacable bouts of suffering turns the rough places into smooth ways. Thus, when a person has well and truly struggled, has defeated sensual pleasure with desire for virtue, has overcome pain with love for spiritual knowledge, and through both virtue and knowledge has bravely persevered to the end of the divine contest, he will see, according to Scripture, 'the salvation of God': and this will be his reward for virtue and for the efforts he has made to attain it (Isa. 40:4-5. LXX).</p>
      <p> 57.   The lover of virtue willingly puts out the fire of sensual pleasure. And if a man has dedicated his intellect to the knowledge of truth, he will not allow unsought sufferings to thwart the ceaseless aspiration that leads him towards God.</p>
      <p> 58.  When through self-control you have straightened the crooked paths of the passions in which you deliberately indulged - that is to say, the impulses of sensual pleasure - and when, by enduring patiently the harsh and painful afflictions produced by trials and temptations suffered against your will, you have made the rough ways smooth and even, then you may expect to see God's salvation, for you will have become pure in heart. In this state of purity, through the virtues and through holy contemplation, you will at the end of your contest behold God, in accordance with Christ's words: "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God' (Matt. 5:8). And because of the sufferings you have endured for the sake of virtue you will receive the gift of dispassion. To those who possess this gift there is nothmg which reveals God more fully.</p>
      <p> 59.  In Scripture hearts capable of receiving the heavenly gifts of holy knowledge are called cisterns (cf. 2 Chr. 26:10). They have been hewn out by the firm principle of the commandments; they</p>

      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> have been cleared, as if of earth, of self-indulgence in the passions and of natural attachment to sensible thmgs: and they have been filled with that spiritual knowledge which purges the passions and gives life and sustenance to the</p>
      <p> virtues.</p>
      <p> 60.  The Lord hews out cisterns in the desert, that is to say, m the world and in human nature. He excavates the hearts of those who are worthy, clears them of their material sordidness and arrogance, said makes them deep and wide in order to receive-the divine rains of wisdom and knowledge. He does this so that they may water Christ's flocks, those who need moral Instruction because of die immaturity of their souls.</p>
      <p> 61.  Scripture refers to the higher form of the spiritual contemplation of nature as 'hill-country' (Deut. 11:11). Its cultivators are those who have rejected the images derived from sensible objects, and have advanced to a perception of the noetic essences of these objects through the acquisition of the virtues.</p>
      <p> 62.   So long as the intellect continuously remembers God, it seeks the Lord through contemplation, not superficially but in the fear of the Lord, that is, by practicing the commandments. For he who seeks Him through contemplation without practicing the commandments does not find Him: he has not sought Him in the fear of the Lord and so the Lord does not guide him to success. The Lord guides to success all who combine the practice of the virtues with spiritual knowledge: He teaches them the qualities of the commandments and reveals to them the true inner essences of created beings.</p>
      <p> 63.   Sublime knowledge about God stands in the soul like a tower, fortified with the practice of the commandments. That is the meaning of the text, 'Uzriah built towers in Jerusalem" (2 Chr. 26:9). A man builds towers in Jerusalem when he is blessed with success in his search for the Lord through contemplation accompanied by the requisite fear, that is, by observing the commandments; for he then establishes the principles of divine knowledge in the undivided and tranquil state of his soul.</p>
      <p> 64.   When the inner principles of particulars combine with those of universals, they brmg about the union of what is divided. This is because the more universal a principle is, the greater the degree to which it embraces and unifies the more particular principles. Particulars usually have a natural affinity with universals. But there is also a</p>
      <p> [V2]201</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> certain spiritual principle which relates the intellect to the senses, heaven to earth, sensibles to intelligibles, and</p>
      <p> nature to the principle of nature, uniting them one with another.</p>
      <p> 65.  If you have been able to free your senses from the passions and have separated your soul from its attachment to the senses, you will have succeeded in barring the devil from entering the intellect by means of the senses. It is to this end that you should build safe towers in the desert (cf 2 Chr. 26:10). By 'desert" is meant natural contemplation: by 'safe towers' a true understanding of the nature of created beings. If you take refuge in these towers, you will not fear the demons who raid this desert - that is, who insinuate themselves into the nature of visible thmgs, deceiving the intellect through the senses and dragging it off into the darkness of ignorance. If you acquire a true understanding of each thing, you will not be afraid of the demons who deceive men by means of the external appearance of sensible objects.</p>
      <p> 66.  Every intellect that has the power to contemplate is a trae cultivator: so long as it has the remembrance of God to sustain it, it keeps the seeds of divine goodness dear of tales through its own diligence and solicitude. For it is said, 'And with fear of the Lord he sought God in the days of Zechariah' (2 Chr. 26:5. LXX). 'Zechariah' means 'remembrance of God'. So let us always pray to God to keep this saving remembrance alive in us, lest what our intellect has achieved corrupts our soul, filling it with pride and encouraging it to aspire presumptuously, like Uzziah, to what is above nature (cf 2 Chr. 26:16).</p>
      <p> 67.  Only a soul which has been delivered from the passions can without error contemplate created beings. Because its virtue is perfect, and because its knowledge is spiritual and free from materiality, such a soul is called 'Jerusalem'. This state is attained through exclusion not only of the passions but also of sensible images.</p>
      <p> 68.  Without faith, hope and love (cf. 1 Cor. 13:13) nothing sinful is totally abolished, nor is anything good fully attained. Faith urges the beleaguered intellect to press on towards God and encourages it by equipping it with a full range of spiritual weapons. Hope is the intellect's surest pledge of divine help and promises the destruction of hostile powers. Love makes it difficult or, rather, makes it utterly impossible for the intellect to estrange itself from</p>
      <p> [V2] 202</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> the tender care of God; and when the intellect is under attack, love impels it to concentrate its whole natural power into longing for the divine.</p>
      <p> 69.   Faith encourages the beleaguered inteUect and strengthens it with the hope of assistance. Hope brings before its eyes this help promised by faith and drives off the enemy's attack. Love kills the enemy's provocations within the devout intellect, utterly obliterating them with deep longing for the divine.</p>
      <p> 70.  The first and unique effect of the divme gift of genuine spiritual knowledge is to produce within us by faith the resurrection of God. Faith needs to be accompanied, by the right ordering of our will and purpose - that is to say, by discrimination - which makes it possible for us bravely to withstand the spate of trials and temptations, sought or unsought. Thus faith, rightfully expressing itself through the fulfillment of the commandments, is the first resurrection withm us of the God whom we have slain through our ignorance.</p>
      <p> 71.   The return to God clearly implies the fullest affirmation of hope in Him, for without this nobody can accept God in any way at all. For it is characteristic of hope that it brings future things before us as if they were present, and so it assures those who are attacked by hostile powers that God, in whose name and for whose sake the saints go into battle, protects them and is in no way absent. For without some expectation, pleasant or unpleasant, no one can ever undertake a return to the divine.</p>
      <p> 72.   Nothing so much as love brings together those who have been sundered and produces in them an effective union of will and purpose. Love is distinguished by the beauty of recognizing the equal value of all men. Love is bom in a man when his soul's powers - that is, his intelligence, mcensive power and desire - are concentrated and unified around the divine. Those who by grace have come to recognize the equal value of all men in God's sight and who engrave His beauty on their memory, possess an ineradicable longing for divine love, for such love is always imprinting this beauty on their intellect.</p>
      <p> 73.   Every intellect girded with divine authority possesses three powers as its counselors and ministers. First, there is the intelligence. It is intelligence which gives birth to that faith, founded upon spiritual knowledge, whereby the intellect learns that God is always</p>
      <p> [V2] 203</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> present in an unutterable way, and through which it grasps, with the aid of hope, things of the future as though they were present. Second, there is desire. It is desire which generates that divine love through which the intellect, when of its own free will it aspires to pure divinity, is wedded in an indissoluble manner to this aspiration. Third, there is the incensive power. It is with this power that the intellect cleaves to divine peace and concentrates its desire on</p>
      <p> divine love. Every intellect possesses these three powers, and they cooperate with it in order to purge evil and to establish and sustain holiness.</p>
      <p> 74.  Without the power of intelligence there is no capacity for spiritual knowledge; and without spiritual knowledge we cannot have the faith from which springs that hope whereby we grasp things of the future as though they were present. Without the power of desire there is no longing, and so no love, which is the issue of longing; for the property of desire is to love something. And without the incensive power, intensifying the desire for union with what is loved, there can be no peace, for peace is truly the complete and undisturbed possession of what is desired.</p>
      <p> 75.  Until you have been completely purified from the passions you should not engage in natural contemplation through the images of sensible things; for until then such images are able to mould your intellect so that it conforms to passion. An intellect which, fed by the senses, dwells in imagination on the visible aspects of sensible things becomes the creator of impure passions, for it is not able to advance through contemplation to those intelligible realities cognate with it.</p>
      <p> 76.  When faced with the eruption of the passions, you should courageously close your senses and totally reject the images and memories of sensible things, and in every way restrict the intellect's natural tendency to investigate things in the external world. Then, with God's help, you will abase and overcome the cunning tyrannical power which rises up against you.</p>
      <p> 77.  When intelligence is stupefied, the incensive power precipitate and desire mindless, and when ignorance, a domineering spirit and licentiousness govern the soul, then sm becomes a habit, actively entangling one m the various pleasures of the senses.</p>
      <p> 78.  The mature intellect must with spiritual knowledge escape from invisible entanglements. While it is being provoked by evil</p>
      <p> [V2] 204</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> powers it must not engage in natural contemplation or do anything but pray, tame the body with hardship, diligently bring the earthly will into subjection, and guard the walls of the city, that is, the virtues which protect the soul or the</p>
      <p> qualities which guard the virtues, namely, self-control and patience. Otherwise he who proffers the soul a foul potion may deceive the intellect with what seems to be good and secretly turn its desire away from God, drawing its understanding, which seeks what is good, towards what is bad, because it has mistaken the bad for the good.</p>
      <p> 79.  The person who courageously closes his senses by means of the deliberate and all-embracing practice of self-control and patience, and prevents sensory forms from entering the intellect through the soul's faculties, easily frustrates the wicked schemes of the devil and turns him back, abased, along the way by which he came. The way by which the devil comes consists of material things which seem to be needed for sustaining the body.</p>
      <p> 80.  The intellect reaps true knowledge from natural contemplation when, in a way that conforms to nature, it unites the senses to itself by means of the intelligence.</p>
      <p> 81.  When Scripture speaks of the springs blocked up by Hezekiah outside the city (cf 2 Chr. 32:3-4. LXX), the city signifies the soul and the springs the totality of sensible things. The waters of these springs are conceptual images of sensible things. The river that flows through the middle of the city is knowledge gathered in natural contemplation from these conceptual images of sensible things. This knowledge passes through the middle of the soul because it links the intellect and the senses. For the knowledge of sensible things is not entirely unconnected with the noetic faculty, nor does it depend altogether on the activity of the senses. On the contrary, it is as it were the intermediary between the intellect and the senses and between the senses and the intellect, and itself brings about the union of the two with each other. So far as the senses are concerned, it impresses on them the forms of sensible things, each according to its own kind; so far as the intellect is concerned, it transmutes these impressions into the inner essences of the forms. It is therefore fitting that the knowledge of visible things should be described as a river flowing through the middle of the city, for it occupies the middle ground between the intellect and the senses.</p>
      <p> [V2] 205</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> 82. If during periods of temptation and trial you refrain from natural contemplation and hold fast to prayer, withdrawing your intellect from all things and focusing it on itself and on God, you will put to death the inward disposition which produces evil and you will send the devil packing with his tail between his legs. For it was the</p>
      <p> devil who insinuated this habit into you and, relying on it, he boastfully approached your soul, vilifying truth with proud thoughts. David who had vast experience in the front line of every kind of spiritual battle, was most likely not simply familiar with these tactics but actually put them into practice: for he says: 'While the wicked one stood before me I was dumb and humbled myself and refrained from uttering even good words' (Ps. 39:1-2. LXX). Jeremiah, in the same spirit, warned the people not to go out of the city because the sword of the enemy lay about it (cf. Jer. 6:25).</p>
      <p> 83.  We may apply this also to Cain and Abel (cf Gen. 4:8). Cain is the law of the flesh, and the field into which Cain and Abel went is the realm of natural contemplation. Had Abel kept guard over himself and had he not gone out with Cain into the field before attaining dispassion, then the law of the flesh would not have risen up and killed him, cleverly deceiving him when he was engaged in the contemplation of created beings before being fully prepared.</p>
      <p> 84.  Similarly, if Dinah the child of Jacob had not gone out to the daughters of the land - that is, into the world of sensible images - Shechem the son of Hamor would not have risen up and humiliated her (cf. Gen. 34:1 -2).</p>
      <p> 85.   We should abstain from natural contemplation until we are fully prepared, lest in trying to perceive the spiritual essences of visible creatures we reap passions by mistake. For the outward forms of visible things have greater power over the senses of those who are immature than the essences hidden in the forms of things have over their souls. Of course, those who confine their minds Judaic-wise to the letter alone expect the promises of divine blessings to be fulfilled m this present age, for they are ignorant of the qualities naturally inherent in the soul.</p>
      <p> 86.  He who 'wears the image of Him who is from heaven" (1 Cor. 15:49) tries to follow the spirit of Holy Scripture in all things, for it is the spirit which, by promoting virtue and spiritual knowledge, sustains the soul. He who 'wears the image of him who is from earth' pays heed only to the letter, for the cultivation of the body by</p>
      <p> [V2] 206</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> means of the senses is promoted by the letter. Such cultivation in its turn generates the passions.</p>
      <p> 87.  By the power of God is meant the virtue that destroys the passions and safeguards holy thoughts. Such virtue is generated by the practice of the commandments: in this way, with God's co-operation or, rather, by His strength alone, we destroy the forces of evil that are opposed to sanctity. By God's sublimity is meant the spiritual knowledge of the truth, realized through our efforts to attain the contemplation of created beings and the practice of the virtues. Through spiritual knowledge we utterly annihilate the truth-opposing power of falsehood, abasing and demolishing the vaunting self-assertion of the evil spirits that exalt themselves against the knowledge of God (cf 2 Cor. 10:5). For just as ascetic practice gives birth to virtue, so contemplation engenders spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 88.  Ineffaceable knowledge, whose spiritual gyration around God's infinitude is unconditioned and beyond intellection, images in its unconditionality the more than infinite glory of the truth. The voluntary imitation of divine wisdom and goodness brings as its reward the intellect's longing for and glorious attainment of likeness to God, in so far as this is possible for man.</p>
      <p> 89.  The tongue is a symbol of the soul's spiritual energy and the larynx a symbol of natural self-love for the body. Thus he who ignobly welds the one to the other cannot give his attention to the tranquil state of virtue and spiritual knowledge, for he sedulously indulges in the confusion of bodily passions.</p>
      <p> 90.   Appetites and pleasures which are in accordance with nature are not reprehensible, since they are a necessary consequence of natural appetency. For our ordinary food, whether we wish it or not, naturally produces pleasure, since it satisfies the hunger which precedes a meal. Drink: also produces pleasure, since it relieves the discomfort of thirst; so does sleep, since it renews the strength expended in our waking hours, and so, too, do all our other natural functions necessary for maintaining life and conducive to the acquisition of virtue. But every intellect that is trying to escape from the confusion of sin transcends such passions, lest through them it remains a slave to passions which are subject to our control, contrary to nature and reprehensible; for these have no ground in us other than the activity of the passions which are m accordance with nature.</p>
      <p> [V2] 207</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> although not on that account destined to accompany us into immortal and everlasting life.</p>
      <p> 9L If the words of God are uttered merely as verbal expressions, and their message is not rooted in the virtuous way of life of those who utter them, they will not be heard. But if they are uttered through the practice of the commandments, their sound has such power that they dissolve the demons and dispose men eagerly to build their hearts into temples of God through making progress in works of righteousness.</p>
      <p> 92.  Just as God in His essence cannot be the object of man's spiritual knowledge, so not even His teaching can be fully embraced by our understanding. For though Holy Scripture, being restricted chronologically to the times of the events which it records, is limited where the letter is concerned, yet in spirit it always remains unlimited as regards the contemplation of intelligible realities.</p>
      <p> 93.  If you want to absorb the precise spintual sense of Holy Scripture in a way that accords with Christ's wishes, you must train yourself diligently in the interpretation of names, for in this way you can elucidate the meaning of alt that is written. But you must not Judaic-wise drag the sublimity of the Spirit down to the level of the body and the earth, and limit the divine inviolate promise of spiritual blessings to thmgs corrupt and transitory.</p>
      <p> 94.  Since a vow is a promise of some good thing offered by man to God, it may clearly be inferred that prayer is petition for the blessings bestowed by God on man with a view to his salvation and as a reward for the good inner state of those who make the prayer. Succor is the gift and growth, in the face of demonic attack, of virtuous qualities pursued through the practice of the ascetic life and of spiritual vision pursued through the life of contemplation. In the cry for such succor God naturally pays heed above all not to the loudness with which it is uttered but to the inner state of virtue and spiritual knowledge possessed by those who utter it.</p>
      <p> 95.   The evil and destructive kingdom of the devil - typified by kmgdom of the Assyrians (cf. 2 Kgs. 18:11) - has organized a war against virtue and spiritual knowledge, plotting to pervert the soul through the soul's innate powers. First it stimulates the soul's desire to develop an appetite for what is contrary to nature, and persuades it to prefer sensible to intelligible things. Then it rouses the soul's mcensive power to struggle with all its might in order to</p>
      <p> [V2] 208</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> attain the sensible object which it desires. Finally it teaches the soul's intelligence how to contrive opportunities for sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> 96.  In His supreme goodness God has not only made the divine and incorporeal essences of noetic realities images of His unutterable glory, each in its own way reflecting, in so far as this is granted, the supra-noetic splendor of His unapproachable beauty; He also permeates with echoes of His majesty things that are sensory and far inferior to noetic essences. These enable the human intellect, mounted upon them and carried above all visible things, to journey towards God and to attain the summit of blessedness.</p>
      <p> 97.  Every intellect crowned with virtue and spiritual knowledge is appointed like the great Hezekiah to rule over Jerusalem (cf. 2 Kgs. 18:1-2) - that is to say, over the state in which one beholds only peace and which is free from all passions. For Jerusalem means 'vision of peace'. Through the forms which fill creation, such an intellect has the whole of creation under its sovereignty. Through the intellect creation offers as gifts to God the spiritual principles of knowledge that lie within it; and as gifts to the intellect it presents the qualities conducive to virtue which exist within it in accordance with the law of nature. Both through the principles of spiritual knowledge and through the qualities of virtue creation honors the intellect so admirably fitted to make right use of both - the philosophic intellect perfected in both intelligence and action through contemplation and the practice of the ascetic life.</p>
      <p> 98.  He who has attained the summit of virtue and spiritual knowledge through the practice of the ascetic life and contemplation naturally transcends, every carnal and reprehensible passion; he also surmounts the condition of so-called natural bodies, that is, of beings subject to generation and corruption. In short, through contemplation he gains spiritual knowledge of the inner essences of all sensible forms and passes beyond them, raising his intellect to the divine realities that are akm to it.</p>
      <p> 99.  When, thanks to the hardships you have undergone in the practice of the virtues, you are appointed to dwell in the state of dispassion as though in Jerusalem and, freed from all the disturbance of sin, you practice, speak, hear and think nothing but peace; and when, after that, you have received through natural contemplation an understanding of the nature of visible things - a nature which</p>
      <p> [V2] 209</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> offers through you as gifts to the Lord the divine essences dwelhng within it, and presents to you, as if presenting gifts to a king, the laws that he within it - then you are "magnified in sight of all nations' (2 Chr. 32:23). For you are now above all things: through the practice of the virtues you have risen above natural bodies and the passions of the flesh, and through contemplation you have passed beyond the indwelling spiritual essences and qualities of alt sensible forms.</p>
      <p> 100.Practical philosophy sets above the passions the man who practices the virtues. Contemplation establishes above visible things the man who attains spiritual knowledge, raising his intellect to the noetic realities akin to it.</p>
      <p> [V2] 210</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> The person who combines spiritual knowledge with the practice of the virtues and practice of the virtues with spiritual knowledge is a throne and a footstool of God (cf Isa. 66:1) - a throne because of his spiritual knowledge and a footstool because of his ascetic practice. And. the human intellect, purified of all material images and occupied or, rather, adorned with the divine principles of the noetic world, is a heaven itself.</p>
      <p> When any philosopher - any devout philosopher - fortified with virtue and spiritual knowledge, or with ascetic practice and contemplation, sees the power of evil rising up against him through the passions, like the king of the Assyrians rising up against Hezekiah (cf. 2 Kgs. 18:13-16; Isa. 36:1-2), he is aware that Only with God's help can he escape. He invokes God's mercy by crying out silently and by striving to advance still further in virtue and knowledge; and he receives as an ally, or rather as his salvation, an angel, that is, one of the higher principles of wisdom and knowledge, who cuts off 'every mighty man, warrior, leader and commander in the camp' (2Chr.32:21).</p>
      <p> Every passion has its origin in the corresponding sensible object. For without some object to attract the powers of the soul through the medium of the senses, no passion would ever be generated. In other words, without a sensible object a passion does not come into being: without a woman there is no unchastity; without food there</p>
      <p> is no gluttony: without gold there is no love of money, and so on. Thus at the origin of every impassioned stimulation of our natural powers there is a sensible object or, in other terms, a demon inciting the soul to commit sin by means of the sensible object.</p>
      <p> 4.    Attrition suppresses the actualization of sin; obliteration destroys even the thought of it. For attrition prevents the realization</p>
      <p> [V2]211</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> of the impassioned act, while obliteration completely annihilates all demonic motivation in the mind itself.</p>
      <p> 5.  Sensible and noetic realities lie between God and man. When the human intellect moves towards God it transcends them, provided that it is not enslaved to sensible realities through outward activity and is not dominated in any way by the noetic realities it beholds during contemplation.</p>
      <p> 6.   Creation is the accuser of the ungodly. For through its inherent spiritual principles creation proclaims its Maker; and through the natural laws intrinsic to each individual species it instructs us in virtue. The spiritual principles may be recognized in the unremitting continuance of each individual species, the laws in the consistency of its natural activity. If we do not ponder on these things, we remain ignorant of the cause of created being and we cling to all the passions which are contrary to nature.</p>
      <p> 7.  Scripture exhorts us to offer gifts to God so that we may become conscious of His infinite goodness. For God receives our offerings as if they were entirely our own gifts and He had not already given us anything. In this way God's untold goodness towards us is fully evident, for when we offer Him things which in reality are His own He accepts them as if they were ours, and He makes Himself our debtor as though they were not already His.</p>
      <p> 8.  If we perceive the spiritual principles of visible things we learn that the world has a Maker. But we do not ask what is the nature of that Maker, because we recognize that this is beyond our scope. Visible creation clearly</p>
      <p> enables us to grasp that there is a Maker, but it does not enable us to grasp His nature.</p>
      <p> 9.  The wrath of God is the painful sensation we experience when we are being trained by Him. Through this painful experience of unsought sufferings God often abases and humbles an intellect conceited about its knowledge and virtue; for such sufferings make it conscious of itself and its own weakness. When the intellect perceives its own weakness it rejects the vain pretensions of the heart.</p>
      <p> 10.   The wrath of God is the suspension of gifts of grace - a most salutary experience for every self-inflated intellect that boasts of the blessings bestowed by God as if they were its own achievements.</p>
      <p> 11.  The intellect of every true philosopher and gnostic possesses both Judah and Jerusalem; Judah is practical philosophy and Jerusalem is contemplative intuition. Whenever by the grace of God</p>
      <p> [V2] 212</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> such an intellect repels the powers of evil with virtue and spiritual knowledge, and wins a complete victory over them, yet does not thank God, the true author of this victory, but boasts that the achievement is its own, it brings down the wrath of God's abandonment not only on itself but also on Judah and Jerusalem (cf. 2 Chr. 32:25), that is, on both its practice of the virtues and its contemplative life; it has failed to 'give thanks to God for the gifts that He has given"  (ibid.).  God at once permits shameful passions to vitiate its practice of the virtues and to sully its conscience, which until then was pure; He also permits false concepts to insinuate themselves into its contemplation of created beings and to pervert its spiritual knowledge, which until then had been sound. For ignoble passions immediately attack an intellect conceited about its virtue, just as an intellect over-elated because of its spiritual knowledge will be permitted by God's just judgment to lapse from true contemplation.</p>
      <p> 12. Providence has implanted a divine standard or law in created beings, and in accordance with this law when we are ungrateful for spiritual blessings we are schooled in gratitude by adversity, and brought to recognize through this experience that all such blessings are produced through the workings of divine power. This is to prevent us from becoming irrepressibly conceited, and from thinking m our arrogance that we possess virtue and spiritual knowledge by nature and not by grace. If we did this we would be using what is good to produce what is evil: the very things which should establish knowledge of God unshaken within us will instead be making us ignorant of Him.</p>
      <p> 13.  We know that the providence which sustains created beings exists in them as a divine rule and law. In accordance with God's justice, when those rich in blessings are ungrateful to Him who bestows them, they are schooled in gratitude by this richness being drastically curtailed; and through this adversity they are led to recognize the true source of the blessings they receive. For when conceit about one's virtue is left undisciplined it naturally generates arrogance, and this induces a sense of hostility to God.</p>
      <p> 14.  He who thinks that he has achieved perfection in virtue will never go on to seek the original source of blessing, for he has limited the scope of his aspiration to himself and so of his own accord has deprived himself of the condition of salvation, namely</p>

      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> God. The person aware of his natural poverty where goodness is concerned never relaxes his impetus towards Him who can fully supply what he lacks.</p>
      <p> 15.  He who has perceived how limitless virtue is never ceases from pursuing it, so as not to be deprived of the origin and consummation of virtue, namely God, by confining his aspiration to himself. For by wrongly supposing that he had achieved perfection he would forfeit true being, towards which every diligent person strives.</p>
      <p> 16.   The arrogant intellect is justly made the object of wrath, that is to say, it is abandoned by God, as 1 have already described, and the demons are permitted to plague it during contemplation. This happens so that it may become aware of its own natural weakness and recognize the grace and divine power which shields it and which accomplishes every blessing; and so that it may also learn humility, utterly discarding its alien and unnatural pride. If this indeed happens, then the other form of wrath - the withdrawal of graces previously given - will not visit it, because it has already been humbled and is now conscious of Him who provides all blessings.</p>
      <p> 17.   The person who has not been recalled to humility by the first form of wrath, namely abandonment, and does not through this humility learn true awareness, inevitably brings on himself the other form of wrath, which deprives him of the operation of the graces and leaves him destitute of the power that until then had protected him. For '1 will take away its protection", says God of an ungrateful Israel, 'and it will be plundered; 1 will break down its wall and it will be trampled under foot; 1 will destroy My vineyard, it will not be pruned or dug, and: briars will</p>
      <p> grow in it as in ground that is waste; and I will command the clouds not to rain on it' (Isa. 5:5-6. LXX).</p>
      <p> 18.  Complete unawareness of the loss of the virtues marks the downward path to godlessness. For the person who habitually disobeys God, through indulging in the pleasures of the flesh, will deny God Himself when the occasion arises. In preferring the life of the flesh to God, he places a higher value on sensual pleasures than on the divine will.</p>
      <p> 19.  When we think that our intellect has experienced something we must surely believe that its powers of ascetic practice and of contemplation have also shared m this experience in accordance</p>
      <p> [V2] 214</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> with their natural principles,/or a subject cannot experience something without the things within the subject also sharing in the experience. I call the intellect a subject because it is capable of receiving virtue and spiritual knowledge. By the phrase "within the subject' I refer to the life of ascetic practice and the contemplative life, which in relation to the intellect are accidents or attributes. Hence they share completely in the experience of the intellect, because it is the intellect's mobility that produces in them any modification which they undergo.</p>
      <p> 20.   Suppose the demons invisibly attack the intellect of a virtuous, God-loving man who, like Hezekiah, has girded himself spiritually with power against them, and who through prayer has received an angel sent to him from God (cf 2 Chr. 32:21), that is to say, has received one of the higher principles of wisdom, and so scatters and destroys the whole army of the devil; and suppose this man ascribes this victory and deliverance not to God but entirely to himself, then he has failed to 'give thanks to God for the gifts He has given' (2 Chr. 32:25). His gratitude does not match the greatness of his deliverance, nor does his inner attitude measure up to the bounty of his deliverer.</p>
      <p> 21.  Let us illumine our intellect with intellections of the divine world and make our body refulgent with the quality of the spiritual principles we have perceived, so that through the rejection of the passions it becomes a workshop of virtue, controlled by the intelligence. If the natural passions of the body are governed by the intelligence there is no reason to censure them. But when their activity is not controlled by the intelligence, they do</p>
      <p> deserve censure. This is why it is said that such passions must be rejected, for ahhough their activity is natural, they may often be used, when not governed by the inteUigence, in a way that is contrary to nature.</p>
      <p> 22. Anyone whose heart exuhs because of the divine gifts he has received, and who preens himself as though those gifts were his own and had not been received (cf. 1 Cor. 4:7), justly calls down wrath on himself. God permits the devil to entangle his intellect, to undermine the virtuous quality of his conduct, and to obscure the luminous principles of spiritual knowledge during his contemplation. This is to make him realize his own weakness and recognize the one power capable of defeating the passions in us. If this happens, he may repent and be brought to a state of humility, discarding his load of conceit</p>
      <p> [V2] 215</p>

      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> and being reconciled with God. Then he will avert the wrath that falls on those who do not repent, that takes away the grace which guards their souls, and leaves their ungrateful mmds destitute.</p>
      <p> 23.  When wrath takes the form of God allowing the demons to attack an arrogant intellect through the passions, it is a means of deliverance. For through suffering these shameful attacks the person that boasts of his virtues is enabled to learn who is the giver of these virtues. Otherwise he will be stripped of those things that are not in fact his, though he regarded them, as such, forgetting that he had received them as a gift.   :</p>
      <p> 24.   Truly blessed is the intellect that dies to all created beings:</p>
      <p> to sensible beings by quelling the activity of the senses, and to intelligible beings by ceasing from noetic activity. Through such a death of the intellect the will dies to all things. The intellect is then able to receive the life of divine grace and to apprehend, in a manner that transcends its noetic power, not simply created beings, but their Creator.</p>
      <p> 25. Blessed is he who has united his practice of the virtues to natural goodness and his contemplative life to natural truth. For all practice of the virtues is for the sake of goodness and all contemplation seeks spiritual knowledge</p>
      <p> solely for the sake of truth. When goodness and truth are attained, nothing can afflict the soul's capacity for practicing the virtues, or disturb its contemplative activity with outlandish speculations; for the soul will now transcend every created and intelligible reality, and will enter into God Himself, who alone is goodness and troth and who is beyond all being and all intellection.</p>
      <p> 26.  Goodness, which is the lull expression of divine activity within us, is said to be the consummation of practical virtue. The soul's intelligent power is drawn towards goodness when it uses its incensive and desiring aspects in accordance with nature. In goodness the beauty that is according to God's likeness is made manifest. The consummation of contemplative philosophy is said to be the truth. Truth is the simple, undivided knowledge of all the qualities that appertain to God. A pure intellect  is  draws towards this knowledge when it has nullified all judgment based on; the senses. Such knowledge makes manifest the dignity of the divine image in a wholly unsullied state.</p>
      <p> 27.  No one can truly bless God unless he has sanctified his body</p>
      <p> [V2] 216</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> with the virtues and made his soul luminous with spiritual knowledge. For a virtuous disposition constitutes the face of a contemplative intellect, its gaze turned heavenwards to the height of true knowledge.</p>
      <p> 28. Blessed is he who knows in truth that we are but tools in God's hands; that it is God who effects within us all ascetic practice and contemplation, virtue and spiritual knowledge, victory and wisdom, goodness and truth; and that to all this we contribute nothing at all except a disposition that desires what is good. Zerubbabel had this disposition when he said to God: "Blessed art Thou who hast given me, wisdom; I give thanks to Thee, 0 Lord of our fathers; from Thee comes victory and wisdom; and Thine is the glory and I am Thy servant' (1 Esd. 4:59-60). As a truly grateful servant he ascribed all things to God, who had given him everything. He possessed wisdom as a gift from God and attributed to Him as Lord of his fathers the efficacy of the blessings bestowed on him. These blessings are, as we have said, the union of victory and wisdom, virtue and spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> ascetic practice and contemplation, goodness and truth. For when these are united together they shine with a single divine glory and brightness.</p>
      <p> 29.  All the achievements of the saints were clearly gifts of grace from God. None of the saints had the least thing other than the goodness granted to him by the Lord God according to the measure of his gratitude and love. And what he acquired he acquired only in so far as he surrendered himself to the Lord who bestowed it,</p>
      <p> 30.  When a man's intellect is pre-eminent in virtue and spiritual knowledge, and he is determined to keep his soul free from evil slavery to the passions, he says, "Women are extremely strong but truth conquers all' (1 Esd. 3:12). By women he means the divinizing virtues which give rise to the love that unites men with God and with one another. This love wrests the soul away from all that is subject to generation and decay and from all intelligible beings that are beyond generation and decay, and - in so far as this can happen to human nature - it intermingles the soul with God Himself in a kind of erotic union, mystically establishing a single shared life, undefiled and divine. By truth he means the sole and unique cause, origin, kingdom, power and glory of created beings, from which and through which all things were made and are being made, by which and through which the being of all things is sustained.</p>
      <p> [V2] 217</p>

      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> and to which the lovers of God dedicate all their diligence and activity.</p>
      <p> 31. Women signit}' the supreme realization of the virtues, which is love. Love is the unfailing pleasure and indivisible union of those who participate through their longing in what is good by nature. Truth signifies the fulfillment of all spiritual knowledge and of all the things that can be known. For the natural activities of all created things are drawn by a certain universal intelligence to this truth as their origin and fulfillment. For the Origin and Cause of created beings has as truth conquered all things naturally, and has drawn their activity to Himself</p>
      <p> 32.  Because it transcends all things, truth admits of no plurality, and reveals itself as single and unique. It embraces the spiritual potentialities of all that is intellective and intelligible, since it transcends both intellective and intelligible beings; and by an infinite power it encompasses both the ultimate origin and the ultimate consummation of created beings-and draws the entire activity of each to itself. On some it bestows lucid spiritual knowledge of the grace they have lost, and to others it grants, through an indescribable mode of perception and by means of participation, clear understanding of the goodness for which they long.</p>
      <p> 33.   The intellect is the organ of wisdom, the intelligence that of spiritual knowledge. The natural sense of assurance common to both intellect and intelligence is the organ of the faith established in each of them, while natural compassion is the organ of the gift of healing. For, corresponding to every divine gift, there is in us an appropriate and natural organ capable of receiving it - a kind of capacity, or intrinsic state or disposition. Thus he who purges his intellect of all sensible images receives wisdom. He who makes his intelligence the master of his innate passions - that is to say, of his incensive and desiring powers - receives spiritual knowledge. He whose intellect and intelligence possess an unshakeable assurance concerning divine realities receives that faith with which all things are possible. He who has acquired natural compassion receives, after the utter annihilation of seh"-love, the gifts of healing.</p>
      <p> 34.  In each of us the energy of the spirit is made manifest according to the measure of his faith (cf. Rom. 12:6). Therefore each of us is the steward of his own grace and, if we think logically, we should never envy another person the enjoyment of his gifts, since</p>
      <p> [V2] 218</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> the disposition which makes us capable of receiving divine blessings depends on ourselves.</p>
      <p> 35. In other words, divine blessings are bestowed according to the measure of faith in each man. Similarly, the strength of our faith is revealed by the zeal with which we act. Thus our actions disclose the measure of our faith, and the strength of our faith determines the measure of grace that we receive. Conversely, the extent to</p>
      <p> which we fail to act reveals the measure of our lack of faith, and our lack of faith in turn determines the degree to which we are deprived of grace. Hence the person who out of jealousy envies those who practice the virtues is more than misguided, for the choice of believing and acting, and of receiving grace according to the measure of his faith, clearly depends on him and not on anybody else.</p>
      <p> 36.  He who aspires to divine realities willingly allows providence to lead him by principles of wisdom towards the grace of deification. He who does not so aspire is drawn, by the just judgment of God and against his will, away from evil by various forms of discipline. The first, as a lover of God, is deified by providence; the second, although a lover of matter, is held back from perdition by God's judgment. For since God is goodness itself. He heals those who desire it through the principles of wisdom, and through various forms of discipline cures those who are sluggish in virtue.</p>
      <p> 37.  Real faith is truth which is all-embracing, all-sustaining and free from all falsehood. A good conscience confers on us the power of love, since it is not guilty of any transgression of the commandments.</p>
      <p> 38.  Scripture says that seven spirits will rest upon the Lord: the spirit of wisdom, the spirit of understanding, the spirit of spiritual knowledge, the spirit of cognitive insight, the spirit of counsel, the spirit of strength, and the spirit of the fear of God (cf Isa. 11:2). The effects produced by these spiritual gifts are as follows: by fear, abstention from evil; by strength, the practice of goodness; by counsel, discrimination with respect to the demons; by cognitive insight, a clear perception of what one has to do; by spiritual knowledge, the active grasping of the divine principles inherent in the virtues; by understanding, the soul's total empathy with the things that it has come to know; and by wisdom, an indivisible union with God, whereby the saints attain the actual enjoyment of the things for which they long. He who shares in wisdom becomes god by partici-</p>

      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> pation and, immersed m the ever-flowing, secret outpouring of God's mysteries, he imparts to those who long for it a knowledge of divine blessedness.</p>
      <p> 39.  The spirit of the fear of God is abstention from evil deeds. The spirit of strength is an impulse and disposition prompt to fulfill the commandments. The spirit of counsel is the habit of discrimination according to which we fulfill the divine commandments intelligently and distinguish what is good from what is bad. The spirit of cognitive insight is an unerring perception of the ways in which virtue is to be practiced; if we act in accordance with this perception we will not deviate at all from the true judgment of our intelligence. The spirit of spiritual knowledge is a grasping of the commandments and the principles inherent in them, according to which the qualities of the virtues are constituted. The spirit of understanding is acceptance of the qualities and principles of the virtues or, to put it more aptly, it is a transmutation by which one's natural powers commingle with the qualities and principles of the commandments. The spirit of wisdom is ascension towards the Cause of the higher spiritual principles inherent in the commandments, and union with it. Through this ascension and union we are initiated, in so far as this is possible for human beings, simply and through unknowing into those inner divine principles of created beings, and in different ways we present to men, as if from a spring welling up in our heart, the truth which resides in all things.</p>
      <p> 40.   We ascend step by step from what is remotest from God, but near to us, to the primal realities which are furthest from us but near to God. For we begin by abstaining from evil because of fear, and from this we advance to the practice of virtue through strength; from the practice of virtue we advance to the. discrimination conferred by the spirit of counsel; from discrimination to a settled state of virtue, which is cognitive insight; from the settled state of virtue to the spiritual knowledge of the divine principles inherent in the virtues; from this knowledge to a state of understanding, that is, to the transmuted state in which we conform to the divine principles of virtue that we have come to know; and from this we advance to the simple and undistorted contemplation of the truth that is m all; things. From this point of vantage, as a. result of our wise contemplation of sensible and noetic beings, we will be enabled to speak about the trath as we should.</p>
      <p> [V2] 220</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> 41. The first good which actively affects us, namely fear, is reckoned by Scripture as the most remote from God, for it is called 'the beginning of wisdom' (Ps. 111:10; Prov. 1:7; 9:10). Setting out from this towards our ultimate goal, wisdom, we come to understanding, and this enables us to draw close to God Himself, for we have only</p>
      <p> wisdom lying between us and our union with Him. Yet it is impossible for a man to attain wisdom unless first, through fear and through the remaining intermediary gifts, he frees himself completely from the mist of ignorance and the dust of sin. That is why, in the order established by Scripture, wisdom is placed close to God and fear close to us. In this way we can learn the rule and law of good order.</p>
      <p> 42.  Ascending therefore with these eyes of faith, that is to say, with this enlightenment, we are drawn towards the divine unity of wisdom, which is divided into different gifts for our benefit; and by mounting from one virtue to another we unite with the source of those gifts. But with God's help we do not omit any of the stages we have already mentioned, lest by gradually growing neglectful we allow our faith to become blind and sightless because it is deprived of the enlightenment of the Spirit that comes through works. If this happened, we would be punished for endless ages because we have blinded m ourselves the divine eyes which had opened within us according to the measure of our faith.</p>
      <p> 43.   When by neglecting the commandments a person blinds the eyes of faith that are within him, then he is certainly doomed, for he no longer has God watching over him. For if Scripture calls the energies of the Spirit the 'eyes of the Lord' (Deut. 11:12), the person who does not open those eyes by fulfilling the commandments does not have God watching over him. God watches us only when through fulfilling the commandments we are illumined by the energies of the Spirit, for He has no other eyes by which He looks down on those who dwell on earth.</p>
      <p> 44.  Wisdom is a unity contemplated mdivisibly in the various virtues which arise from it; and it is perceived in a single form in the operations of the virtues. Again, it appears as a simple unity when the virtues which issued from it are reintegrated with it. This happens when we, for whose sake wisdom has produced from itself each individual virtue, are drawn upwards towards it by means of each virtue.</p>
      <p> [V2] 221</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> 45. When you fail to cany out the divine precepts of faith, your faith is blind. For if the precepts of God are light (cf. Isa. 26:9. LXX), it is clear that when you fail to put the divine precepts into practice you are without divine fight. You are God's servant merely in name, not in reality.</p>
      <p> 46. No one can plead the weakness of the flesh as an excuse when he sins; for the union of our humanity with the divine Logos through the incarnation, has renewed the whole of nature by lifting the curse, and so we have no excuse if our will remains attached to the passions. For the divinity of the Logos, which always dwells by grace in those who believe in Him, withers the rule of sin in the flesh.</p>
      <p> 47.  He who through faith in God and love for Him has conquered the witless desires or impulses of the passions which are contrary to nature, moves out of the sphere of natural law and enters wholly into the noetic realm. And, together with himself, he delivers from alien servitude his fellow-men and their concerns.</p>
      <p> 48.  Unless curbed by the fear of God that accompanies the practice of the virtues, spiritual knowledge leads to vanity; for it encourages the person puffed up by it to regard as his own what has merely been lent to him, and to use his borrowed intelligence to win praise for himself. But when his practice of the virtues increases concomitantly with his longing for God, and he does not arrogate to himself more spiritual knowledge than is needed for the task in hand, then he is made humble, reduced to himself by principles which are beyond his capacity.</p>
      <p> 49.  Man's heavenly abode is a dispassionate state of virtue, combined with a spiritual knowledge that has overcome all delusory notions.</p>
      <p> 50.  Plurality is the consummation of unity manifested, and unity is the origin of non-manifest pluralits'. For the origin of every consummation is clearly its non-manifest state, and the consummation of every origin is the full development of its potentiality for manifestation. Thus, since faith is the natural origin of the virtues, its consummation is the full development of the goodness realized through the virtues; and since natural goodness is the consummation of the virtues, its origin is faith. In this way there is an intrinsic reciprocity between faith and goodness: faith is implicit goodness and goodness is faith manifested. God is by nature both faithful and good (cf</p>
      <p> [V2] 222</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> Matt. 19:17); He is faithful as the primal good and good as the desire of all desires. These attributes are in every way</p>
      <p> identical with each other; and, except is our conception of them, they are not divided from each other in any way by any act of manifestation that takes its start from Him and ends in Him. Thus plurality, being the manifestation of God as the desire of all desires, brings to perfect fulfillment the longmg of all that aspires towards Him; while unity, being a symbol of God as the primal good, constitutes the perfect ground of all that is made manifest from Him.</p>
      <p> 51.  The first type of dispassion is complete abstention from the actual committing of sift, and it may be found in those beginning the spiritual way. The second is the complete rejection in the mind of all assent to evil thoughts; this is found in those who have achieved an intelligent participation in virtue. The third is the complete quiescence of passionate desire; this is found in those who contemplate noetically the inner essences of visible things through then outer forms. The fourth type of dispassion is the complete purging even of passion-free images; this is found in those who have made their intellect a pure, transparent mirror of God through spiritual knowledge and contemplation. If, then, you have cleansed yourself from the committing of acts prompted by the passions, have freed yourself from mental assent to them, have put a stop to the stimulation of passionate desire, and have purged your intellect of even the passion-free images of what were once objects of the passions, you have attained the four general types of dispassion. You have emerged from the realm of matter and material things, and have entered the sphere of intelligible realities, noetic, tranquil and divine.</p>
      <p> 52.  The first type of dispassion, in other words, is abstention from the body's impulsion towards the actual committing of sin. The second is the complete rejection of impassioned thoughts in the soul; through this rejection the impulsion of the passions mentioned in the first type of dispassion is quelled, since there are now no impassioned thoughts to incite it to action. The third is the complete quiescence of passionate desire, and through this the second type is generated, since it is brought into being by purity of thought. The fourth type of dispassion is the complete exclusion from the mind of all sensible images. This also produces the third type, since the mind no longer possesses those images of sensible things which produce imaginings of the passions in it.</p>

      <p> 53. Intelligence and reason are to be treated like the bondservants of Hebrew stock who are set free at the end of six years (cf Deut. 15:12). They labor like a servant and a handmaid for everyone who practices the virtues, since they conceive and realize the qualities of active virtue, and their whole strength is as it were drawn up against</p>
      <p> the demons that oppose the practice of the virtues. When they have completed the stage of practical philosophy - and this completion is represented by the sixth year, for the number six signifies practical philosophy -intelligence and reason are set free to devote themselves to spiritual contemplation, that is to say, they contemplate the inner essences of created beings.</p>
      <p> 54.  The mcensive power and desire, on the other hand, are to be treated like the servant and the handmaid of another tribe (cf. Lev. 25: 41-42). The contemplative; intellect, through fortitude and self-restraint, subjugates them for ever to the lordship of the intelligence, so that they serve the virtues. It does not give them their complete freedom until the law of nature is totally swallowed up by the law of the spirit, in the same way as the death of the unhappy flesh is swallowed up by infinite life (cf. 2 Cor. 5:4), and until the entire image of the unoriginate kingdom is clearly revealed, mnnetically manifesting in itself the entire form of the archetype. When the contemplative intellect enter this state it gives the incensive power and desire their freedom, transmuting desire into the unsullied pleasure and pure enravishment of an intense love for God and the incensive power into spiritual fervor, an ever-active fiery  elan,  a self-possessed frenzy.</p>
      <p> 55.  The intellect unwavering concentration on spiritual knowT-edge, and the incorruption of the senses when hallowed by virtue, constitute an image of the unoriginate kingdom. This occurs when soul and body, through the spiritual transmutation of the senses into the intellect, are united with each other solely by the divine law of the Spirit. In this state, the ever-active vital energy of the Logos always pervades them, and all unlikeness to the divine utterly vanishes.</p>
      <p> [V2] 224</p>

      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> 56. Pleasure has been defined as desire realized, since pleasure presupposes the actual presence of something regarded as good. Desire, on the other hand, is pleasure that is only potential, since desire seeks tike realization in the future of something regarded as good. Incensiveness is frenzy premeditated, and frenzy is incensiveness brought into action. Thus he who has subjected desire and incensiveness to the intelligence will find that his desire is changed into pleasure through his soul's unsullied union in grace with the divine, and that his incensiveness is changed into a pure fervor shielding his pleasure in the divine, and into a self-possessed frenzy in which the soul, ravished by longing, is totally rapt in ecstasy above the realm of created beings. But-so long as the world and the soul's willing attachment to material things are alive in us, we must not give freedom to</p>
      <p> desire and incensiveness, lest they commingle with the sensible objects that are cognate to them, and make war against the soul, taking it captive with the passions, as in ancient times the Babylonians took Jerusalem (cf. 2 Kgs. 25:4). For when Scripture, exhibiting the world of mtelligibles through the literal narrative, speaks of an age during which the Law commands servants of another tribe to remain in bondage (cf. Lev. 25:40-41), it means by "age" the attachment of the soul's will and purpose to this world, that is, to this present life.</p>
      <p> 57 Evil has a beginning, for it has its origin in activity on our part which is contrary to nature. But goodness does not have a beginning, for it exists by nature before time and before all ages. Goodness is intelligible because it can be grasped by intellection. Evil is not intelligible because it cannot be grasped-by intellection. Goodness can he spoken about - indeed, it is the only thing we should speak about. It also comes into being - it is, in fact, the only thing that should come into being; for although by nature it is uncreated, yet because of God's love for us it allows itself to come into being through us by grace, so that we who create and speak may be deified. Evil - which is the only thing that should not come into being - we cannot create. Evil is corruptible because corruption is the nature of evil, which does not possess any true existence whatsoever. Goodness is incorruptible because it exists eternally and never ceases to be, and watches over everything in which it dwells. Goodness, then, is what we should seek with our intelligence, long for with our desire, and keep inviolate with our mcensive power.</p>

      <p> With out cognitive insight we should prevent it from being adulterated by anything that is contrary to it. With our voice we should make it manifest in speech to those who art ignorant of it. And with our generative power we should make it increase or, to put it more accurately, we should be increased by it.</p>
      <p> 58. The contemplative intellect, if it is to rule over conceptual images of created things, as well as over its own activities, must be in a state barren of evil, that is, one which neither conceives evil in any way nor gives birth to it. It must be in this state when it embarks on contemplation lest, in scrutinizing created beings spiritually, it inadvertently falls into the power of one of the demons whose nature it is to comipt the heart's pure vision by means of some sensible object.</p>
      <p> 59.  He who on account of his virtue or spiritual knowledge falls victim to self-esteem grows his hair like Absalom, to no good purpose (cf. 2 Sam. 14:26; 18:9). Outwardly he appears to pursue a moral way of life, but it is carefully contrived and mixed (like a mule) with conceit, and designed to deceive onlookers. Puffed up with his vainglory, he tries to supplant the spiritual father who gave him birth through the teaching of the Logos; for in his pride he wants, like a usurper, to arrogate to himself all the splendor of-the virtue and spiritual knowledge which his spiritual father possessed as a gift from God. But when such a man begins to engage in the spiritual contemplation of created beings and to fight with his intelligence for truth, because his sensual nature is still full of life he is caught by his hair in the oak tree of material appearances; and thus his empty conceit, entangled as it is with death, suspends him between heaven and earth (cf. 2 Sam. 18:9). For the victim of self-esteem does not possess spiritual knowledge, which like heaven would draw him up out of his degrading conceit, nor does he possess earth, that basis, rooted m humility, of practical endeavor which would draw him down from the heights to which his arrogance has raised him. The spiritual teacher who gave him birth grieves compassionately on seeing him the (cf 2 Sam. 18:33). In this way his teacher imitates God, who desires not the death of a smner but rather that he should repent and live (cf. Ezek. 33:11).</p>
      <p> 60.  The origin and consummation of every man's salvation is wisdom, which initially produces fear but when perfected gives rise to loving desire. Or, rather, initially and providentially wisdom</p>
      <p> [V2] 226</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> manifests itself for our sake as fear, so as to make us who aspire to wisdom desist from evil; but ultimately it exists in its natural state for its own sake as loving desire, so as to fill with spiritual mirth those who have abandoned all existmg things In order to dwell with it.</p>
      <p> 61. To those who do not long for it, wisdom is fear, because of the loss which they suffer through their flight from it; but in those who cleave to it, wisdom is loving desire, promoting an inner state of joyous activity. For wisdom creates fear, delivering a person from the passions by making him apprehensive of punishment; and it also produces loving desire, accustoming the intellect through the acquisition of the virtues to behold the blessings held in store for us.</p>
      <p> 62.  Every genuine confession humbles the souL When it takes the form of thanksgiving, it teaches the soul that it has been delivered by the grace of God. When it takes the form of self-accusation, it teaches the soul that it is guilty of crimes through its own deliberate indolence.</p>
      <p> 63.  Confession takes two forms. According to the one, we give thanks for blessings received; according to the other, we bring to light and examine what we have done wrong. We use the term confession both for the grateful appreciation of the blessings we have received through divine favor, and for the admission of the evil actions of which we are guilty. Both forms produce humility. For he who thanks God for blessmgs and he who examines himself for his offences are both humbled. The first judges himself unworthy of what he has been given: the second implores forgiveness for his sins.</p>
      <p> 64.  The passion of pride arises from two kinds of ignorance, and when these two kinds of ignorance unite together they form a single confused state of mind. For a man is proud only if he is ignorant both of divine help and of human weakness. Therefore pride is a lack of knowledge both in the divine and in the human spheres. For the denial of two true premises results in a single false affirmation.</p>
      <p> 65.  Self-esteem is the replacing of a purpose which accords with God by another purpose which is contrary to the divine. For a man full of self-esteem pursues virtue not for God's glory but for his own, and so purchases with his labors the worthless praise of men.</p>
      <p> 66.  The person who likes to be popular attends solely to the outward show of morality and to the wards of the flatterer. With the first he hopes to attract the eyes and with the second the ears of those</p>
      <p> [V2] 227</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> Who are charmed and impressed only by what is visible and audible, and who judge virtue only with their senses. Hence the desire to be popular may be described as an outward display of moral acts and language, as though for the sake of virtue but really is to impress other people.</p>
      <p> 67.  Hypocrisy is the pretence of friendship, or hatred hidden in the form of friendship, or enmity-operating under the guise, of affection, or envy simulating the. character of love, or a style of life adorned with the fiction but not the reality of virtue, or the pretence of righteousness maintained only in external appearance, or deceit with the outer form of truth. Hypocrisy is the trade of those who emulate the serpent in their twistmgs and tvvmmgs.</p>
      <p> 68.   God is the cause of created beings and of their inherent goodness. Thus he who is puffed up with his virtue and knowledge, and whose grace-given progress in virtue is not matched by a corresponding recognition of his own weakness, falls inevitably into the sin of pride. He who seeks goodness for the sake of his own reputation prefers himself to God, for he has been pierced by the nail of self-esteem. By doing or speaking what is virtuous in order to be seen by men, he sets a much higher value on the approbation of men than on that of God. In short, he is a victim of the desire to be popular. And he who immorally makes use of morality solely to deceive by his solemn display of virtue, and hides the evil disposition of his will under the outward form of piety, barters virtue for the guile of hypocrisy. He aims at something other than die cause of all things.</p>
      <p> 69.  The demons of pride, self-esteem, desire for popularity, and hypocrisy, never act by trying to dampen the ardor of the virtuous man. Instead, they cunningly reproach him for his shortcomings where the virtues are concerned, and suggest that he intensifies his</p>
      <p> efforts, encouraging him m his struggle; They do this in order to entice him to give his full attention to them: in this way they make him lose a proper balance and moderation, and lead him imperceptibly to a destination other than the one to which he thought he was going.</p>
      <p> 70. Neither do these demons hate self-restraint, fasting, almsgiving, hospitality, the singing of psalms, spiritual reading, stillness, the most sublime doctrines, sleeping on the ground, vigils, or any of the other things which characterize a life lived according to God,</p>
      <p> [V2] 228</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> so long as the aim and purpose of a person trying to live such a life are tilted in their direction.</p>
      <p> 71.  A person pursuing the spiritual way is perhaps quicker to recognize the other demons, and so he more easily escapes the harm that they do, but in the case of the demons that appear to cooperate with the progress of virtue and pretend they want to help in building a temple to the Lord, surely no intellect is so sublime as to recognize them without the assistance of the active and living Logos who pervades all thmgs and pierces 'even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit' (Heb. 4:12) - who discerns, in other words, which acts or conceptual images pertain to the soul, that is, are natural forms or expressions of virtue, and which are spiritual, that is, are supranatural and characteristic of God, but bestowed on nature by grace. It is only the Logos who knows whether 'the joints and marrow", that is, the qualities of virtue and spiritual principles, have been united harmoniously or not, and who judges the intentions and thoughts of the heart  (ibid.),  that is, judges from what is said the invisible underlying disposition and the motives hidden in -the soul. For to Him nothing in us is unseen: however we think we may escape notice, to Him "all things are naked and open' (Heb. 4:13), not only what we do or think, but even what we will do or will think.</p>
      <p> 72.  By 'dividing asunder of soul and spirit' is meant distinguishing between innate virtues, the principles of which we possess by nature, and virtues which are from the Spirit, the grace of which we receive as a free gift. The Logos discriminates with exactness between the two.</p>
      <p> 73.  The intentions and thoughts which the Logos discerns are the soul's relationships with divine principles and thoughts, and the causes of these relationships. For an intention moves the mind, which has such a relationship; and a thought is directed towards a specific end, which in this way acts as a cause.</p>
      <p> 74.  If God is essential knowledge, then God is subordinate to the intellect, for clearly the intellect is prior to all knowledge that it embraces. Therefore God is beyond knowledge because He is infinitely beyond every intellect, whatever the knowledge it embraces.</p>
      <p> 75.  What man without the divine Logos dwelling in the depths of his heart can overcome the invisible wiles of the dissembling</p>
      <p> [V2] 229</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> demons? How can he on his own, keeping himself free of all con- course with them, found and build the temple of the Lord, like Zerubbabel and Joshua and the heads of the clans, who expressly announced to the deceitful spirits of pride, self-esteem, desire for popularity and hypocrisy: 'You cannot share with us in the building of the house for the Lord our God; we alone will build for the Lord of Israel' (1 Esd. 5:70-71)? For concourse with the demons brings about the decay and destruction of the whole building, and strips the grace of beauty from divine offerings.</p>
      <p> 76.   Nobody who accepts, as partners in his struggle for virtue, any of the four demons we have mentioned can build for the Lord. If he does accept any of them, as a result of his efforts he will not find God, but will be confirmed in the passion that he consolidates through his virtue.</p>
      <p> 77.  The demons that wage war on us through our shortcomings in virtue are those that teach unchastity, drunkenness, avarice and envy. Those that wage war on us through our excessive zeal for virtue teach conceit, self-esteem and pride; they secretly pervert what is commendable into what is reprehensible.</p>
      <p> 78.  When the demons attack us invisibly in the guise of spiritual friendship, pretending that they want to accomplish the death of sin by means which m themselves are good, and when they say, "Let us build with you the temple of your Lord', would that we might always reply, "You cannot share with us in the building of the house for the Lord our God; we alone will build for the Lord of Israel' (1 Esd. 5:70-71). 'We alone' because, having been freed from the spirits that fight against us through our shortcomings m virtue, and having escaped from them, we do not now want to be pierced by those that excite our pride by encouraging us to excessive Zeal; because if that happened our fall would be far worse than if we had fallen on account of our shortcomings. For had we fallen for this latter reason, there would have been a good chance of recovering, since we would be forgiven because of our weakness. But recovery is impossible, or at least difficult, if we fall because we have made ourselves hateful through our pride, and in place of what is right have set up something else which we regard as better. Yet m another sense we are not building the temple alone because we have the holy angels to help us to do what is good; indeed, we even have God Himself, who reveals Himself to us through our works of</p>
      <p> [V2] 230</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> righteousness said builds us as a holy temple, fit for Himself and free from every passion.</p>
      <p> 79.  Virtue may be defined as the conscious union of human weakness with divine strength. Thus the person who makes no effort to transcend the weakness of human nature has not yet attained the state of virtue. And that is why he goes astray, because he has not yet received the power which makes what is weak strong. On the other hand, he who willfully relies on his own weakness instead of on divine power, regarding this weakness as strength, has completely overshot the bounds of virtue. And that is why he goes astray, because he is unaware that he has left goodness behind; indeed, he mistakes his error itself for virtue. Thus the person who makes no effort to transcend the limits of his natural weakness is more easily forgiven, because indolence is the main reason for his lapse. But he who relies on his own weakness instead of on divine strength in-order to do what is right, is likely to have lapsed because of willfulness.</p>
      <p> 80.  When it is said that "the just man's prayer, made active, has great strength' (Jas. 5:16), I understand such prayer to be made active in two ways. The first is when the person who offers prayer to God supports it with works performed in accordance with the commandments. When he does this his prayer is not merely a matter of words and of the hollow sound of the tongue, and therefore ineffectual and without real substance, but it is effectual and living, animated with the actual fulfilling of the commandments. For prayer and supplication are given real substance when the commandments are fulfilled through the practice of the virtues. That is why the just man's prayer is strong and has the power to do all things, for it has been made active in this manner. The second way in which a Just man's prayer is made active is when another person asks for his prayers and then actually carries out in practice those things for which he requested the just man to pray; for in such a case this other person "not only corrects his former mode of life but also, through his turn for the better, fills the just man's prayer with dynamic strength.</p>
      <p> 81. No benefit comes from a just man's prayer if he who asks for it finds more pleasure in sin than in virtue. For Samuel mourned over Saul when he sinned, but he was not able to obtain God's mercy, for his grief was not supported by the necessary change of</p>
      <p> [V2]231</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> life on the part of the sinner. Hence God put an end to the pointless grief of His servant, saying to him, "How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?' (1 Sam. 16:1).</p>
      <p> 82.  Again, when the compassionate Jeremiah appealed to God on behalf of the Jewish people because in their madness they deludedly worshipped the demons, his prayer was not heard; for it was not supported by the actual conversion of the godless Jews from their errors. Hence God also made him desist from his profitless prayer, saying:' Do not pray for this people, do not ask for them to be shown mercy, and do not approach Me with farther intercessions on their account, for I will not hear you' (Jer. 7:16. LXX).</p>
      <p> 83.   It is indeed the height of folly, not to say of madness, for a person who deliberately takes pleasure in destructive sins to seek salvation through the prayers of the just and to ask them to obtain forgiveness for what he actively glories in, denied as he is by his own free choice. If he really hates what is evil, he should not ask for the prayers of a just man and then allow them to become void and ineffectual: but he should make them active and strong, so that winged with his own virtues they may reach Him who has power to grant forgiveness for sins.</p>
      <p> 84.   The prayer of a just man has great strength when it is made active either by the just man who offers it or by the person who asks the just man to offer it for him. When it is made active by the just man, his prayer gives him direct communion with God who has the power, to grant what he asks. When the prayer is made active by the person who has asked the just man to pray for him, it delivers him from his evil ways and disposes him to virtue.</p>
      <p> 85.   St Peter says, 'In which you rejoice, even though for a short while you may have to suffer 'distress from various trials' (1 Pet. 1:6). But how can a person in distress because of such trials rejoice in what distresses him?</p>
      <p> 86.  There are two kinds of distress. The first is produced imperceptibly in the soul, the second palpably to-the senses. The first embraces the fall depth of the soul, tormenting it with the lash of conscience; the second pervades all the senses when their natural tendency to turn towards external things is checked by pain. The first kind is the result of sensual pleasure, the second of the soul's felicity. Or rather, the first results from sense experiences that we</p>
      <p> [V2] 232</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> deliberately embrace, the second from those we suffer against our will.</p>
      <p> 87.  Distress, in my opinion, is a state devoid of pleasure. Absence of pleasure means the presence of pain. Pain is clearly a defect in, or a withdrawal of, some natural condition. A defect in some natural condition is a disorder or passion in the faculty that functions naturally in that condition. Such a disorder involves the misuse of the natural function of that faculty in question. To misuse the natural function is to direct the faculty towards what does not exist by nature and lacks substantial being.</p>
      <p> 88.  The soul's distress is the result of sensual pleasure. For it is sensual pleasure that produces distress of soul. Similarly, distress in the flesh is the result of the soul's pleasure. For the soul's felicity is the flesh's distress.</p>
      <p> 89.   There are two kinds of distress. The first involves the senses and consists in the absence of bodily pleasures: the second involves the intellect and consists in the absence of the soul's blessings. Trials, or temptations, are likewise of two kinds, the first subject to our will and the second not subject to our will. Those subject to our will beget bodily pleasure in the senses but distress in the soul. For sin when committed produces distress of soul. Those that are not subject to our will become apparent in sufferings undergone unwillingly; they beget pleasure in the soul but distress in the senses.</p>
      <p> 90.  Just as there are two kinds of distress, as 1 have already explained, so also there are two kinds of trial or temptation, the one willingly accepted and the other contrary to our wishes. The first produces intended pleasure; the second inflicts unintended pain. For temptation willingly accepted leads to pleasures clearly intended by deliberate choice. But a trial undergone contrary to our wishes produces sufferings which are obviously not intended by deliberate choice. The first produces distress in the soul, the second in the senses.</p>
      <p> 91.  Temptation willingly accepted creates distress in the soul, but clearly produces pleasure in the senses. A trial undergone contrary to our wishes produces pleasure in the soul but distress in the flesh.</p>
      <p> 92.  1 think that when our Lord and God was teaching His disciples how to pray and said, 'Lead us not into temptation' (Matt. 6:13), He was teaching them to pray that they should reject the kind of temptation which .we accept willingly, that is, to pray that</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> they should not be abandoned to the experience of temptations which, when wilhngly accepted, lead to intended pleasures. But I think that when St James, called the brother of the Lord, was teaching those struggling for truth not to be afraid, and said, "My brethren, regard it as a great joy when various trials befall you' (Jas. 1:2), he was speaking with reference to the kind of trial which is not subject to our will, that is, to trials which are contrary to our wishes and produce suffering. That both these interpretations are correct is clear from the fact that the Lord at once adds, "But deliver us from the evil one", and that James continues: "Knowing that the testing of your faith produces patient endurance, and let this endurance come to truition, so that you may be perfect and entire, lacking nothing' (Jas. 1:3-4).</p>
      <p> 93.   The Lord teaches us to pray that we may reject temptations subject to our will because these produce pleasure in the flesh and pain in the soul. St James urges us to rejoice in trials contrary to our wishes because these banish pleasure from the flesh and pain from the soul.</p>
      <p> 94.  A perfect man is one who by means of self-control fights against temptations subject to his will, and who endures with patience trials that are contrary to his wishes. And an entire man is one whose practice of the virtues is completed by spiritual knowledge, and whose contemplation does not remain without practical effect.</p>
      <p> 95.  Since distress and pleasure each affect both the soul and the senses, he who cultivates the soul's pleasure and patiently accepts the distress of the senses becomes tested, perfect and entire. He is tested by experiencing the contrasting effects of pleasure and distress in the senses. He becomes perfect because he fights unremittingly against pleasure and distress in the senses with self-control and patience. He becomes entire because, through constant obedience to the intelligence, he maintains the conditions that combat the mutually conflicting experiences of pleasure and distress in the senses. By these conditions I mean the practice of the virtues and contemplation, which he holds together without allowing the one to be in the least disjoined from the other: his actions manifest his contemplative knowledge and his-contemplation is protected equally by the intelligence and by the practice of the virtues.</p>
      <p> 96.  He who has had experience of the distress and pleasure of the</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> flesh may be described as tested because he has experienced both the pleasant and the unpleasant aspects of the flesh. A perfect man is one who with the power of his intelligence has struggled against the pleasure and pam of the flesh and has overcome them. An entire man is one who keeps both his practice of the virtues and his contemplative life unvarying through the intensity of his longing for God.</p>
      <p> 97.  Distress of soul is of two kinds. The first is distress for one's own sins: the second is distress for the sins of others. The cause of such distress is clearly the sensual pleasure either of the man who feels distress or of those about whom he is distressed. For strictly speaking there is scarcely ever any sin in man that is not first generated by the soul's witless attachment to the senses for the sake of pleasure. And the cause of pleasure in a man's soul is obviously the distress which he feels in his senses when he delights and rejoices in his own virtues or in those of others. For again strictly speaking there is scarcely any virtue in man unless it is first generated by the soul's deliberate detachment from the senses.</p>
      <p> 98.  When the soul is free of all impassioned attachment to the senses, there is no sin whatsoever in man. Moreover, all distress of soul is preceded by pleasure in the flesh.</p>
      <p> 99.  The true origin of virtue lies in the soul's voluntary estrangement from the flesh. And the person who subdues the flesh with voluntary sufferings imbues his soul with spiritual delight.</p>
      <p> 100.  When the soul has achieved detachment from the senses for the sake of virtue, the senses will of necessity suffer, for the soul's capacity for devising pleasure will no longer be conjoined with them in a deliberately chosen relationship. On the contrary, the soul will now bravely repulse the assaults of natural sensual pleasure with self-control; through patient endurance it will implacably resist the attacks of unnatural and involuntary suffering; it will not abandon the godlike dignity and glory of virtue for pleasure which has no real substance; and it will not fall from the heights of virtue in order to spare the flesh by relieving it of the sufferings induced by the pain of the senses. For the cause of distress in the senses is the soul's complete concentration on what accords with nature; and the pleasure of the senses is clearly supported by whatever activity of the soul is contrary to nature, for such pleasure can have no principle of existence other than the soul's rejection of what accords with nature.</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> 1.   The soul has an intellectual capacity that is purposeful and inventive. When this capacity is separated from its attachment to the senses, it no longer seeks to satisfy the longing of the flesh for pleasure, as it did previously by virtue of their deliberately chosen relationship. Since its entire attention and intention are now fixed on divine realities, it refuses to assuage the flesh's suffering.</p>
      <p> 2.  The natural energies of the intellect and those of the senses are opposed to one another because of the extreme dissimilarity between their objects. The intellect has as its object noetic and incorporeal beings, whose essence it is by nature fitted to apprehend: the senses have as object sensible and corporeal entities, which they likewise apprehend by virtue of their natural powers.</p>
      <p> 3.  The origin of sensual pleasure lies in the soul's rejection of what accords with nature. For when the soul devotes its whole strength to the realization of blessings which accord with nature, it has no capacity for seeking out sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> 4.  When the intelligence takes precedence over the senses in the contemplation of visible things, the flesh is deprived of all natural pleasures, because the senses are then kept under control by the intelligence and so are not free to pursue their own pleasures. Once the intelligence is dominant in us, the flesh necessarily suffers, because the intelligence compels it into the service of virtue.</p>
      <p> 5.   When the intellect regards the senses as its own natural power, it becomes entangled in the superficial aspects of sensible things and devises ways of enjoying the pleasures of the flesh. It is unable to transcend the nature of visible things because it is held back by its impassioned attachment to the senses.</p>
      <p> 6.  It can sometimes happen that the intellect is unable to advance to the apprehension of the noetic realities akin to it except by</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> way of the contemplation of the intervening sensible objects. But such contemplation is impossible without the senses, which are linked to the intellect, yet are naturally akin to sensible objects. As a result the intellect, on encountering the superficial aspects of visible things, may well become entangled with them, thinking that the sense-perception linked with it is its own natural activity. If this occurs, the intellect will fall away from the noetic realities which accord with its nature and will grasp with both hands, so to speak, the corporeal entities which are contrary to its intelligence; and, because of the victory which the senses have gained over it, the intellect will fill the soul with distress. For it will be seared by the whips of conscience because it has become the author of sensual pleasure and coarsened itself with thoughts of how to pamper the flesh. But if on the other hand the intellect cuts through the superficial aspects of visible things as soon as they strike the senses, it will contemplate the spiritual essences of created things stripped of their outer forms. Then it will produce pleasure in the soul, because the soul will not be dominated by any of the sensible objects which are contemplated; but in the senses it will produce distress, because they will be deprived of every natural sensible object.</p>
      <p> Sense-pleasure produces distress or suffering in the soul - the two terms mean the same. The soul's pleasure, on the other hand, produces distress or suffering in the senses. Thus he who longs in hope for life in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, through the resurrection of the dead 'to an inheritance which is incorruptible, pure and unfading, kept in heaven" (1 Pet. 1:4), will exult and feel unutterable joy in his soul, for he will be unceasingly full of gladness because of his hope for the blessings held in store; but in his flesh and senses he will experience distress, that is to say, the suffering produced by various trials and temptations, and the pain which goes with them. For pleasure and suffering accompany every virtue - suffering in the flesh when it is deprived of its agreeable lubncious sensuality, and pleasure in the soul, as it delights in spiritual essences stripped of everything sensible.</p>
      <p> In this present life - for that is what 1 take 'this present time' to mean - the intellect must feel distress with respect to the flesh, because of the many sufferings resulting from the trials and temptations that beset it in its struggle for virtue; but it must always rejoice with respect to the soul, and delight in the hope of eternal</p>
      <p> [V2] 237</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> blessings, even though its senses are burdened with suffering. For 'the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us" (Rom. 8:18), says St Paul.</p>
      <p> 9.  The flesh belongs to the soul, but the soul does not belong to the flesh. For the lesser belongs to the greater, not the greater to the lesser. But the law of sin - which is sensual pleasure - has become interlaced with the flesh through the fall. Because of this the flesh has been condemned to suffer death, for the purpose of death is to destroy the law of the flesh. Hence the man who knows that because of sin death was introduced, in order to destroy sin, always rejoices in his soul when he sees that, as a result of his many sufferings, the law of sin is withdrawing from his flesh, thus preparing him to receive in the spirit the blessed life that is held in store. For unless in this present life the law of sin, evidenced in the will's attachment to the flesh, is drained from the flesh as though from some vessel, no one can receive that blessed life.</p>
      <p> 10.  He who is full of distress with respect to his flesh because of the sufferings he endures for the sake of virtue, rejoices in his soul because of that very virtue: for he beholds as a present reality the beauty of the blessings held in store. For the sake of virtue he severs his will from the flesh, and so dies daily, like David (cf Ps. 44:22). At the same time, he is continually renewed through his soul's spiritual regeneration; for he possesses both salutary pleasure and profitable distress. By this distress I do not mean that witless distress felt by most people, which torments their soul because, after developing unnatural impulses towards what it should reject and an aversion for what it should not reject, it then finds itself bereft of passions and material things. On the contrary, I have in mind the distress which is purposive and approved by those endowed with divine wisdom, and which indicates the presence of something evil. For distress is defined as evil present: and it is produced in the soul when sensual pleasure predominates over intelligent discrimination. But it is produced in the senses when the soul pursues the path of virtue unhindered; indeed, it induces as much suffering in the senses as it creates pleasure and joy in the soul that is brought near to God through the illumination conferred upon it by virtue and spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 11.  Salutary pleasure is the soul's joy on account of virtue.</p>
      <p> [V2] 238</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> while profitable distress is the pain the flesh suffers for the sake of virtue. Moreover, he who has given himself up to passions and material things generates impulses towards what he should not desire: while he who does not welcome the calamities that deprive him of passions and material things creates an aversion for what he should desire.</p>
      <p> 12. Divine grace cannot actualize the illumination of spiritual knowledge unless there is a natural faculty capable of receiving the illumination. But that faculty itself cannot actualize the illumination without the grace which God bestows.</p>
      <p> 13.   Not even the grace of the Holy Spirit can actualize wisdom in the saints unless there is an intellect capable of receiving it: or spiritual knowledge unless there is a faculty of intelligence that can receive it: or faith unless there is in the intellect and the intelligence full assurance about the realities to be disclosed hereafter and until then hidden from everyone: or gifts of healing unless there is natural compassion: or any other gift of grace without the disposition and faculty capable of receiving it. On the other hand, a man cannot acquire a single one of these gifts with his natural faculties unless aided by the divine power that bestows them. All the saints show that God's grace does not suspend man's natural powers: for, after receiving revelations of divine realities, they inquired into the spiritual principles contained in what had been revealed to them.</p>
      <p> 14.  If a person asks without passion, he will receive the grace to enable him to practice the virtues. And if he seeks with dispassion, he will through natural contemplation find the truth inherent in created beings. And if he dispassionately knocks on the door of spiritual knowledge, he will without hindrance attain the hidden grace of mystical theology (cf Matt. 7:7-8).</p>
      <p> 15.  He who dispassionately seeks for what is divine will certainly receive what he seeks. He who seeks with any passion will fail to find what he seeks. For Scripture says, 'You ask, and do not receive, because you ask. wrongly' (Jas. 4:3).</p>
      <p> 16.  The Holy Spirit within us searches out the spiritual knowledge of created beings. But He does not search it out for Himself, because He is God and beyond all knowledge: on the contrary. He searches it out for our sakes, who are in need of such knowledge. Similarly the Logos, when He accomplished His mystery through the flesh, became flesh not for Himself but for us. Yet just as the Logos,</p>
      <p> [V2] 239</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> as befits God, did not actualize what naturally pertains to the flesh without assuming flesh endowed with soul and intellect, so the Holy Spirit does not actualize in the saints a spiritual knowledge of the mysteries apart from that faculty in them which naturally searches out such knowledge.</p>
      <p> 17.  Just as it is impossible for the eye to perceive sensible objects without the light of the sun, so the human intellect cannot engage in spiritual contemplation without the light of the Spirit. For physical light naturally illuminates the senses so that they may perceive physical bodies; while spiritual light illumines the intellect so that it can engage in contemplation and thus grasp what lies beyond the senses.</p>
      <p> 18.  The faculties which search out divine realities were implanted by the Creator in the essence of human nature at its very entrance into being; but divine realities themselves are revealed to man through grace by the power of the Holy Spirit descending upon him. When, as a result of the fall, the devil had riveted the attention of these faculties to visible things, nobody understood or sought out God, because in all who participated in human nature intellect and intelligence were confined to the superficial aspects of sensible things, and so they acquired no understanding of what lies beyond the senses. But then, in those who had not of their own free will become inwardly subject to deceit, the grace of the Holy Spirit broke the attachment of these faculties to material things and restored them to their original state. On receiving them back thus purified, men again sought out divine realities, and they have continued to search them out through the same grace of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> 19.  The soul's salvation is the consummation of faith (cf 1 Pet. 1:9). This consummation is the revelation of what has been believed. Revelation is the inexpressible interpenetration of the believer with the object of belief and takes place according to each believer's degree of faith (cf. Rom. 12:6). Through that interpenetration the believer finally returns to his origin. This return is the fulfillment of desire. Fulfillment of desire is ever-active repose in the object of desire. Such repose is eternal uninterrupted enjoyment of this object. Enjoyment of this kind entails participation in supra-natural divine realities. This participation consists in the participant becoming like that in which he participates. Such likeness involves.</p>
      <p> [V2] 240</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> so far as this is possible, an identity with respect to energy between the participant and that in which he participates by virtue of the hkeness. This identity with respect to energy constitutes the deification of the saints. Deification, briefly, is the encompassing and fulfillment of all times and ages, and of all that exists in either. This encompassing and fulfillment is the union, in the person granted salvation, of his real authentic origin with his real authentic consummation. This union presupposes a transcending of all that by nature is essentially limited by an origin and a consummation. Such transcendence is effected by the almighty and more than powerful energy of God, acting in a direct and infinite manner in the person found worthy of this transcendence. The action of this divine energy bestows a more than ineffable pleasure and joy on him in whom the unutterable and unfathomable union with the divine is accomplished. This, in the nature of things, cannot be perceived, conceived or expressed.</p>
      <p> 20.  Nature does not contain the inner principles of what is beyond nature any more than it contains the laws of what is contrary to nature. By what is beyond nature I mean the divine and inconceivable pleasure which God naturally produces in those found worthy of being united with Him through grace. By what is contrary to nature I mean the indescribable pain brought about by the privation of such pleasure. This pain God naturally produces in the unworthy when He is united to them in a manner contrary to grace. For God is united with all men according to the underlying quality of their inner state: and, at the creation of each person. He provides each person with the capacity to perceive and sense Him when He is united in one way or another with all men at the end of the ages.</p>
      <p> 21.  The Holy Spirit leads those who seek the spiritual principles and qualities of salvation to an understanding of them: for He does not allow the power with which they naturally seek divine things to remain inactive and unproductive in them.</p>
      <p> 22.  First a man seeks to make his will dead to sin and sin dead to his will, and to this end he investigates how and by what means he should make these two dead to one another. When that has been done, he seeks to make his will alive in virtue and virtue alive in his will: and to this end he investigates how and by what means he should vivify each in the other. To seek is to have an appetite for</p>
      <p> [V2] 241</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> some object of desire; to investigate is to employ effective means by which the appetite can attain that object.</p>
      <p> 23.  He who is to be saved must make not only sin dead to his will but also his will dead to sin. He must resurrect not only his will by means of virtue but also virtue by means of his will. In this way the will, being put to death and entirely disjoined from the totality of sin, which likewise has been put to death, becomes impervious to sin, while as revivified it becomes wholly conscious, through its unbroken union with it, of the totality of virtue, which itself has been revivified. For he who has made his will dead to sin has been united with the likeness of the death of Christ; and he who has given his will new life through righteousness has also become one with His resurrection (cf Rom. 6:5j.</p>
      <p> 24.  When sin and will become dead to each other they become mutually impervious to each other; and when righteousness and will have life in each other they become mutually conscious of each other.</p>
      <p> 25.  Christ is by nature both God and man. In an ineffable and supernatural manner we participate by grace in Him as God, while He in His incomprehensible love for men shares as man in our lot for our sake by making Himself one with us with a form like ours. The saints foresaw Him mystically in the Spirit and were taught that the glory to be revealed in Christ in the future because of His virtue must be preceded by the sufferings which He would endure for the sake of virtue (cf. 1 Pet. 1:11).</p>
      <p> 26.  When the intellect in its longing is drawn in a manner beyond its understanding towards the source of created beings, it simply seeks; when the intelligence explores in various ways the true essences in created beings, it investigates.</p>
      <p> 27.  Seeking is the intellect's first, simple, fervent movement towards its own cause. Investigating is the intelligence's first, simple discernment of its own cause with the help of some concept. Again, seeking occurs when the intellect, spurred on by intense longing, moves spiritually, and in cognitive awareness, towards its own cause. Investigating occurs when the intelligence, through the operation of the virtues, discerns its own cause with the help of some wise and profound concept.</p>
      <p> 28.   While the holy and divine prophets were seeking out and investigating all that is connected with the salvation of souls, the</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> movement of their intellects towards God was spurred on by their longing and kept fervent with cognitive insight and spiritual knowledge; and the discriminative power of their intelligence, in its active discernment of divine realities, was full of understanding and wisdom. Those who imitate them will also seek the salvation of souls with cognitive insight and spiritual knowledge: and by investigating with understanding and wisdom they will be able to discern the works of God.</p>
      <p> 29.  The intelligence recognizes two kinds of knowledge of divine realities. The first is relative, because it is confined to the intelligence and its intellections, and does not entail any real perception, through actual experience, of what is known. In our present life we are governed by this kind of knowledge. The second is true and authentic knowledge. Through experience alone and through grace it brings about, by means of participation and without the help of the intelligence and its intellections, a total and active perception of what is known. It is through this second kind of knowledge that, when we come into our inheritance, we receive supernatural and ever-activated deification. The relative knowledge that resides in the intelligence and its intellections is said to stimulate our longing for the real knowledge attained by participation. This real knowledge, which through experience and participation brings about a perception of what is known, supersedes the knowledge that resides in the intelligence and the intellections.</p>
      <p> 30.  Knowledge, that is to say, is of two kinds. The first resides in the intelligence and its divine intellections, and does not include, in terms of actual vision, a perception of what is known. The second consists solely in the actual enjoyment of divine realities through direct vision, without the help of the intelligence and its intellections. But the intelligence is capable of giving us an intimation of what can be known through true knowledge and so of arousing in us a longing for such knowledge.</p>
      <p> 31.  According to the wise, we cannot use our intelligence to think about God at the same time as we experience Him, or have an intellection of Him while we are perceiving Him directly. By "think about God" I mean speculate about Him on the basis of an analogy between Him and created beings. By 'perceiving Him directly" I mean experiencing divine or supernatural realities through participation. By 'an intellection of Him" I mean the simple and unitary</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> knowledge of God which is derived from created beings. What we have said is confirmed by the fact that, in general, our experience of a thing puts a stop to our thinking about it, and our direct perception of it supersedes our intellection of it. By 'experience" I mean spiritual knowledge actualized on a level that transcends all thought; and by 'direct perception" I mean a supra-intellective participation in what is known. Perhaps this is what St Paul mystically teaches when he says, 'As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for speaking in tongues, this will cease; as for knowledge, it too will vanish" (1 Cor. 13:8); for he is clearly referring here to the knowledge gained by the intelligence through thought and intellection.</p>
      <p> 32.  It was indeed indispensable that He who is by nature the Creator of the being of all things should Himself, through grace, accomplish their deification, and in this way reveal Himself to be not only the author of being but also the giver of eternal well-being. Every creature is totally ignorant both of its own essential being and of that of every other created thing; in consequence no created thing has by nature foreknowledge of anything that will come into existence. Only God has such foreknowledge, and He transcends created things. For He knows what He is in His essence and He knows of the existence of everything made by Him before it comes into being; and it is His purpose to endow created things through grace with a knowledge both of their own essential being and of that of other things; for He will reveal to them the inner principles of their creation, pre-existent in a unified manner within Himself.</p>
      <p> 33.   When God the Logos created human nature He did not make the senses susceptible either to pleasure or to pain; instead. He implanted in it a certain noetic capacity through which men could enjoy Him in an inexpressible way. By this capacity I mean the intellect's natural longing for God. But on his creation the first man, through an initial movement towards sensible objects, transferred this longing to his senses, and through them began to experience pleasure in a way which is contrary to nature. Whereupon God in His providential care for our salvation implanted pain in us as a kind of chastising force; and so through pain the law of death was wisely rooted in the body, thus setting limits to the intellect's manic longing, directed, in a manner contrary to nature, towards sensible objects.</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> 34.   Pleasure and pain were not created simultaneously with the flesh. On the contrary, it was the fall that led man to conceive and pursue pleasure in a way that corrupted his power of choice, and that also brought upon him, by way of chastisement, the pain that leads to the dissolution of his nature. Thus because of pleasure sin became the freely chosen death of the soul; and pain, by means of this dissolution, brought about the disintegration of the material form of the flesh. For God has providentially given man pain he has not chosen, together with the death that follows from it, in order to chasten him for the pleasure he has chosen.</p>
      <p> 35.  Because of the meaningless pleasure which invaded human nature, a purposive pain, in the form of multiple sufferings, also gained entrance. It is in and from these sufferings that death takes its origin. Such pain drives out unnatural pleasure, but does not totally destroy it. Its total destruction is effected by the grace of divine pleasure when this is active in the intellect.</p>
      <p> 36.  Sufferings freely embraced and those that come unsought drive out pleasure and allay its impetus. But they do not destroy the capacity for pleasure which resides in human nature like a natural law. For the cultivation of virtue produces dispassion in one's will but not in one's nature. But when dispassion has been attained in one's will the grace of divine pleasure becomes active in the intellect.</p>
      <p> 37.  All suffering has as its cause some pleasure which has preceded it. Hence all suffering is a debt which those who share in human nature pay naturally in return for pleasure. For suffering naturally follows unnatural pleasure in all men whose generation has been preceded by submission to the rule of causeless pleasure. I describe the pleasure that derives from the fall as 'causeless' because clearly it has not come about as the result of any previous suffering.</p>
      <p> 38.   Once human nature had submitted to the syndrome of pleasure freely chosen followed by pain imposed against one's will, it would have been completely impossible for it to be restored to its original life had the Creator not become man and accepted by His own free choice the pain intended as a chastisement for man's freely chosen pleasure. But in His case the pain was not preceded by generation according to the rule of pleasure. In this way, by accepting a birth which did not originate in pleasure, it was possible for Him to liberate birth from the penalty imposed on it.</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> 39. After the fall the generation of every man was by nature impassioned and preceded by pleasure. From this rule no one was exempt. On the contrary, as if discharging a natural debt, all underwent sufferings and the death that comes from them. None could find the way to freedom, for all were under the tyranny of ill-gotten pleasure, and so subject to justly deserved sufferings and the still more justly deserved death which they engender. Because of this, another kind of suffering and death had to be conceived, first to destroy the ill-gotten pleasure and the justly deserved sufferings consequent on it - sufferings which have pitiably brought about man's disintegration, since his life originates in the corruption that comes from his generation through pleasure and ends in the corruption that comes through death: and, second, to restore suffering human nature. This other kind of suffering and death was both unjust and undeserved: undeserved because it was in no way generated by preceding pleasure, and unjust because it was not the consequence of any passion-dominated life. This other kind of suffering and death, however, had to be devised so that, intervening between ill-gotten pleasure and justly deserved suffering and death, it could completely abolish the pleasure-provoked origin of human life and its consequent termination in death, and thus free it from the pleasure-pain syndrome. It would then recover its original blessedness, unpolluted by any of the characteristics inherent in beings subject to generation and decay.</p>
      <p> That is why the Logos of God, being by nature fully God, became fully man, with a nature constituted like ours of a soul endowed with intellect and a body capable of suffering: only in His case this nature was without sin, because His birth in time from a woman was not preceded by the slightest trace of that pleasure arising from the primal disobedience. In His love He deliberately accepted the painful death which, because of pleasure, terminates human life, so that by suffering unjustly He might abolish the pleasure-provoked and unjust origin by which this life is dominated. For, unlike that of everyone else, the Lord's death was not the payment of a debt incurred because of pleasure, but was on the contrary a challenge thrown down to pleasure: and so through this death He utterly destroys that justly deserved death which ends human life. For the cause of His being was not the illicit pleasure, justly punished by death, through which death entered into human life.</p>
      <p> [V2] 246</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> 40. The Lord is wise, just and mighty by nature. Because He is wise. He could not be ignorant of the way in which to heal human nature. Because He is just. He could not save man, whose will was in the grip of sin, in a tyrannical fashion. Because He is almighty. He could not prove unequal to the task of completing His healing</p>
      <p> 41.  The wisdom of God is revealed in His becoming by nature a true man. His justice is shown by His assumption, at His nativity, of a passible nature identical to our own. His might is shown by His creation, through His suffering and death, of a life that is by nature eternal and of a state of dispassion that is immutable.</p>
      <p> 42.   The Lord revealed His wisdom by the way in which He healed man, becoming man without the slightest change or mutation. He demonstrated the equity of justice when in His self-abasement He submitted deliberately to the sentence to which what is passible in human nature is subject, and made that sentence a weapon for the destruction of sin and of the death which comes through sin - that is, for the destruction of pleasure and of the pain which pleasure engenders. It was in this pleasure-pain syndrome that the dominion of sin and death lay: the tyranny of sin committed in pursuit of pleasure, and the lordship of the painful death consequent upon sin. For the dominion of pleasure and pain clearly applies to what is passible in human nature. And we seek how to alleviate through pleasure the penalty of pain, thus in the nature of things increasing the penalty. For in our desire to escape pain we seek refuge in pleasure, and so try to bring relief to our nature, hard pressed as it is by the torment of pain. But through trying in this way to blunt pain with pleasure, we but increase our sum of debts, for we cannot enjoy pleasure that does not lead to pain and suffering.</p>
      <p> 43.   The Lord gave clear evidence of His supreme power in what He endured from hostile forces when He endowed human nature with an incorruptible form of generation. For through His passion He conferred dispassion, through suffering repose, and through death eternal life. By His privations in the flesh He re-established and renewed the human state, and by His own incarnation He bestowed on human nature the supranatural grace of deification.</p>
      <p> 44.  God became true man and bestowed on human nature a new or second form of generation leading us through suffering to the pleasure of the life held in store for us. For when our forefather</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> Adam broke the divine commandment, in the place of the original form of generation he conceived and introduced into human nature, at the prompting of the serpent, another form, originating in pleasure and terminating through suffering in death. This pleasure was not the consequence of antecedent suffering but, rather, resulted in suffering. And because he introduced this ill-gotten pleasure-provoked form of generation, he deservedly brought on himself, and on all men bom in the flesh from him, the doom of death through suffering. Thus, when the Lord became man and created in human nature a new form of generation, accomplished by the Holy Spirit, He accepted that death through suffering, justly deserved in the case of Adam, but in His case not deserved at all because His own generation was not provoked by the ill-gotten pleasure introduced by our forefather through his disobedience; and by doing so He destroyed whatever in the origin and doom of human generation according to Adam was not initially from God, and made all those who were reborn spiritually from Him free from its guilt.</p>
      <p> 45.  The Lord removed the pleasure which arises from the law of sin, in order to nullify the effects of generation according to the flesh in those reborn in Him by grace through the Spirit. For when the pleasure of generation inherited from Adam is no longer active within them, but only the pain that arose because of Adam, He allows them to experience death, which was originally a sentence imposed on human nature as a penalty for sin: but in their case it is not a debt payable for sin, but an event that God in His providence permits, because of their natural condition, for the purpose of destroying sin. For when death is not bom of that pleasure whose chastisement is its natural function, it begets eternal life. For just as Adam's life of pleasure gave birth to death and corruption, so the Lord's death on account of Adam, being unconditioned by the pleasure that originated in Adam, was the genitor of eternal life.</p>
      <p> 46.  After the fall human life was generated by means of pleasure-provoked conception through sperm and of birth into the world of transience: and it ended in painful death through corruption. But the Lord was not generated in the flesh in the same manner, nor was He conquered by death.</p>
      <p> 47.  Sin first enticed Adam and tricked him into breaking the commandment; and by giving substance to sensual pleasure and by</p>
      <p> [V2] 248</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> attaching itself through such pleasure to the very root of nature, it brought the sentence of death on all nature, since through man it impels all created things towards death. All this was contrived by the devil, that spawn of sin and father of iniquity who through pride expelled himself from divine glory, and through envy of us and of God expelled Adam from paradise (cf. Wisd. 2:24), in order to destroy the works of God and dissolve what had been brought into existence.</p>
      <p> 48.  Since the devil is jealous both of us and of God, he persuaded man by guile that God was jealous of him (cf. Gen. 3:6), and so made him break the commandment. The devil is jealous of God lest His power should be seen actually divinizing man: and he is jealous of man lest through the attainment of virtue man should become a personal participant in divine gloiy. The foul thing is jealous not only of us, because of the glory which we attain with God through virtue, but also of God, because of that power, worthy of all praise, with which He accomplishes our salvation.</p>
      <p> 49.  In Adam the sentence of death was imposed on nature (cf Gen. 2:17), since sensual pleasure had become the principle of its generation. In Christ it was on sin that the sentence of death was imposed (cf Rom. 8:3), for in Christ nature was given a new form of generation, unconditioned by sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> 50.  If we who have been given the honor of becoming the house of God (cf Heb. 3:6) by grace through the Spirit must patiently endure suffering for the sake of righteousness (cf. Heb. 10:36) in order to condemn sin, and must readily submit like criminals to insolent death even though we are good, 'what will be the fate of those who refuse to obey the Gospel of God?" (1 Pet. 4:17). That is to say, what will be the fate or sentence of those who not only have diligently kept that pleasure-provoked, nature-dominating Adamic form of generation alive and active in their soul and body, will and nature, right up to the end; but who also accept neither God the Father, who summons them through His incarnate Son, nor the Son and Mediator Himself, the ambassador of the Father (cf. 1 Tim. 2:5)? To reconcile us with the Father, at His Father's wish the Son deliberately gave Himself to death on our behalf so that, just as He consented to be dishonored for our sake by assuming our passions, to an equal degree He might glorify us with the beauty of His own divinity.</p>

      <p> 5L God is the limitless, eternal and infinite abode of those who attain salvation. He is all things to all men according to their degree of righteousness; or, rather. He has given Himself to each man according to the measure in which each man, in the light of spiritual knowledge, has endured suffering in this life for the sake of righteousness. Thus He resembles the soul that reveals its activity in the members of the body according to the actual capacity of each member, and that itself keeps the members in being and sustains their life. This being the case, 'where will the ungodly and the sinner appear' (1 Pet. 4:18) if he is deprived of such grace? For if a man cannot receive the active presence of God on which his well-being depends, and so fails to attain the divine life that is beyond age, time and place, where will he be?</p>
      <p> 52.  If a person refuses to allow God, the abode of all who are saved and source of their well-being, to sustain his life and to assure his well-being, what will become of him? And if the righteous man will be saved only with much difficulty (cf. Prov. 11:31. LXX: 1 Pet. 4:18), what will become of the man who has not attained any principle of devotion and virtue in this present life?</p>
      <p> 53.  By a single infinitely powerful act of will God in His goodness will gather all together, angels and men, the good and the evil. But, although God pervades all things absolutely, not all will participate in Him equally: they will participate in Him according to what they are.</p>
      <p> 54.  All, whether angels or men, who in everything have maintained a natural justice in their disposition, and have made themselves actively receptive to the inner principles of nature in a way that accords with the universal principle of well-being, will participate totally in the divine life that irradiates them; for they have submitted their will to God's will. Those who in all things have failed to maintain a natural justice in their disposition, and have been actively disruptive of the inner principles of nature in a way that conflicts with the universal principle of well-being, will lapse completely from divine life, in accordance with their dedication to what lacks being; for they have opposed their will to God's will. It is this that separates them from God, for the principle of well-being, vivified by good actions and illumined by divine life, is not operative in their will.</p>
      <p> 55.  The scales on which the disposition of each being, whether</p>
      <p> [V2] 250</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> angel or man, will be weighed at the last judgment is the principle of nature, which shows clearly whether that angel or man inclines towards well-being or its opposite. It is in accordance with this inclination that each being participates or fails to participate in divine life. For God will gather together into His presence all angels and men according to their being and their eternal being. But He will gather together in a special way according to their eternal well-being only those who are holy, leaving to those who are not holy eternal lack of well-being as the mixed fruit of their disposition.</p>
      <p> 56.  In the mystery of the divine incarnation the distinction between the two natures, divine and human, in Christ does not imply that He is divided into two persons. On the one hand, a fourth person is not added to the Trinity, which would be the case if the incarnate Christ was divided into two persons: while on the other hand, since nothing can be coessential or cognate with the Divinity, there must be a distinction between the divine and human natures in Him. In other words, in the incarnation the two natures have united to form a single person, not a single nature. Thus not only does the hypostatic union formed by the coming together of the two natures constitute a perfect unity, but also the different elements which come together in the indivisible union retain their natural character, free from all change and confusion.</p>
      <p> 57.  With regard to Christ, we do not speak of a distinction of persons, because the Trinity remained a Trinity after the incarnation of the Logos. A fourth person was not added to the Holy Trinity as a result of the incarnation. We speak of a distinction of natures to avoid asserting that the flesh is coessential in its nature with the Logos.</p>
      <p> 58.  He who does not distinguish the two natures in Christ has no basis for affirming that the Logos became flesh without change. He does not acknowledge that after the union that which assumed and that which was assumed are preserved according to their nature in the single person of the one Christ, our God and Savior.</p>
      <p> 59.  There is after the union a distinction in Christ between the nature of His flesh and that of His divinity, for divinity and flesh are never identical in their essence. Hence the union of the two elements, divine and human, which have come together has generated not a single nature, but a single person. With regard to this person, there is no distinction in Christ of any kind whatsoever, for</p>
      <p> [V2] 251</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> as a person the Logos is identical with His own flesh. Had there been such a distinction in Christ, He could not be one person in every way. Where the person of Christ is concerned. His oneness does not admit of any kind of distinction whatsoever, and in every way it is, and is affirmed to be, a unity for all eternity.</p>
      <p> 60.  With the help of hope, faith perfects our love for God. By making us keep the commandments, a clear conscience gives substance to our love for our neighbor. For a clear conscience cannot be charged with the breaking of a commandment. Only those who seek true salvation believe in their hearts in these three things, faith, hope and love.</p>
      <p> 61.  Nothing is swifter than believing, and nothing is easier than to confess orally the grace that comes from what has been believed. It is his belief that reveals the believer's living love for his Creator; it is his confession of the grace received that reveals his godly affection for his neighbor. Love and genuine affection - that is, faith and a clear conscience - are clearly the result of a hidden impulse of the heart; for the heart is fully able to generate without using external matter.</p>
      <p> 62.  If a person's will is not directed towards what is good, it is inevitably directed towards evil; for it cannot be stationary with regard to both. Because it implies obduracy with regard to virtue Scripture describes the soul's sluggishness in pursuing what is good as 'stones'; while it describes as 'timber" the soul's readiness to commit evil (cf. Zech. 5:4). But sense perception allied with the activity of the intellect produces virtue with spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 63.  By "dividing wall' (Eph. 2:14) Scripture means the natural law of the body, and by "barrier"  (ibid.)  that attachment to the passions according to the law of the flesh which constitutes sin. For attachment to shameful passions is a barrier set up by the law of nature - of the passible aspect of nature - walling off soul from body, and preventing a person from practicing the virtues in such a way that by means of the soul their principle passes into the flesh. Once their principle has passed into the flesh and has overthrown the law of nature - of the passible aspect of nature - it destroys the attachment to unnatural passions which that law imposes.</p>
      <p> 64.  When through his guile the devil pillages the knowledge of God inherent in nature and arrogates it to himself, he is a thief, because he is attempting to transfer devotion from God to himself.</p>
      <p> [V2] 252</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> This he does by diverting the inteUect from its contemplation of the spiritual essences of created things and by limiting its scope merely to their superficial visible aspects. Then, after perverting the soul's natural functions, he speciously impels it to practice what is contrary to nature: by means of what appears to be good he persuasively attaches its desire to what is evil, and by swearing falsely on the name of the Lord he leads the soul thus persuaded towards things other than those he has promised. He is a thief because he arrogates the spiritual knowledge of nature to himself; he is a perjurer because he persuades the soul to labor to no purpose for what is contrary to nature.</p>
      <p> 65.   A thief is a man who in order to deceive his hearers pretends to reverence divine principles. Although he has not come to know the true quality of these principles through his actions, he traffics in glory merely by speaking about it, hoping that in this manner he will be thought righteous by his hearers and so capture their admiration. To put it simply, he whose way of life does not match his speech, and whose inner disposition is opposed to spiritual knowledge, is a thief whose appropriation of what is not his proves him to be evil. Scripture fittingly addresses these words to him: "But to the wicked God says, "Why do you speak of my statutes and appropriate my covenant with your mouth?" ' (Ps. 50:16. LXX).</p>
      <p> 66.  A man is also a thief when he conceals his soul's unseen evil behind a seemingly virtuous way of life, and disguises his inner disposition with an affected innocence. Just as one kind of thief filches his audience's mind by uttering words of wisdom, so this kind pilfers the senses of those who see him by his pretence of virtue. To him it will be said: "Be ashamed of yourselves, all you who are dressed in clothes that do not belong to you' (cf. Zeph. 1:8), and: "In that day the Lord will reveal their pretence' (Isa. 3:17. LXX). I seem to hear God saying these things to me daily in the hidden workshop of my heart, and feel that I am explicitly condemned on both counts.</p>
      <p> 67.  A man is a perjurer - that is to say, he swears falsely on the name of the Lord - when he promises God that he will lead a life of virtue and instead pursues what is alien to his promise, in this way breaking, through neglect of the commandments, the vows of his profession of the religious life. To put it briefly, he who has freely chosen to live according to God and is not perfectly dead to this</p>
      <p> [V2] 253</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> present life is a liar and a perjurer, since he has sworn an oath before God - that is, he has promised Him to follow the spiritual path irreproachably - and he has not fulfilled his promise. For this reason he merits no praise at all. For although 'everyone that swears by Him shall be praised' (Ps. 63:11. LXX), this applies only to those who, having dedicated their life to God, fulfill the vows of their promise through truly performing works of righteousness.</p>
      <p> 68.  He who simulates spiritual knowledge merely by the utterance of words filches the mind of those who hear him in order to boost his own reputation. Similarly, he who simulates virtue in his outward behavior pilfers the sight of those who look at him, once more in order to promote his own self-glory. Both steal by means of deceit, the first perverting his audience's mind, the second the bodily sense of those who see him.</p>
      <p> 69.  The person who fulfils the promises he has made merits praise because he has sworn an oath before God and has remained faithful to it; conversely, the person who breaks his promises will be impugned and dishonored because he has sworn an oath before God and has been found false.</p>
      <p> 70.  Not every man who comes into this world is necessarily enlightened by the Logos (cf John 1:9), for many remain unenlightened and have no share in the light of knowledge. But every man who comes into the real world of the virtues by his own free will, and so through a voluntary birth, is unquestionably enlightened by the Logos, receiving an immutable state of virtue and an infallible understanding of true knowledge.</p>
      <p> 71.  Not all persons and things designated in Holy Scripture by the same word are necessarily to be understood in exactly the same way. On the contrary, if we are to infer the meaning of the written text correctly, each thing mentioned must clearly be understood according to the significance that underlies its verbal form.</p>
      <p> 72.  If always understood in the same way, none of the persons, places, times, or any of the other things mentioned in Scripture, whether animate or inanimate, sensible or intelligible, will yield either the literal or spiritual sense intended. Thus he who wishes to study the divine knowledge of Scripture without floundering must respect the differences of the recorded events or sayings, and interpret each in a different way, assigning to it the appropriate spiritual sense according to the context of place and time.</p>
      <p> [V2] 254</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> 73.  Everyone should be taught to live and govern himself according to his intelligence alone, and to have so little</p>
      <p> concern for his body that he is able to break, through strenuous effort, his soul's attachment to it, and so to free his soul from all images of material things. The senses, which at first rejected the intelligence and accepted the folly of sensual pleasure, like a sinuous snake, must be quelled by the intelligence. It was because man had rejected intelligence that the sentence of death was justly imposed on him in order to put an end to the devil's access to his soul.</p>
      <p> 74.  The senses belong to a single family but are divided into five individual types. Through the apprehensive force particular to each individual type, the deluded soul is persuaded to desire the corresponding sensible objects instead of God. Hence the man of intelligence will choose to die voluntarily according to the flesh before the advent of that death which comes whether he likes it or not. and to this end he will completely sever his inner disposition from the senses.</p>
      <p> 75.  When the senses have the intellect in their clutches, they propagate polytheism through each individual sense organ; because in their slavery to the passions they pay divine honors to the sensible objects corresponding to each organ.</p>
      <p> 76.  When a man sticks to the mere letter of Scripture, his nature is governed by the senses alone, in this way proving his soul's attachment to the flesh. For if the letter is not understood in a spiritual way, its significance is restricted to the level of the senses, which do not allow its full meaning to pass over into the intellect. When the letter is appropriated by his senses alone, he receives it Judaic-wise merely in the literal sense, and so lives according to the flesh, spiritually dying each day the death of sin on account of his forceful senses: for he cannot put his body's pursuits to death by the Spirit in order to live the life of bliss in the Spirit. "For if you live according to the flesh, you will die,' says St Paul, "but if through the Spirit you put to death the body's pursuits, you will live' (Rom. 8:13).</p>
      <p> 77.  Let us not light the divine lamp - that is, the illuminating principle of knowledge - through contemplation and the practice of the virtues, and then place it under the grain bin (cf Matt. 5:15): for if we do we shall be condemned for confining the incomprehensible power of wisdom to the letter. On the contrary, let us put</p>
      <p> [V2] 255</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> it on a lampstand - the Holy Church - beaconing to all men the light of divine truth from the summit of</p>
      <p> contemplation.</p>
      <p> 78.  He who like Job and the courageous martyrs bears the assaults of unsought-for trials and temptations with an unshakeable will is a powerful lamp: for by his bravery and patience he keeps the light of salvation burning, since he possesses the Lord as his strength and his song (cf Ps. 118:14). And he who is familiar with the tricks of the devil and experienced in the close combat of the unseen warfare, is likewise illuminated by the light of spiritual knowledge and becomes another lamp, saying with St Paul, 'We are not ignorant of Satan's devices' (2 Cor. 2:11).</p>
      <p> 79.  Through fear, devotion and spiritual knowledge the Holy Spirit purifies those blessed with the purity of the virtues. Through strength, counsel and understanding He illumines those worthy of light with the knowledge of the inner and quickening essences of created beings. Through radiant, simple and complete wisdom He grants perfection to those honored with deification, leading them directly towards the Cause of created beings by every way that men can be so led. The perfect are known only by the divine qualities of goodness with which they recognize themselves in God and God in themselves, since there is no dividing wall between them. For nothing intervenes between wisdom and God. They will attain a state not subject to change or mutation, having entirely transcended all the intermediate states in which there is a danger of going astray with respect to spiritual knowledge. By these intermediate states is meant the being of the intelligible and sensible realities through which the human intellect is led on its journey to God, the Cause of all being.</p>
      <p> 80.  Practical philosophy, or the practice of the virtues, is effectuated by fear, devotion and spiritual knowledge. Natural contemplation in the Spirit is achieved through strength, counsel and understanding. Mystical theology is granted only by divine wisdom.</p>
      <p> 81.  A lamp cannot be kept burning without oil: nor can the light of spiritual gifts continue to shine unless one inwardly sustains it with actions and thoughts consonant with it. For every spiritual gift requires a corresponding inner quality in the recipient to feed it spiritually as though with oil, thus preserving its presence.</p>
      <p> 82.  Without the olive tree there can be no genuine olive oil. Without a jar to keep it in, oil cannot be kept. Unless a lamp is fed</p>
      <p> [V2] 256</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> with oil, its light will go out. Similarly, without Holy Scripture, no intellection can be truly and divinely effective. Without an inward quality or disposition capable, like ajar, of embracing it, no divine intellection can be retained. Unless the light of spiritual knowledge present in God's gifts is fed with divine intellections, it will go out.</p>
      <p> 83.  I think that the olive tree on the left side of the candlestick (cf. Zech. 4:3) signifies the Old Testament, in which the emphasis is mainly on practical philosophy; while that on the right signifies the New Testament, which teaches a new revelation and brings each believer to a state of contemplation. The first supplies the qualities of virtue, the second the principles of spiritual knowledge to those who meditate on what is divine. The first clears away the mist of visible things and raises the intellect to realities that are akin to it when it is purged of all material fantasies. The second purifies the intellect of its attachment to materiality, with resolute strength knocking out as though with a hammer the nails that rivet will and disposition to the body.</p>
      <p> 84.  The Old Testament makes the body obedient to the intelligence and raises it towards the soul by means of the virtues, preventing the intellect from being dragged down towards the body. The New Testament fires the intellect with love and unites it to God. Thus the Old Testament makes the body one in its activity with the intellect; the New Testament makes the intellect one with God through the state of grace. So close is the likeness to God which the intellect acquires, that God, who is not known as He is by nature in Himself to anyone in any way at all, is known through it just as an archetype is known from an image.</p>
      <p> 85.  Since the Old Testament is a symbol of the practice of the virtues, it brings the body's activity into harmony with that of the intellect. Since the New Testament confers contemplation and spiritual knowledge, it illumines with divine intellections and gifts of grace the intellect that cleaves to it mystically. The Old Testament supplies the man of spiritual knowledge with the qualities of virtue; the New Testament endows the man practicing the virtues with the principles of true knowledge.</p>
      <p> 86.  God may be called and actually is the Father by grace only of those whose will and disposition have been reborn in the Spirit through the practice of the virtues. By means of this birth they bear</p>
      <p> [V2] 257</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> in their soul and manifest in the virtues the imprint of God their Father. Through their way of life they make those who see them glorify God by reforming themselves, and so they provide an excellent pattern of virtue for others to</p>
      <p> imitate. For God is glorified not by mere words but by works of righteousness, which proclaim the majesty of God far more effectively than words.</p>
      <p> 87.  Because it is concerned with the senses, the natural law is represented by the olive tree on the left (cf. Zech. 4:3): it supplies the qualities of virtue to the intelligence and makes spiritual knowledge express itself in action. Because it is concerned with the intellect, the spiritual law is represented by the olive tree on the right: it imbues sense-perception with the spiritual principles of created things and makes conduct purposive and intelligent.</p>
      <p> 88.  He who embodies spiritual knowledge in his practice of the virtues and animates this practice with spiritual knowledge has found the perfect method of accomplishing the divine work. He in whom spiritual knowledge and ascetic practice are not united either makes the first an unsubstantial illusion or turns the second into a lifeless idol. For spiritual knowledge not put into practice does not differ in any way from illusion, lacking such practice to give it real substance; and practice uninformed by intelligence is like an idol, since it has no knowledge to animate it.</p>
      <p> 89.  The mystery of our salvation informs our way of life with intelligence and makes intelligence the glory of our way of life. It turns our practice of the virtues into contemplation manifest in terms of action, and our contemplation into divinely initiated practice. To put it briefly, it makes virtue the manifestation of spiritual knowledge and spiritual knowledge the sustaining power of virtue. Through both virtue and spiritual knowledge it displays a single compact wisdom. In this way we may know that by grace both Testaments agree in all things with each other, in their combination consummating a mystery more single and undivided than soul and body in a human being.</p>
      <p> 90.  Just as soul and body combine to produce a human being, so practice of the virtues and contemplation together constitute a unique spiritual wisdom, and the Old and New Testaments together form a single mystery. Goodness by nature belongs to God alone, from whom all things capable by nature of receiving light and goodness are enlightened and blessed with goodness by participation.</p>

      <p> 91.  He who uses his intellect to apprehend the visible world contemplates the intelligible world. He imbues his sense-perception with the noetic realities that he contemplates, and informs his intellect with the inner essences of what he perceives with the senses. In various ways he transfers the structure of the noetic world to the world of the senses: and conversely he transfers the complex unity of the sensible world to the intellect. He apprehends the sensible world in the noetic world, since he has transferred into the intellect the inner essences of what can be perceived by the senses; and in the sensible world he perceives the noetic world, for he has adeptly harnessed his intellect with its archetypes to his sense-perception.</p>
      <p> 92.  In the text, 'My head went down to the clefts of the mountains' (Jonah 2:6. LXX), the prophet called the first principle of unity the head, since it is the source of all virtue. The "clefts of the mountains' are the counsels of evil spirits, by which our intellect is engulfed because of the fall. The lowest depths of the earth (cf. Jonah 2:7. LXX) are that inner state which has no perception whatsoever of divine knowledge or any impetus towards the life of virtue. The abyss (cf Jonah 2:6. LXX) is the ignorance that overlays an evil disposition, like the deep waters covering the sea bed. Alternatively the abyss is the sea bed itself, signifying a firmly grounded evil disposition. The eternal bars (cf. Jonah 2:7. LXX) strengthening this abysmal state are impassioned attachments to material things.</p>
      <p> 93.  The patient endurance of the saints exhausts the evil power that attacks them, since it makes them glory in sufferings undergone for the sake of truth. It teaches those too much concerned with a life in the flesh to deepen themselves through such sufferings instead of pursuing ease and comfort: and it makes the flesh's natural weakness in the endurance of suffering a foundation for overwhelming spiritual power. For the natural weakness of the saints is precisely such a foundation, since the Lord has made their weakness stronger than the proud devil.</p>
      <p> 94.  The principle of grace has to pass through many trials in order to reach the human race - that is, the Church of the Gentiles - just as Jonah had to pass through many trials before he arrived at the great city of Nineveh. Only then does it persuade the ruling law of nature to rise from its throne - that is, to abandon its former evil</p>
      <p> [V2] 259</p>

      <p> disposition due to its involvement with the senses; to remove its robe - that is, to expunge the vanity of worldly glory from its conduct: to cover itself with sackcloth - that is, with mourning, and with the difficult rough training in hardship such as befits a life lived according to God; and to sit in ashes - symbolizing poverty of spirit, in which everyone who is learning to live a devout life sits, lashed by his conscience because of the sins he has committed (cf.</p>
      <p> Jonah 3:1-9).</p>
      <p> 95.  Observe, with reference to this passage from Jonah, how the king represents the natural law. The throne is an impassioned disposition in alliance with the senses. The robe is the display of self-esteem. Sackcloth is the grief of repentance. Ashes are humility. Men are those who sin in relation to the intelligence; beasts those who sin in relation to desire: cattle those who sin in relation to their incensive power; and sheep those who sin in relation to the contemplation of visible things.</p>
      <p> 96.  The passions of the flesh may be described as belonging to the left hand, self-conceit as belonging to the right hand (cf Jonah 4:11). Thus he who through the correct observance of virtue makes himself oblivious to the passions of the flesh, and who because of his unfaltering spiritual knowledge is not infected by the disease of self-conceit on account of his achievements, has become a man who does not know his left hand or his right hand; for he is not excited by the passions of the flesh, and he does not love transitory glory. Hence it seems likely that by the right hand Scripture means self-esteem on account of supposed achievements, and by the left hand licentiousness in shameful passions. For the principle of virtue does not know the sin of the flesh, which belongs to the left hand; and the principle of knowledge does not know the soul's evil, which belongs to the right hand.</p>
      <p> 97.   Spiritual knowledge of virtue - true and actualized knowledge of the cause of virtue - naturally produces total ignorance of the excess and deficiency which lie to the right and left of the norm of virtue. Nothing in the intelligence can be contrary to the intelligence. Thus he who has come to apprehend the principle of virtue will clearly have no way of knowing the state that is contrary to the intelligence. One cannot examine two opposites simultaneously, and know the one at the same time as the other.</p>
      <p> 98.  There is no principle of unbelief in belief, or natural cause of</p>
      <p> [V2] 260</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>

      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> darkness in light, and the devil and Christ cannot manifest themselves jointly (cf. 2 Cor. 6:14-15). In the same way, nothing unintelligent can coexist with what is in accordance with the intelligence. If it is absolutely impossible for what is contrary to the intelligence to coexist with what is in accordance with it, he who has come to apprehend the principle of virtue does not know the state that is contrary to the intelligence in any way at all; for he knows virtue only as it is, not as it is thought to be. That is why he has no knowledge either of his right hand through excess, or of</p>
      <p> his left hand through deficiency. For in both these what is contrary to the intelhgence is obviously present.</p>
      <p> 99. Unbelief means rejection of the commandments; belief is acceptance of them. Darkness is ignorance of the good; light is knowledge of it. Christ is the name given to the essence and subsistence of the good; the devil is the depraved state that produces all sins.</p>
      <p> 100.If the intelligence is a norm and measure of created beings, what falls short of that norm and measure, or alternatively what goes beyond it, is equivalent to unintelligence and so is contrary to the intelligence. Both going beyond the norm and falling short of it induce a lapse from what truly exists. The first, by making the intellect overstep its measure, produces the conviction that life's path is uncertain and ill-defined, that it does not have God as its preconceived goal, and that there is something better than what is best; the second, through slackness of the intellect, produces the conviction that the preconceived goal is confined to the sensory world, and so results in attention being given merely to the senses. Only he who unites himself to the principle of virtue, and has concentrated the whole power of his intellect in this principle, does not know and experience these things; for he cannot be affected by anything that goes beyond the intelligence or is contrary to it.</p>

      <p> 1.  Through the diligent practice of the virtues the natural mtelligence is raised towards the intellect. Through contemplation the intellect leads towards wisdom the man who aspires to spiritual knowledge. Passion, which is contrary to the intelligence, induces the man who neglects the commandments to descend to the realm of the senses, and the result of this is the intellect's attachment to sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> 2.  Virtue is a stable and utterly dispassionate state of righteousness. Nothing stands opposed to it, for it bears the stamp of God, and there is nothing contrary to that. God is the cause of the virtues; and a living knowledge of God is realized when the person who has truly recognized God changes his inner state so that it conforms more closely to the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 3.   If intelligence has determined the origin of each created being, no such being by nature either goes beyond itself or falls short of itself. Thus the norm for created things is their desire and knowledge of their Cause, and their measure is the active imitation of their Cause in so far as this is within their scope. For if created beings are carried in their desire beyond the proper norm and measure, this makes their life fruitless, since then they do not find their goal in God - and it is in God that the desire of all things finds its repose, receiving the enjoyment of</p>
      <p> Him as its self-subsistent consummation. When created beings in their desire faU short of the norm and measure, their life is again fruitless, since then they find their goal not in God but in the realm of the senses, in which there is a pleasurable but illusory enjoyment of the passions.</p>
      <p> 4.    An intellect consecrated -unconditionally to the Cause of created bemgs will be in a state of complete unknowing, since it will not contemplate any creative principle in God who, so far as all</p>
      <p> [V2] 262</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> causation is concerned. Is in essence beyond such principles. When an intellect is drawn away from all created beings towards God, it does not observe their inner principles, but only contemplates God ineffably, being with Him by grace. For the intellect that reaches up to God in ecstasy relinquishes its knowledge of the inner principles of both corporeal and incorporeal things. For nothing sequent to God can be contemplated simultaneously with God.</p>
      <p> 5.  Conceit is a truly accursed passion. It is a combination of two vices, pride and self-esteem. Pride denies the Cause of virtue and nature, while self-esteem adulterates nature and virtue itself. A proud man does nothing that accords with God's will, and a man full of self-esteem achieves nothing that accords with nature.</p>
      <p> 6.  The mark of pride is to deny that God is the author of virtue and nature: the mark of self-esteem is to make divisions in nature and so to treat some things as worthless. Conceit is their natural offspring, being an evil state composed of a voluntary denial of God and ignorance of the equal dignity that things possess by nature.</p>
      <p> 7.  Conceit is a mixture of pride and self-esteem. In its contempt for God It blasphemously maligns providence; while in its alienation from nature it treats everything belonging to nature in an unnatural way, and thus corrupts its beauty by misuse.</p>
      <p> 8.  The spirit of scorching heat (cf Jonah 4:8) signifies not only trials and temptations but also that abandonment by God which deprived the Jews of the gifts of grace. Affinity with the Spirit dissolves the soul's proclivity for the flesh, concentrates our longing on God and bmds our will to Him.</p>
      <p> what is akin to them and of the same species, since nature itself teaches men to help those in need. In addition, the natural law persuades every man to wish for everybody else whatever he considers agreeable when done to him by others. This is what the Lord teaches when He says, "Treat others as you want them to treat you" (Luke 6:31).</p>
      <p> 10. The work of the natural law is to bring into harmony all men's voluntary relationships with one another. Those whose nature is governed by the intelligence naturally share a single disposition. When men have the same disposition, their morality and living will obviously be of one kind. In such circumstances, the bond linking people together voluntarily will also be one and the</p>
      <p> [V2] 263</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> same, leading all men through-their own volition towards the single principle of nature. When that principle is realized, the divisions now prevailing in nature because of man's self-love will totally vanish. The written law, which controls the unruly impulses of the foolish by fear of punishment, accustoms them by its teaching to think specifically about giving to each other what is equitable. In this way with the passing of time the rule of justice grows ever more firmly established within them, until it becomes part of their nature. It turns fear into a disposition which is gently and gradually strengthened by a conscious desire for the good, and habit into an inner state purified by a forgetfulness of past sins and giving birth within itself to a love for others.</p>
      <p> 11.  The written law, by preventing wrongdoing through fear, accustoms one to do what is right. In time such custom produces a disposition filled with the love of righteousness, and this in turn produces a settled state of goodness, obliterating the memory of past sins.</p>
      <p> 12.  The law of grace directly teaches those who are led by it to imitate God Himself. For - if it is permitted to speak in this way - despite the fact that because of sin we were His enemies, God loved us so much more than Himself that, although He is beyond every being. He entered without changing into our being, supra-essentially took on human nature, became man and, wishing to reveal Himself as a man among men, did not refuse to make His own the penalty we pay. And as in His providence He became man, so He deified us by grace, in this way teaching us not only to cleave to one another naturally and to love others spiritually as ourselves, but also, like God, to be more concerned for others than for ourselves, and as proof of our love for each other readily to choose, as virtue enjoins, to die for others. For, as Scripture tells us, there is no greater love than to lay down one's life for a friend (cf John 11:13).</p>
      <p> 13. To recapitulate: the law of nature is a natural principle which takes control of the sense-realm in order to overcome its lack of intelligence; for lack of intelligence sunders what by nature belongs together. The written law is a natural principle which, when the lack of intelligence in the sense-realm has been overcome, acquires in addition the spiritual desire which maintains the reciprocity and interdependence of kindred beings. The law of grace is</p>
      <p> [V2] 264</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> a principle transcending nature whose purpose is our deification. It transforms nature without altering its fundamental character; and, in a manner which defies comprehension, reveals to human nature, as if in an image, the archetype that lies beyond bemg and nature and is the ground of eternal well-being.</p>
      <p> 14.  To treat one's neighbor as oneself is to be concerned simply with his existence. This pertains to the natural law. To love one's neighbor as oneself is to care, in a way that accords with virtue, for his well-being. This is prescribed by the written law (cf Lev. 19:18; Mark 12:33). To love one's neighbor more than oneself is a prerogative of the law of grace.</p>
      <p> 15.  He who curbs the impulses towards bodily pleasure learns the laws of providence, which restrain the inflammatory matter of the passions. He who accepts the whips of bodily pain is taught the laws of judgment, which cleanse him from the defilement of his earlier life through unsought sufferings.</p>
      <p> 16.  Scripture represents Jonah as grieving on account of the booth and the gourd - that is to say, on account of the flesh and the pleasure of the flesh - and it represents God as caring for Nineveh (cf. Jonah 4:1-11). From this it is clear that, compared with the things valued and prized by men, what is loved by God is better and more precious by far. For the things that men value lack being; they only seem to exist because of mistaken judgment, but have no principle of existence at all: there is only the fantasy, which cheats the intellect and through passion supplies non-existent things with empty form but no real substance.</p>
      <p> 17.  An accurate knowledge of the utterances of the Spirit is revealed only to those who are worthy of the Spirit. When through diligent cultivation of the virtues they have swept the soot of the passions from their intellect, and have made it like a pure, resplendent mirror, they receive the knowledge of divine things which, as soon as it strikes them, is imprinted upon them and given form in them as a face is reflected in a mirror. Those whose</p>
      <p> life is smutted by the passions may possibly deduce knowledge of divine things by means of plausible guesswork; but they cannot grasp or express such knowledge with any accuracy.</p>
      <p> 18. A man whose intellect has been formed by the knowledge that comes by dint of the virtues through the divme Spirit is said to experience divine things; for he has acquired such knowledge not</p>
      <p> [V2] 265</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> by nature, thanks simply to his existence, but by grace, thanks to his participation in it. When a man has not received knowledge by grace, even though he calls a particular thing spiritual, he does not know its true character from experience, for mere learning does not produce a state of spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 19.  An intellect totally purified by the virtues is automatically initiated into their inner principles, and conies to express in its own character the spiritual knowledge which is divinely stamped with their impress. For in itself every intellect is formless and without any specific quality of expression: its form is acquired, being either that of the knowledge which arises from the virtues through the Spirit, or that of ignorance, which supervenes through the passions.</p>
      <p> 20.   Everyone who has fallen away from divine love is ruled through sensual pleasure by the carnal law. With such a law, he cannot keep a single divine commandment, nor does he wish to: preferring a life of pleasure to a life ruled by virtue and lived in the Spirit of God, he embraces ignorance instead of knowledge.</p>
      <p> 21.  A person who does not penetrate with his intellect towards the divine and spiritual beauty contained within the letter of the Law develops a propensity for pleasure - that is, an attachment to the world and a love of worldly things; for his knowledge derives merely from the literal expression of the Law.</p>
      <p> 22.  The name Mephibosheth, meaning 'ignominy of mouth' (cf 2 Sam. 4:4) signifies the intellect's preoccupation with thoughts devoted to the world and to bodily indulgence. When we do not penetrate with our intellect beyond the material form exhibited in the letter of the Law, such a world-loving disposition and such preoccupation with thoughts of sensual indulgence are bound to develop in accordance with the proclivity of our will. For our intellect will be preoccupied with whatever it is we gravitate towards.</p>
      <p> 23. Or again, 'ignominy of mouth' signifies that impulsion of the inteUect which gives fonn to the passions and moulds beauty in a way that accords with sensual pleasure. For without the intellect's inventive power no passion can assume form. The name of Mephibosheth's brother Armoni, meaning "anathema' (cf. 2 Sam. 21:8), signifies the gross, ugly and shapeless impulsion of the passions;</p>
      <p> while 'ignominy of mouth' signifies that impulsion of the intellect which gives form to the passion so that it can be perceived by the</p>
      <p> [V2] 266</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> senses, and which in the shape of mental images provides the passion with suitable matter to work on.</p>
      <p> 24.  Anyone who belie\'es that the sacrifices, feasts. Sabbaths, and celebrations of the new moon specified in the Law have been instituted by God for the sake of physical license and relaxation will fall completely into the power of the passions, and will be ignominiously polluted by the shameful thoughts they stimulate. He will be in the sway of the corruptible world and preoccupied with thoughts of bodily indulgence. Dominated by the matter and form of passion, he will be unable to value anything except what is subject to decay, senses, and which in the shape of mental images provides the passion with suitable matter to work on.</p>
      <p> 25.  He who persuades himself that physical self-indulgence is commanded by God in the Law gleefully accepts gluttony as a gift from God. In this spirit he develops forms of behavior which pollute the senses through misuse, senses, and which in the shape of mental images provides the passion with suitable matter to work on.</p>
      <p> 26.  When the soul's contemplative faculty embraces self-indulgence as a divine command, it makes an unnatural use of the senses, not allowing them to express themselves at all in accordance with nature. In these circumstances the soul's contemplative faculty begets an implicit or else an active state of passion, and accepts gluttony as a divine prescription, thus developing forms of behavior that defile the senses by misuse and destroy the natural principles and seeds in created beings.</p>
      <p> 27.  Nobody can embrace the least natural principle or thought if he devotes himself merely to a literal observance of the Law, since symbols and nature are not identical. Because of the difference between symbols and Ac</p>
      <p> nature of created beings, a person who stops short at the symbols of the Law is incapable of a noetic vision of the nature of created beings and cannot encompass the inner essences implanted in them by their Creator.</p>
      <p> 28. He whose God is his belly and who prides himself on his ignominy as if it were something splendid (cf Phil. 3:19) is merely cleaving to the shameful passions as if they were divine. Because of this he pursues only what is temporal, that is to say, matter and form and the perverted impulses of the five senses. When the senses combine with matter and form they produce passion, killing and effacing natural principles. For, in accordance with the principle of being, passion and nature in no way coexist with each other: the principle of nature is never naturally conjoined with passion, and passion is never co-engendered with nature.</p>
      <p> [V2] 267</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> 25. He who does not believe that the scriptures are spiritual is unaware of his lack of spiritual knowledge, yet wastes away with hunger. Strictly speaking, however, hunger is a deprivation of blessings that we already know by experience and a total absence and dearth of the spiritual nourishment that sustains the soul. How, then, can one regard as hunger or loss one's complete destitution with regard to what one has never once known in any way at aU?</p>
      <p> 30. The truly hungry are the faithful who have already acquired knowledge of the truth. So, too, is the soul of every man who has abandoned the grace of spiritual contemplation and become a slave to the literal and external forms of religion; for he does not nourish his intellect with the splendor of his intellections, but imbues his perception with impassioned fantasies derived from the material aspects of scriptural symbols.</p>
      <p> 31. Everyone who does not apply himself to the spiritual con-templation of Holy Scripture has, Judaic-wise, also rejected both the natural and the written law; and he is ignorant of the law of grace which confers deification on those who are obedient to it. He who understands the written law in a literal manner does not nourish his soul with the virtues. He who does not grasp the inner principles of created beings fails to feast his intellect on the manifold wisdom of God. And he who is ignorant of the great mystery of the new grace does not rejoice in the hope of future deification. Thus failure to contemplate the written law spiritually results in a dearth of the divine wisdom to be apprehended in the natural law; and this in its turn is followed by a complete ignorance of the deification given by grace according to the new mystery.</p>
      <p> 32. Every intellect endowed by the grace of Christ with discriminative and penetrating vision, always desires said seeks the face of the Lord. The face of the Lord is true contemplation and Spiritual knowledge of divine things attained through virtue. When one seeks this contemplation and knowledge one learns the cause of one's destitution and dearth. For just as the face is the distinctive feature of each person, so spiritual knowledge Is th6 special characteristic of what is divine. He who seeks such knowledge is said to seek the face of the Lord. But the person who has become carnal through bloody sacrifices performed in accordance with the letter of the Law possesses the ignorance which he desires: for he accepts commandments</p>
      <p> [V2] 268</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> only for the pleasure they give to the flesh and he confines his perception literally to the material sense of the written word.</p>
      <p> 33.  In the case of the person who confines himself to a literal observance of the Law, the matter which, he engenders is the act of sin that he commits:, while the form that he devises in a materialistic fashion is the intellect's assent to the sensual pleasures that attract him to the act of sin. He who understands Scripture in a spiritual way puts to death both the act of sin, which corresponds to matter, and the assent to it, which corresponds to form: and he also puts to death the misuse of the senses for the sake of pleasure. He does this by means of thoughts that by nature pertain to higher levels of contemplation.</p>
      <p> 34.   Once the external observance of the letter of the Law has been superseded, together with the ignorance that goes with it, it is then possible to put an end to the matter and form of which we have been speaking, as well as to the five ways of misusing the five senses with regard to matter and form - and by this I mean the impassioned and unnatural association of the senses with sensible things subject to time and change. The spiritual law, or mtellect, destroys this association by means of the higher principles and thoughts which are found in natural contemplation. In this way the intellect, when it has attained the heights of the law of spiritual contemplation, destroys man's all-pervasive subjection, established through the symbols of temporal things, to sense-perception and to the outward form of things.</p>
      <p> is expressed and the divine realities which these symbols represent. Further, if through such contemplation a man has not first discerned this disparity and, denying his sense-perception all access to the hidden realm of divine and intelligible realities, does not long to penetrate with his intellect into its beauty, he cannot be liberated completely from the external diversity to be found in the symbols. So long as he cleaves to the letter, his inner hunger for spiritual knowledge will not be satisfied; for he has condemned himself like the wily serpent to feed on the earth - that is. on the outward or literal form - of Scripture (cf Gen. 3:14), and does not, as a true disciple of Christ, feed on heaven - that is, on the spirit and soul of Scripture, in other words, on celestial and angelic bread. I mean that he does</p>
      <p> [V2] 269</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> not feed through Christ on the spiritual contemplation and knowledge of the Scriptures, which God gives unstintingly to those who love Him, in accordance with the text: 'He gave them the bread of heaven: man ate the food of angels' (Ps. 78:24-25. LXX).</p>
      <p> 36.   Interpretation of the outward form of Scripture according to the norms of: sense-perception must be superseded, for it clearly promotes the passions as well as proclivity towards what is temporal and transient. That is to say, we must destroy the impassioned activity of the senses with regard to sensible objects, as if destroying the children and grandchildren of Saul (cf 2 Sam. 21:1-9); and we must do this by ascending to the heights of natural contemplation through a mystical interpretation of divine utterances, if in any way we desire to be filled with divine grace.</p>
      <p> 37.  When the Law is understood only according to the letter, it is hostile to the truth, as the Jews were, and as is anyone else who possesses their mentality. For such a person limits the Law's power merely to the letter, and does not advance to natural contemplation, which reveals the spiritual knowledge hidden mystically in the letter; for this contemplation mediates between figurative representations of the truth and the truth itself, and leads its adepts away from the first and towards the second. On the contrary, he rejects natural contemplation altogether and so excludes himself from initiation into divine realities. Those who diligently aspire to a vision of these realities must therefore destroy the outward and, evanescent interpretation of the Law, Subject to time and change; and they must do this by means of natural contemplation, having ascended to the heights of spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> contemplation he destroys his soul's pleasure-provoked and body-indulging subjection - promoted by the written Law - to the restless and evanescent world of materiality. In this way he slays, as though it were Saul's children and grandchildren, his earth-bound understanding of the Law. At the same time, through this natural, contemplation on the heights of spiritual knowledge, he openly confesses his error of previously interpreting the Law according to its outward form. For the text, 'to hang them before the Lord' (cf 2 Sam. 21:9), may be understood to mean this: to bring into the light by means of spiritual knowledge his preoccupation with the letter of the Law</p>
      <p> [V2] 270</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> and the prejudice from which he suffers as a result. This is to show that, thanks to contemplation, the letter of the Law  has  been killed by spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 39. 'The letter kills." says Scripture, 'but the Spirit gives life' (2 Cor. 3:6). Consequently, the letter whose nature it is to kill must be killed by the life-giving Spirit. For what is material in the Law and what is divine - namely, the letter and the Spirit - cannot coexist, nor can what destroys life be reconciled with that which by nature bestows life.</p>
      <p> 40.  The Spirit bestows life, the letter destroys it. Thus the letter cannot function at the same time as the Spirit, just as what gives life cannot coexist with what destroys life and the prejudice from which he suffers as a result. This is to show that, thanks to contemplation, the letter of the Law has been killed by spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 41.   Circumcision, in its mystical sense, is the complete cutting away of the intellect's impassioned attachment to all that comes into being in a contingent manner. Viewing things on the natural level, we recognize that the removal of an attribute naturally bestowed by God does not produce perfection. For nature does not bring about perfection when it is mutilated by human ingenuity, or when through over-subtlety men deprive it of something conferred on it by God at creation. Otherwise we would be attributing to human ingenuity more power to establish a perfect order of things than to God, and to an ingenious mutilation of nature the ability to make good shortcomings in God's creation. But if we understand circumcision figuratively, we learn that we are spiritually to circumcise the impassioned disposition of our soul. In this way our will, having freed the intellect from its impassioned subjection to the law that rules the birth of contingent things, is brought into harmony with nature.</p>
      <p> 42. Uncircumcision is natural. Everything that is natural is the work of divine creation and is excellent: 'And God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good" (Gen. 1:31). But the Law, by demanding on the grounds of uncleanness that the foreskin should be cutaway by circumcision (cf. Gen. 17:10-14), presents God as amending His own work through human skill. This is a most blasphemous way of looking at things. He, then, who interprets the symbols whereby the Law is expressed in the light of knowledge attained through natural contemplation, knows that God does not set nature aright by means of human skill, but bids us circumcise the passible aspect of the soul so as to make it obedient to</p>
      <p> [V2] 271</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> the mtelligence. This is indicated figuratively in terms of the body, and means that we are to excise the flaws from our will by means of spiritual knowledge acquired through the courageous practice of the virtues. The circumcismg priest signifies spiritual knowledge, and the knife he uses is the courageous practice of the virtues, which cuts away the passions. When the. Spirit triumphs over the letter, the tradition of the Law is abolished.</p>
      <p> 43. The Sabbath (cf. Exod. 16:23; 20:10) signifies rest from the passions, and from the intellect's gravitation towards the nature of created beings. It signifies the total quiescence of the passions, a complete cessation of the intellect's gravitation towards created things, and its total entry into the divine. He who has attained this state -so far as God permits - by means of virtue and spiritual knowledge, must not ponder on any material thing at all for, like sticks (cf. Num. 15:32), such things excite the passions; and he must not call to mind any natural principle whatsoever. Otherwise, like the pagans, we will be affirming that God delights in the passions or is commensurate with nature. Perfect silence alone proclaims Him, and total and transcendent unknowing brings us into His presence.</p>
      <p> 44.   A crown of goodness (cf. Ps. 65:11) is a pure faith, adorned with eloquent doctrine, and with spiritual principles and intellections, as if with precious stones, and set as it were on the head of the devout intellect. Or rather, a crown of goodness is the Logos of God Himself, who encircles the intellect as if it were a head, protecting it with manifold forms of providence and judgment - that is, with mastery of the passions that lie within our control and with patient endurance of those we suffer against our will; and who makes this same intellect more beautiful by enabling it to participate in the grace of deification.</p>
      <p> passions which he within the control of the will. It is also said that patient endurance is a work of God's judgment, because it enables us to resist those trials we suffer against our will. Moreover, being a token of practical philosophy, such endurance brings those who have been enslaved in an Egypt of sin across to the realm of virtue.</p>
      <p> 46.  God did not order the Sabbath, the new moons and the feasts to be honored because He wanted men to honor the days</p>
      <p> [V2] 272</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> themselves: this would have been tantamount to decreeing by the Law that men should worship creation rather than the Creator (cf Rom. 1:25), and should regard the days as holy in themselves and therefore to be venerated. On the contrary. He indicated that He Himself was to be honored symbolically through the days. For He is the Sabbath, as the soul's repose after its exertions in the flesh, and as the cessation of its sufferings in the cause of righteousness. He is the Passover, as the liberator of those held in the bitter slavery of sin. He is the Pentecost, as the origin and consummation of all created beings, and as the principle through which all things by nature exist. Thus the Law destroys those who apprehend it in a literal or outward way, leading them to worship creation rather than the Creator, and to regard as holy in themselves things that were brought into existence for man's sake; for they remain ignorant of Him on whose account they were created.</p>
      <p> 47. The world is a finite place and possesses but limited stability. Time is circumscribed movement. It follows that the movement of living things within time is subject to change. When nature passes beyond place and time, actively "and inwardly - that is, when it passes beyond those things which always accompany created being, namely, a limited state of stability and limited movement - it is united directly with pro\'idence, and finds in providence a principle which is by nature simple, stable, without limitation and thus completely without movement.</p>
      <p> 48. Since nature exists in the world in a temporal mode, its movement is subject to change because of the world's limited stability and its liability to alteration and corruption through the passing of time. When nature has come to exist in God through the essential unity of Him m whom it was created, it will possess an ever-moving stability and a stable and changeless form of movement generated eternally round that which is one, unique and always the same. It has been said that this state is a direct and permanent grounding in the first cause of created</p>
      <p> beings.</p>
      <p> 49. The mystery of Pentecost is the direct union with providence of those things that are in its care. It is the union of nature with its principle, the Logos, under the guidance of providence: and in this union there is not the slightest trace of time or generation. Again,</p>

      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> the Logos is our trumpet (ct. Lev. 23:24), summoning us with divine and hidden knowledge. He is our propitiation (cf. Lev. 25: 9) since He expiates our offenses in His own person by becoming like us, and divinizes our sinful nature by the gift: of grace through the Spirit. He is our booth or tabernacle (cf. Lev. 23:42), since He is the realization of that immutability with which our inner being, conformed to God, is concentrated on the divine, and also the securing bond of our transformation into an immortal state.</p>
      <p> 50.  If God rejoiced simply in bloody sacrifices, this would imply that He is governed by passion and wishes those who offer sacrifice to Him to value the passions; for the sincere worshipper gladly rejoices in the same things as does the God whom he worships. But the sacrifices of which Scripture speaks are rather the slaughter of the passions and the offering up of our natural powers. Of these powers, the ram typifies the intelligence (cf. Lev. 23:42), the bull the mcensive power (cf. Exod. 29:36), and the goat represents desire (cf Num. 15:27).</p>
      <p> 51.  By spiritual sacrifices is meant not only the putting to death of the passions, slaughtered by 'the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God' (Eph. 6:17), and the deliberate emptying out of all life in the flesh, as if it were blood; the term also signifies the offering up of the moral state we have gained through the practice of the virtues, together with all our natural powers, which we dedicate and offer to God as whole burnt sacrifices, to be consumed by the fire of grace in the Spirit, so that they are filled with divine power.</p>
      <p> 52.  When a materialistic understanding of Scripture dominates the soul, it leads the soul to reject natural principles by misusing its natural powers: and so long as this understanding retains its hold it expels, pursues and destroys all such principles and droughts. For it limits the Law to the flesh alone, and honors the shameful passions as divine. But natural thoughts, made fearless through the law of the Spirit, kill the passions at a stroke.</p>
      <p> He worships God actively in the new way of the Spirit through the higher forms of contemplation, and not in the old way of the written, code (cf Rom. 7:6), which makes man interpret the Law in an outward and sensual manner and, Judaic-like, fosters the passions and encourages sm.</p>

      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> 54.  As soon as a person stops interpreting Scripture in an outward and sensual manner, his intellect reverts to its natural spiritual state: he accomplishes spiritedly what the Jews performed in a purely external and physical manner, thereby provoking God's anger.</p>
      <p> 55.  Every intellect caught up by God cuts off simultaneously both the energy of the passions and the uncouth jostle of thoughts. In addition to this it also puts an end to the licentious misuse of the senses. For the passions, brought triumphantly into subjection by the higher forms of contemplation, are destroyed by the sublime vision of nature.</p>
      <p> 56.  The power of sin - or in other words, the will of the flesh - is destroyed by the grace of holy baptism, and by active obedience to God's commandments. Such obedience destroys the power of sin with the sword of the Spirit (cf. Eph. 6:17), that is, with the revelation of divine knowledge in the Spirit; for obedience secretly cries to the passion of sin as Samuel cried to Agag: 'As your sword has made women childless, so today shall your mother be childless among women" (1 Sam. 15:33).</p>
      <p> 57.  Using the mellow thought of pleasure as if it were a sword, the passion of gluttony makes many virtues childless. By means of dissipation it kills the seeds of self-restraint; through greed it corrupts the equity of justice; with self-love it severs the natural bond of compassion, m short, the passion of gluttony destroys all virtue's offspring.</p>
      <p> 58.   The passion of gluttony kills all the divine offspring of the virtues. But that passion itself is killed through the spiritual knowledge acquired by the grace of faith and by obedience to the divine commandments.</p>
      <p> 59.   Our Lord is truly a light to the Gentiles (cf. Isa. 49:6; Luke 2:32): through true knowledge He opens the eyes of their mind, closed as they have been by the darkness of ignorance. Moreover, through His divine conduct He has made Himself a noble example of virtue to the faithful, becoming their model and pattern. Looking to Him</p>
      <p> as the author of our salvation, we attain the virtues by imitating Him in our own conduct, so far as this is possible for us.</p>
      <p> 60.  Anyone who hates a man through envy, and maliciously slanders him because he is stronger in the struggle for virtue and richer in spiritual knowledge, is choked like Saul by an evil spirit.</p>
      <p> [V2] 275</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> (cf 1 Sam. 16:14): he cannot bear to see someone better than himself enjoying the glory that comes through virtue and spiritual knowledge. And he rages all the more because he cannot actually kill this good man (cf 1 Sam, 18:10-11). In addition, he often bitterly banishes the beloved Jonathan from his presence (cf. 1 Sam. 19:4-5; 20: 30-32) -that is, he suppresses the innate judgment of his conscience, which rebukes his unjust hatred and from a love of truth recounts the achievements of the man whom he hates.</p>
      <p> 61.   Let us, too, beseech the noetic David to make our intellect, frenzied by material things, resonant with the lyre of spiritual contemplation and knowledge, and to drive out the evil spirit of material inconstancy that dominates the world of the senses (cf. 1 Sam. 16:23). In this way we may be able to understand the Law spiritually and find the divine principle hidden mystically within it, so that it becomes for us a lasting source of eternal life.</p>
      <p> 62.   Every lover of salvation is totally committed either to the practice of the virtues or to the contemplative life. For without virtue and spiritual knowledge no one can attain salvation in any way whatsoever. For virtue controls the body's impulses, skillfully curbing with sound thoughts its gravitation towards unnatural conduct; while by means of contemplation one inwardly lays hold of what has been rightly conceived and intelligently assessed.</p>
      <p> 63.  Since apprehension is intellective, and what is apprehended is intelligible, what is apprehended is, so to speak, the nourishment and substance of that which apprehends. Thus when God is apprehended by incorporeal beings - who are themselves intellects - and becomes intelligible to them to the degree to which they come into communion with Him, He illumines them from within, their intellects both apprehending Him and being nourished by Him.</p>
      <p> 64.   The intelligible is one thing and the intellective is another, the first in some sense, as we have already indicated, nourishing the second. For what is apprehended - the intelligible - is superior and conceptually prior to that</p>
      <p> which apprehends, which is intellective. Beings that apprehend such superior intelligibles with the intellect are intellective. What is apprehended is intelligible, and it is this that nourishes the intellective - or, in other words, nourishes that which apprehends.</p>
      <p> 65.  An effect enshrines, as far as possible, the image of its cause. All created things are effects, while what has brought them into</p>
      <p> [V2] 276</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> bemg is their cause. But there is no exact resemblance between cause and effect.</p>
      <p> 66.  Although effects enshrine, so far as possible, the images of their causes, there is no exact resemblance between the two, since causes surpass and transcend effects with regard to their mode of origin. For what pertains: to effects pre-exists superlatively and essentially in their causes.</p>
      <p> 67.  Effects comprise all created things in heaven and on earth, while the causes that have brought them into being are the three Persons of the Holy Trinity. It is therefore clear that there can be no exact resemblance between the two.</p>
      <p> 68.  Our intellect possesses the power of apprehension through which it perceives intelligible realities: it also possesses the capacity for a union that transcends its nature and that unites it with what is beyond its natural scope. It is through this union that divine realities are apprehended, not by means of our own natural capacities, but by virtue of the fact that we entirely transcend ourselves and belong entirely to God. It is better to belong to God than to ourselves: for it is on those who belong to God that divine gifts are bestowed.</p>
      <p> 69.   When the intellect wants to apprehend something, it descends from its own level to the level of intellection. For intellections are inferior to the subject that apprehends, since they are the means through which apprehension and understanding take place: and they disperse and divide the intellect's unity. The intellect is simple and integral, while intellections are multiple and dispersive: they are, so to speak, the forms of the intellect. For this reason intellective subjects - beings endowed with intellect - are inferior to intelligible realities that are the objects of apprehension. It is by virtue of its unity that the intellect reaches out to what is beyond its natural scope and attains the contemplation of God. This it does by transcending all that belongs to the sensible and</p>
      <p> intelligible worlds, and even its own activity; for only thus may it receive the ray of divine knowledge.</p>
      <p> 70. An intellective being that acts intellectively in accordance with its own principle naturally apprehends with its intellect. Moreover it will love what it apprehends and so in a passive manner, under the influence of the erotic impulse, it will be drawn out of</p>
      <p> [V2] 277</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> itself towards that which it loves; and this impulse will grow continually more urgent and intense. In this way it will not rest until it is entirely immersed in the total reality of what it loves, wholly and willingly encompassed by the wholeness of that reality, welcoming its saving embrace, and completely conformed to that which embraces it. So much will this be the case that it will now wish to be recognized not from itself but; from what embraces it, like air made  luminous by  light  or iron penetrated through  and through by  fire,  or  something else of this kind.</p>
      <p> 71.   The relationship between the intellective faculty and intelligible realities, and between the sensory faculties and sensible realities, is in each case extremely close. Since man is constituted of soul and sentient body, he is limited and defined and he himself imposes limits and makes definitions by virtue of the natural and distinctive reciprocity that exists between himself and these two aspects of creation. As a compound of soul and body he is limited essentially by intelligible and sensible realities, while at the same time he himself defines these realities through his capacity to apprehend intellectually and to perceive with his senses. God, on the other hand, exists simply and without limitation beyond all created realities, whether comprehending or comprehended, for He has absolutely no relationship with anything at all.</p>
      <p> 72.  Every forbidden sensual pleasure comes into being as a result of passion and through the perception of some sensible object. For sensual pleasure is nothing other than the form of sensation created in the sentient faculty by some sensible object, or else the mode of sensitive activity when this is set in motion by desire that is contrary to the intelligence. For when desire combines with the senses, it is changed into pleasure, itself contriving .the form the pleasure takes. And when the senses are stimulated' by desire, they produce pleasure, taking advantage of the sensible object The saints recognize that the soul assumes an earthly form when, contrary to nature, it is impelled towards material things by means of the flesh; consequently they resolve to redirect their impulses in accordance with nature towards God by means of the soul, and to adapt their flesh to Him, adorning it as far as possible with images of the divine through the practice of the virtues.</p>
      <p> 73.  The saints in their nobility pass through this present age of trials by acting unfailingly in accordance with nature. Once their</p>
      <p> [V2] 278</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> intellect has grasped the simple essences of created things, they unite their senses to it by means of the intelligence; then when the intellect has been completely liberated from all nnpulsion toward created things, and is at rest even with its own natural activity, they offer it to God. Wholly united with God in this way, they are totally immingled through the spirit with the whole God, since they have put on the whole image of the heavenly (cf. 1 Cor. 15:49) - so far as human beings can do this - and have consecrated themselves to God, drawing the divine image to themselves, if it be permitted to speak thus, as much as being drawn by it.</p>
      <p> 74.  We are told that God and man are exemplars of each other. Man's ability to deify himself through love for God's sake is correlative with God's becoming man through compassion for man's sake. And man's manifestation through the virtues of the God who is by nature invisible is correlative with the degree to which his intellect is seized by God and imbued with spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 75.  The person who has mortified the earthly aspects of himself (cf Col. 3:5), thoroughly extinguishing the will of the flesh within him and repudiating the attachment to it which splits asunder the love we owe to God alone; who has disowned all the modalities of the flesh and the world for the sake of divine grace, so as to be able to say with Paul the apostle, 'What can separate us from the love of Christ?" (Rom. 8:35) - such a person has become, like Melchisedec, 'without father, without mother, without descent' (Heb. 7:3). For, because of the union with the Spirit that has taken place withm him, he cannot now be dominated by flesh or by nature.</p>
      <p> 76.  I do not think that the end of this present life is rightly called death. More accurately, it is deliverance from death, separation from corruption, liberation from slavery. Cessation of turbulence, destruction of wars, dispelling of darkness, rest from suffering, calming of turmoil, eclipsing of shame, escape from passions and, to sum up, the termination of all evils. The saints who have achieved these things through voluntary mortification live as strangers and pilgrims in this life (cf Heb. 11:13), fighting bravely against the world and the body and the assaults stemming from them. And, having stifled the deceit which both of these engender because of the</p>
      <p> close connection existing between the senses and sensible objects, they keep the dignity  of their soul unenslaved.</p>
      <p> 77. Nature itself gives no small token of the knowledge of</p>
      <p> [V2] 279</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> providence planted naturally within us whenever it urges us instinctively towards God through prayer in times of sudden crisis, and makes us seek salvation from Him. For when we are suddenly overtaken by violent events, before thinking of anything else we involuntarily call upon God. It is as if providence itself, without any conscious thought on our part, were drawing us to itself, outstripping the speed of our noetic faculty and showing us that divine help is stronger than anything else. Nature would not lead us purposelessly to what does not naturally exist. It is clear to everyone that whatever is a natural consequence of something demonstrates its own authenticity with the force of truth.</p>
      <p> 78.   Some things are good and others are bad, and these belong either to the present or to the future. A good which is expected in the future is called desire, and one which is possessed in the present is called pleasure. Conversely, an evil which is expected in the future is called fear, and one which is experienced in the present is called distress. Consequently, with regard to good things, whether really good or only thought to be so, pleasure and desire both exist and are to be observed; and the same may be said of distress and fear where evil things are concerned. Desire when fulfilled produces pleasure, and when frustrated results in distress.</p>
      <p> 79.  It is said that distress is of its very nature evil. For although a man engaged in the practice of the virtues grieves over the evils that befall others, he is compassionate not primarily by deliberate choice but as a consequence of whatever misfortune it is that occurs. A contemplative, on the other hand, remains dispassionate in the face of such evils, since he has united himself with God and is detached from all that happens in this present life.</p>
      <p> 80.   Since all the saints have truly grasped the divine and infallible Logos, they pass through this present age without printing their soul's footsteps on any of the delights which are to be found in it. For they have rightly made their intellect receptive to the loftiest principles concerning God accessible to man, the principles of goodness and</p>
      <p> love. They have learnt that God, moved by these principles, has endowed created things with being and granted them well-being as a gift of grace. Yet perhaps when referring to God, who alone is unmoved, we should speak not of movement but of will; for it is God's will that moves all things, brings all things into existence, sustains them, yet is never moved in any way whatsoever.</p>
      <p> [V2] 280</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> 81. Smce the soul is an intellective and intelligent substance, it both apprehends with its intellect and uses its intelligence. The intellect is its potentiality, the act of intellection its dynamic, and the intellectual concept or conceptual image its actualization. For the intellectual concept marks the completion of the act of intellection as regards both the intellective subject and the object intellectually apprehended: it intervenes between the two and determines their relation to each other. For when' the soul apprehends, its act of intellection stops once the object of that act has been grasped: what has truly been apprehended once and for all no longer calls forth the potentiality of the soul to apprehend it. In this way the formation of an intellectual concept brings the act of intellection to an end.</p>
      <p> 82.  Just as ignorance divides those who are deluded, so the presence of spiritual light draws together and unites those whom it enlightens. It makes them perfect and brings them back to what really exists; converting them from a multiplicity of opinions it unites their varied points of view - or, more accurately, their fantasies - into one simple, true and pure spiritual knowledge, and fills them with a single unifying light.</p>
      <p> 83.  The beautiful is identical with the good, for all things seek the beautiful and good at every opportunity, and there is no being which does not participate in them. They extend to all that is, being what is truly admirable, sought for, desired, pleasing, chosen and loved. Observe how the divine force of love - the erotic power preexisting in the good - has given birth to the same blessed force within us, through which we long for the beautiful and good in accordance with the words, "I became a lover of her beauty' (Wisd. 8:2), and 'Love her and she will sustain you; fortify her and she will exalt you' (Prov. 4: 6, 8).</p>
      <p> 84.  Theologians call the divine sometimes an erotic force, sometimes love, sometimes that which is intensely longed for and loved. Consequently, as an erotic force and as love, the divine itself is subject to movement; and as that which is intensely longed for and loved it moves towards itself everything that is receptive of this force and love. To express this more clearly; the divine itself is subject to movement since it produces an inward state of intense</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> longing and love in those receptive to them; and it moves others since by nature it attracts the desire of those who are drawn: to-wards it. In other words, it moves others and itself moves since it thirsts to be thirsted for, longs to be longed for, and loves to be loved.</p>
      <p> 85.  The divine erotic force also produces ecstasy, compelling those who love to belong not to themselves but to those whom they love. This is shown by superior beings through their care of inferiors, by those of equal dignity through their mutual union, and by lower beings through their divine conversion towards those that are highest in rank. It was in consequence of this that St Paul, possessed as he was by this divine erotic force and partaking of its ecstatic power, was inspired to say: "1 no longer live, but Christ lives in me" (Gal. 2:20). He uttered these words as a true lover and, as he himself says, as one who has gone out from himself to God (cf 2 Cor. 5:13), not living his own life but that of the beloved, because of his fervent love for Him.</p>
      <p> 86.  One must also in the name of truth be bold enough to affirm that the Cause of all things, through the beauty, goodness and profusion of His intense love for everything, goes out of Himself in His providential care for the whole of creation. By means of the supra-essential power of ecstasy, and spell-bound as it were by goodness, love and longing. He relinquishes His utter transcendence in order to dwell in all things while yet remaining-within Himself Hence those skilled in divine matters call Him a zealous and exemplary lover, because of the intensity of His blessed longing for all things and because He rouses others to imitate His own intense desire, revealing Himself as their exemplar; for in Him what is desirable is worthy of emulation, and He deserves to be imitated by the beings under His care.</p>
      <p> 87.  God is said to be the originator and begetter of love and the erotic force. For He externalized them from within Himself, that is. He brought them forth into the world of created things. This is why Scripture says that "God is love' (1 John 4:16), and elsewhere that He is 'sweetness and desire" (cf. Song of Songs 5:16. LXX), which signifies the erotic force. For what is worthy of love and truly desirable is God Himself. Because loving desire is poured out from Him, He Himself, as its begetter, is said to be in movement, while because He is what is truly longed for, loved, desired and chosen.</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> He stirs into motion the things that turn towards Him, and which possess the power of desiring each in the degree appropriate it.</p>
      <p> You should understand that God stimulates and allures in order to bring about an erotic union in the Spirit; that is to say. He is the go-between in this union, the one who brings the parties together, in order that He may be desired and loved by His creatures. God stimulates in that He impels each being, in accordance with its own principle, to return to Him. Even though the word "allurement' signifies something impure to the profane, here it stands for the mediation which effects the union with God.</p>
      <p> 89.  The erotic impulsion of the Good, that pre-exists in the Good, is simple and self-moving; it proceeds from the Good, and returns again to the Good, since it is without end or beginning. This is why we always desire the divine and union with the divine. For loving union with God surpasses and excels all other unions.</p>
      <p> 90.  We should regard the erotic force, whether divine, angelic, noetic, psychic or physical, as a unifymg and comminglmg power. It impels superior bemgs to care for .those below them, beings of equal dignity to act with reciprocity, and, finally, inferior beings, to return to those that are greater and more excellent than they.</p>
      <p> 91.   Spiritual knowledge unites knower and known, while ignorance is always a cause of change and self-division in the ignorant. Hence nothing, according to sacred Scripture, will shift him who truly believes from the ground of his true faith, in which resides the permanence of his immutable and unchanging identity. For he who has been united with the truth has the assurance that all is well with him, even though most people rebuke him for being out of his mind. For without their being aware he has moved from delusion to the truth of real faith; and he knows for sure that he is not deranged, as they say, but that through truth - simple and always immutably the same - he has been liberated from the fluctuating and fickle turmoil of the manifold forms of illusion.</p>
      <p> 92.  The saints are full of goodness, compassion, kindliness and mercy. They manifest the same love for the whole human race. Because of this they hold fast throughout their lives to the highest of all blessings, humility, that conserves, other blessings and destroys their opposites. Thus they become totally immune to vexing trials and temptations, whether those due to ourselves and subject to our</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> Various Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and Vice</p>
      <p> Fifth Century</p>
      <p> volition, or net from ourselves and beyond our control. They wither the attacks of the first type through self-control, and repel the assaults of the second type with patient endurance.</p>
      <p> 93.  The perfect practice of virtue is produced by true faith and genuine fear of God. Unerring natural contemplation - in the course of the spiritual ascent is produced by a sure hope and a sound understanding. Deification through assumption into the divine is produced by perfect love and an intellect voluntarily blinded, because of its transcendent state, to created things.</p>
      <p> 94.  The function of practical philosophy is to purify the intellect of every impassioned fantasy. The function of natural contemplation is to initiate the intellect into the true knowledge that is found in created things and according to which they possess existence. The function of mystical theology is by grace to make the intellect like God and equal to Him - as far as this is possible - so that it becomes totally unaware, because of its transcendent state, of anything that is sequent to God.</p>
      <p> 95.  Ether, or the fiery element, in the world of the senses corresponds in the world of the mind to understanding - a state that illumines and manifests the spiritual principles particular to each created being, revealing through these principles tike Cause that is present in them all, and drawing out the soul's desire for the divine. Air in the world of the senses corresponds in the world of the mind to courage - a state that quickens, sustains and activates this innate life of the spirit, and invigorates the soul's ceaseless aspiration for the divine. Water in the world of the senses corresponds in the world of the mind to self-restraint - a state that produces a vitalizing fecundity in the spirit and generates an ever-resurgent erotic enchantment attracting the soul to the divine. Earth in the world of the senses corresponds in the world of the mind to justice - a state that begets all the inner principles of created things according to their kind, that in spirit shares out the gifts of life to each thing m an equitable way, and that is by its own free choice rooted and established immovably in beauty and goodness.</p>
      <p> 96.  When the flesh flourishes and burgeons, the soul is afflicted and darkened by the passions, because the state of virtue and the illumination of spiritual knowledge withdraw. Conversely, when the soul is fortified and made resplendent with the divine beauty of the virtues and with the illumination of spiritual knowledge, the</p>

      <p> outer man is weakened, because the flesh loses its natural vigor through the indwelling of the Logos.</p>
      <p> 97.  Created man cannot become a son of God and god by grace through deification, unless he is first through his own free choice begotten m the Spirit by means of the self-loving and independent power dwelling naturally within him. T'he first man neglected this divinizing, divine and immaterial birth by choosing what is manifest and delectable to the senses in preference to the spiritual blessings that were as yet unrevealed. In this way he fittingly condemned himself to a bodily generation that is without choice, material and subject to death.</p>
      <p> 98.  In his present state man acts either to satisfy the uncontrolled fantasies of passions deceitfully provoked for the sake of self-indulgence, or to perform work forced on him by some necessity, or in order to discover the natural laws of nature. In the beginning none of these things constrained man in this way, for he was above all things. That indeed is how it was right for the first man to be: not in the least distracted by anything below him, or around him, or over against him, and requiring only one thing for his perfection - an indomitable striving, backed by all the strength of his love, towards the God above him.</p>
      <p> 99.   Nothing that had to be learnt interposed itself between God and the first man, impeding the free relationship that was to be sealed by love through his striving towards God. Being dispassionate by grace, he was not subject to the delusory fantasies of passions provoked by the desire for sensual pleasure. Being self-sufficient, he was free from needs forcing him to engage in some kind of work. Being wise, he possessed a spiritual knowledge that made him superior to the study of nature.</p>
      <p> 100.   God, who created all nature with wisdom and secretly planted in each intelligent being knowledge of Himself as its first power, like a munificent Lord gave also to us men a natural desire and longing for Him, combining it in a natural way with the power of our intelligence. Using our intelligence, we struggle so as to learn with tranquility and without going astray how to realize this natural desire. Impelled by it we are led to search out the truth, wisdom and order manifest harmoniously in all creation, aspiring through them to attain Him by whose grace we received the desire.</p>

      <p> A Short Interpretation Addressed to a Devout Christian</p>
      <p> I have. Sir, in receiving your inspiring letters, received you in your own person. Indeed, in spirit you are always present and cannot possibly be absent. Bat, following God's example, you have in your goodness also taken advantage of the opportunity God has given you to communicate with your servants. I have greatly admired your self-abasement, and have tempered my fear of you with affection, and from both have formed a love based on respect and goodwill. I have combined the two m case fear, stripped of affection, should turn into hatred, or affection, deprived of fear, should turn into over-familiarity. In this way love becomes an inward law of tenderness, assimilating everything naturally akin to It, mastering hatred through goodwill, and over-familiarity through respect.</p>
      <p> David the psalmist says, 'Fear of the Lord is pure, and endures for ever' (Ps. 19:9A because he knows that of all things fear is best able to preserve divine love. Such a fear is, he realizes, very different from the fear of being punished for crimes. This second type of fear is indeed ousted and destroyed by love, as John the Evangelist makes clear when he writes, "Love casts out fear' (1 John 4:18). But the fear-David is talking about is a natural expression of the law of true tenderness: and it is through this fear that the saints always keep intact the rule and practice of love, both for God and for each other.</p>
      <p> Thus, as have said, I too have tempered my fear of you. Sir, with affection and have maintained this law of love until now. Hitherto I have been held back from writing through respect, because I did not want to open the door to over-familiarity; but now I have been</p>
      <p> [V2] 286</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> impelled to write through goodwill, lest my failure to do so should be construed as hatred. And so, as requested, I write, not what I thmk - for, as Scripture says, 'men's thoughts are pathetic" (Wisd. 9:14) - but what God wills and grants by grace so that good may come of it; for 'the Lord's counsel stands for ever,' says David, 'and the thoughts of His heart from generation to generation' (Ps. 33:11). Perhaps the, counsel of God the Father to which David here refers is the unfathomable self-emptying of the only-begotten Son which He brought about for the deification of our</p>
      <p> nature, and by which He has set a hmit to the ages; and perhaps the thoughts of His heart are the principles of providence and judgment by which He wisely orders our present and future life as if they were separate generations, assigning to each its appropriate mode of activity.</p>
      <p> If the purpose of the divine counsel is the deification of our nature, and the aim of divine thoughts is to supply the prerequisites of our life, it follows that we should both know and carry into effect the power of the Lord's Prayer, and write about it in the proper way. And since you. Sir, in writing to me your servant have been inspired by God to mention this prayer in particular, it is necessarily the subject of my own words as well; hence I beseech the Lord, who has taught us this prayer, to open my intellect so that it may grasp the mysteries contained in it, and to give me words equal to the task of elucidating what I have understood. For hidden within a limited compass this prayer contains the whole purpose and aim of which we have just spoken; or, rather, it openly proclaims this purpose and aim to those whose intellects are strong enough to perceive them. The prayer includes petitions for everything that the divine Logos effected through His self-emptying in the incarnation, and it teaches us to strive for those blessings of which the true provider is God the Father alone through the natural mediation of the Son in the Holy Spirit. For the Lord Jesus is mediator between God and men, as the divine apostle says (cf. 1 Tim; 2:5), since He makes the unknown Father manifest to men through the flesh, and gives those who have been reconciled to Him access to the Father through the Holy Spirit (cf. Eph. 2:18). It was on their behalf and for their sake that without changing He became man, and is now the author and teacher of so many and such great new mysteries as yet beyond our understanding.</p>
      <p> [V2] 287</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> Of these mysteries that He has granted to men in His boundless generosity, seven are of more general significance; and it is these whose power, as I have said, lies hidden within the Lord's Prayer/ These seven are theology, adoption as sons by grace, equality with the angels, participation in eternal life, the restoration of human nature when it is reconciled dispassionately with itself, the abolition of the law of sin, and the destruction of the tyranny that holds us in its power through the deceit of the evil one.</p>
      <p> Let us examine the truth of what we have said. Theology is taught us by the incarnate Logos of God, since He reveals in Himself the Father and the Holy Spirit. For the whole of the Father and the whole of the Holy Spirit were present essentially and perfectly in the whole of the incarnate Son. They themselves did not become incarnate, but the Father approved and the Spirit co-operated when the Son Himself effected- His incarnation. At the incarnation the Logos preserved His intellect and His life unimpaired: except by the Father and the Spirit He was not comprehended in essence by any other being whatsoever, but in His love for men was united hypostatically with the flesh.</p>
      <p> The Logos bestows adoption on us when He grants us that birth and deification which, transcending nature, comes</p>
      <p> by grace from above through the Spirit, The guarding and preservation of this in God depends on the resolve of those thus bom: on their sincere acceptance of the grace bestowed on them and, through the practice of the commandments, on their cuhivation of the beauty given to them by grace. Moreover, by emptying themselves of the passions they lay hold of the divine to the same degree as that to which, deliberately emptying Himself of His own sublime glory, the Logos of God truly became man.</p>
      <p> The Logos has made men equal to the angels. Not only did He 'make peace through the blood of His Cross . .. between things on earth and things in heaven" (Col. 1:20), and reduce to impotence the hostile powers that fill m the intermediary region between heaven and earth, thereby making the festal assembly of earthly and heavenly powers a single gathering for His distribution of divme gifts, with humankind joining joyfully with the powers on high m unanimous praise of God's glory; but also, after fulfilling the divine purpose undertaken on our behalf, when He was taken up with the body which He had assumed. He united heaven and earth in Himself,</p>
      <p> [V2] 288</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> joined what is sensible with what is intelligible, and revealed creation as a single whole whose extremes are bound together through virtue and through knowledge of their first Cause. He shows, I think, through what He has accomplished mystically, that the Logos unites what is separated and that alienation from the Logos divides what is united. Let us learn, then, to strive after the Logos through the practice of the virtues, so that we may be united not only with the angels through virtue, but also with God in spiritual knowledge through detachment from created things.</p>
      <p> The Logos enables us to participate in divine life by making Himself our food, in a manner understood by Himself and by those who have received from Him a noetic perception of this kind. It is by tasting this food that they become truly aware that the Lord is full of virtue (cf Ps. 34:8). For He transmutes with divinity those who eat it, bringing about their deification, since He is the bread of life and of power in both name and reality.</p>
      <p> He restores human nature to itself. First, He became man and kept His will dispassionate and free from rebellion against nature, so that it did not waver in the slightest from its own natural movement even with regard to those who crucified Him: on the contrary, it chose death for their sake instead of life, thereby demonstrating the voluntary character of His passion, rooted as it is in His love for humankind. Second, having nailed to the Cross the record of our sins (cf. Col. 2:14), He abolished the enmity which led nature to wage an implacable war against itself; and-havmg summoned those far off and those near at hand - that is, those under the Law and those outside it - and</p>
      <p> having broken down the obstructive partition-waU - that is, having explained the law of the commandments in His teaching to both these categories of humankind - He formed the two into one new man, making peace and reconciling us through Himself to the Father and to one another (cf. Eph. 2:14-16): our will is no longer opposed to the principle of nature, but we adhere to it without deviating in either will or nature.</p>
      <p> The Logos purifies human nature from the law of sin by not permitting His incarnation for our sake to be preceded by sensual pleasure. For His conception took place miraculously without seed, and His birth supranaturally without the loss of His Mother's virginity. That is to say, when God was bom from His Mother, through His birth He tightened the bonds of her virginity in a manner</p>
      <p> [V2] 289</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> surpassing nature; and in those that are willing He frees the whole of human nature from the oppressive rule of the law which dominates it, in so far as they imitate His self-chosen death by mortifying the earthly aspects of themselves (cf. Col. 3:5). For the mystery of salvation belongs to those who choose it, not to those who are compelled by force.</p>
      <p> The Logos destroys the tyranny of the evil one, who dominates us through deceit, by triumphantly using as a weapon against him the flesh defeated in Adam. In this way he shows that what was once captured and made subject to death now captures the captor: by a natural death it destroys the captor's life and becomes a poison to him, making him vomit up all those he was able to swallow because he had the power of death. But to humankind it becomes life, like leaven in the dough impelling the whole of nature to rise like dough in the resurrection of life (cf 1 Cor. 5:6-7). It was to confer this life that the Logos who was God became man - a truly unheard of thing - and willingly accepted the death of the flesh.</p>
      <p> The Lord's Prayer, as I have said, contains a petition for each of these things. First, it speaks of the Father, His name, and His kingdom. Second, it shows us that the person who prays is by grace the son of this Father. It asks that those in heaven and those on earth may be united in one will. It tells us to ask for our dally bread. It lays down that men should be reconciled with one another and unites our nature with itself when we forgive and are forgiven, for then it is not split asunder by differences of will and purpose. It teaches us to pray against entering into temptation, since this is the law of sin. And it exhorts in to ask for deliverance from the evil one. For the author and giver of divine blessings could not but be our teacher as well, providing the words of this prayer as precepts of life for those disciples who believe in Him and follow the way He taught m the flesh. Through these words He has revealed the</p>
      <p> hidden treasures of wisdom and knowledge (of. Col. 2:3) that as pure form exist in Him; and in all who offer this prayer He kindles the desire to enjoy such treasures.</p>
      <p> It is for this reason, I think, that scripture calls this teaching 'prayer', since it contains petitions for the gifts that God gives to men by grace. Our divinely inspired fathers have explained prayer in a similar way, saying that prayer is petition for that which God naturally gives men to the manner appropriate to Him, while a vow.</p>
      <p> [V2] 290</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> conversely, is a promise of what men who worship God sincerely resolve to offer Him. The fathers cite many Scriptural texts to illustrate this distinction such as, 'Make your vows to the Lord our God and perform them' (Ps. 76:11. LXX), and 'I will give Thee, 0 Lord, what I have vowed' (Jonah 2:10. LXX), which refer to vows. On the subject of prayer they quote such texts as 'Hannah prayed to the Lord, saying, O Lord of hosts, if Thou wilt indeed listen to Thy handmaid and give me a child' (cf. ISam. 1:11), and 'Hezekiah the king of Judah and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz prayed to the Lord' (cf 2 Chr. 32:20), and 'Pray then like this: Our Father who art in heaven' (Matt. 6:9), as the Lord said to the disciples. Consequently, a vow is a decision to keep the commandments, confirmed by a promise on the part of the person making the vow; and a prayer is a petition by one who has kept the commandments that he may be transformed by the commandments he has kept. Or, rather, a vow is a contest of virtue that God welcomes most readily whenever it is offered to Him; and prayer is the prize of \'irtue that God gives joyfully when the contest is won.</p>
      <p> Since, then, prayer is petition for the blessings given by the incarnate Logos, let us make Him our teacher in prayer. And when we have contemplated the sense of each phrase as carefully as possible, let us confidently set it forth; for the Logos Himself gives us, in the manner that is best for us, the capacity to understand what He says.</p>
      <p> 'Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come" (Matt. 6:9-10) It is appropriate that at the outset the Lord should teach those who pray to start with theology, and should initiate them into the mode of existence of Him who is by essence the created Cause of all things. For these opening words of the prayer contain a revelation of the Father, of the name of the Father, and of the kingdom of the Father, so that from this beginning we may be taught to revere, invoke and worship the Trinity in unity. For the name of God the Father exists in substantial form as the only-begotten son. Again the kingdom of God the Father exists in substantial form as the Holy Spirit: what Matthew calls 'kingdom' in this context one of the other Evangelists has elsewhere called 'Holy Spirit', saying, 'May Thy Holy Spirit   come and purify</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> us. For the Father's name is sot something which He has acquired, nor is the kmgdom a dignity ascribed to Him: He does not have a beginning, so that at a certain moment He begins to be Father or King, but He is eternal and so is eternally Father and King. In no sense at all, therefore, has He either begun to exist or begun to exist as Father or King. And if He exists eternally, not only is He eternally Father and King but also the Son and Holy Spirit co-exist with Him eternally in substantial form, having their being from Him and by nature inhering in Him beyond any cause or principle: they are not sequent to Him, nor have they come into existence after Him in a contingent manner. The relationship of co-inherence between the Persons embraces all three of them simultaneously, not permitting any of the three to be regarded as prior or sequent to the others.</p>
      <p> At the outset of this prayer, then, we honor the coessential and supraessential Trinity as the creative cause of our coming into existence. Secondly, we are taught to proclaim the grace of our adoption, since we have been found worthy of addressing our Creator by nature as our Father by grace. Thus, venerating this title of our begetter by grace, we strive to stamp our Creator's qualities on our lives, sanctifying His name on earth, taking after Him as our Father, showing ourselves to be His children through our actions, and through all that we think or do glorifying the author of this adoption, who is by nature Son of the Father.</p>
      <p> We hallow or sanctify the name of our heavenly Father by grace when we mortify our desire for material things and purify ourselves of coiTupting passions. For sanctification is truly the complete mortification and cessation of desire in the senses. When we have achieved this we assuage the uncouth turbulence of our mcensive power, for the desire that arouses it and persuades it to fight for its own pleasures has now been quelled by holiness. For anger, being by nature the protagonist of desire, stops of its own accord when once it sees the desire has been put to death.</p>
      <p> It is thus fitting that, anger and desire repudiated, we should next</p>
      <p> [V2] 292</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> invoke the rule of the kingdom of God the Father with the words 'Thy kingdom come' (Matt. 6:10), that is, 'May the Holy Spirit come": for, having put away these things, we are now made into a temple for God through the Holy Spirit by the teaching and practice of gentleness. "For on whom shall I rest,' says Scripture, 'but on him who is gentle and humble, and trembles at my words?' (cf. Isa, 66:2). It is dear from this that the kingdom of God the Father belongs to the humble and the gentle. For 'blessed are the gentle, for they will inherit the earth' (Matt. 5:5). It is not this physical earth, which by nature occupies a middle place in the universe, that God promises as an inheritance for those who love Him - not, at least, if He is speaking truly when He says, 'In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in. marriage, but are as the angels in heaven' (Matt. 22:30), and 'Come, you whom my Father has blessed, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world' (Matt. 25:34), and elsewhere again to someone else who has striven with goodwill, 'Enter into the joy of your Lord' (Matt. 25:21). And after the Lord St Paul also says, 'The trumpet will sound and first the dead in Christ will rise up incorrupt; then we who are alive and remain will be caught up with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we shall be with the Lord for ever' (cf. 1 Thess. 4:16-17).</p>
      <p> Since these things have been promised to those who love the Lord, what man prompted by intelligence and wishing to serve it would ever say, from a literal reading of Scripture alone, that heaven, and the kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world, and the mystically hidden joy of the Lord, and the perpetual dwelling with the Lord enjoyed by the saints, are to be identified with the earth? In this text (Matt. 5:5) I drink that the word 'earth' signifies the resolution and strength of the inner stability, immovably rooted in goodness, that is possessed by gentle, people. This state of stability exists eternally with the Lord, contains unfailing joy, enables the gentle to attain the kingdom prepared from the beginning, and has its station and dignity in heaven. It also permits the gentle to inherit the principle of virtue, as if virtue were the earth that occupies a middle place in the universe. For the gentle person holds a middle position between honor and obloquy, and remains dispassionate, neither puffed up by the first nor cast down by the second. For the intelligence is by nature superior to both praise and blame;</p>
      <p> [V2] 293</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> and so, when it has put away the sensual desire, it is no longer troubled by either the one or the other, having anchored the whole power of the soul in divine and unassailable liberty. The Lord, wanting to impart this liberty to His disciples says, 'Take my yoke upon you and learn from Me; for I am gentle and humble in heart; and you will find rest for your souls' (Matt. 11:29). He calls the rule of the divine kingdom "rest' because it confers on those worthy of it a lordship free from all servitude.</p>
      <p> If the indestructible power of the pure kingdom is given to the humble and the gentle, what man will be so lacking in</p>
      <p> love and so completely without appetite for divine blessings that he will not desire the greatest degree of humility and gentleness in order to take on the stamp of the divine kingdom, so far as this is possible for men, and to bear in himself by grace an exact spiritual likeness of Christ, who is by nature the truly great king? In this likeness, says St Paul, 'there is neither male nor female' (Gal. 3:28), that is, there is neither anger nor desire. Of these, the first tyrannically perverts judgment and makes the mind betray the law of nature, while the second scorns the one dispassionate cause and nature, that alone is traly desirable, in favor of what is inferior, giving preference to the flesh rather than to the spirit, and taking pleasure more in visible things than in the magnificence and glory of intelligible realities. In this way with the lubricity of sensual pleasure it seduces the intellect from the divine perception of spiritual realities that is proper to it.</p>
      <p> It is our aim to make the intelligence stand alone, stripped through the virtues of its affection for the body: for this affection, even when totally dispassionate, is still natural. The spirit, completely triumphing over nature, has to persuade the intellect to desist from moral philosophy m older to commune with the supra-essential Logos through direct and undivided contemplation, in spite of the fact that moral philosophy help the intellect to cut itself off from, and to go beyond, things pertaining to the flux of time. For when the intellect has become free from its attachment to sensible objects, it should not be burdened my longer with preoccupations about morality as with a shaggy cloak.</p>
      <p> Elijah clearly reveals this mystery in a typological manner through his actions (cf. 2 Kgs. 2:11-14). For when he was borne aloft he gave Elisha his cloak, that is, the mortification of the flesh which</p>
      <p> [V2] 294</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> constitutes the chief glory of moral conduct. He did this so that Elisha should have the support of the Spirit in his battle against hostile powers and should triumph over the flux and instability of nature, typified by the Jordan: so that, in other words, he would not be immersed in the turbidity and slime of material attachment and thus prevented from Crossing over into the holy land. Meanwhile, Elijah himself advanced freely towards God, Unencumbered by attachment to any created thing. His desire being undivided and his will unmixed, he made his dwelling with Him who is simple by nature, carried there by the interdependent cardinal virtues, harnessed spiritually to one another like horses of fire.</p>
      <p> Elijah knew that in the disciple of Christ there must be no imbalance of dispositions, for such diversity is proof of a lack of inward unity. Thus the passion of desire produces a diffusion of blood around the heart, and the mcensive power when roused causes the blood to boil. He who already lives and moves and has his being in Christ (cf. Acts</p>
      <p> 17:28) has annulled in himself the production of what is imbalanced and disunited: as 1 have said, he does not bear within him, like male and female, the opposing dispositions of such passions. In this way, the intelligence is not enslaved by the passions and made subject to their fickleness. Naturally endowed with the holiness of the divine image, the intelligence urges the soul to conform itself by its own free choice to the divine likeness, in this way the soul is able to participate in the great kingdom that exists in a substantive manner in God, the Father of all, and to become a translucent abode of the Holy Spirit, receiving - if it may be expressed in this way - the whole authority of the knowledge of the divine nature in so far as this is possible. Where this authority prevails, the production of what is inferior automatically comes to an end and only what is superior is generated; for the soul that through the grace of its calling resembles God keeps inviolate withm itself the Substance of the blessings bestowed upon it. In souls such as this Christ always desires to be bom in a mystical way, becoming incarnate in those who attain salvation, and making the soul that gives birth to Him a Virgin Mother; for such a soul, to put it briefly, is not conditioned by categories like those of male and female that typify a nature subject to generation and corruption.</p>
      <p> Let no one be shocked to hear me speak of the corruption that is inherent in generation. For when one has justly and dispassionately</p>
      <p> [V2] 295</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> examined the nature of what comes into being and ceases to be, one will clearly see that generation begins with corruption and ends in corruption. Christ, and the Christ-like way of life and understanding, as 1 have said, are free of the passions characteristic of such generation. At least, this is the case if St Paul was speaking the truth when he said that in Christ Jesus "there is neither male nor female" (Gal. 3:28), meaning by these terms the characteristics and passions of a nature subject to generation and corruption. For in Christ and the Christ-like way of life there is only a deifonn understanding imbued with divine knowledge, and a single disposition of will and purpose that chooses only virtue.</p>
      <p> Moreover, in Christ there is neither Greek nor Jew (cf. Gal. 3:28). By this is meant differing or, rather, contrary views about God. The Greek affirms a host of ruling principles and divides the one fundamental principle into opposing operations and powers, devising a polytheistic worship full of contradictions because of the multitude of objects to be venerated, and ridiculous because of its many modes of veneration. The Jew affirms a fundamental principle which, although one, is narrow, imperfect and almost non-existent, since it is devoid of immanent consciousness and life; and so he falls into an evil which is just as bad as that into which the Greek falls for the opposite reason, namely disbelief in the true God. For he limits the fundamental principle to a single Person, one that exists without Logos and Spirit, or that merely possesses Logos and Spirit as qualities; for he fails to realize</p>
      <p> what kind of God this would be if deprived of these two other Persons, or how He could be God if assigned them as accidents by participation, as is the case with created intelligent beings. Neither Greek nor Jew, then, has any place at all in Christ. In Him there is only the principle of true religion and the steadfast law of mystical theology, that rejects both the dilatation of the Divinity, as in Greek polytheism, and the contraction of the Divinity, as in Jewish monotheism. In this way the Divine is not full of internal contradictions, as it is with the Greeks, because of a natural plurality, nor is it regarded as passible, as it is by the Jews, because of being a single Person, deprived of Logos and Spirit, or only possessing Logos and Spirit as qualities, without itself being Intellect and Logos and Spirit.</p>
      <p> Mystical theology teaches us, who through faith have been adopted by grace and brought to the knowledge of truth, to recognize</p>
      <p> [V2] 296</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> one nature and power of the Divinity, that is to say, one God contemplated in Father, Son and Holy Spirit. It teaches us to know God as a single unoriginate Intellect, self-existent, the begetter of a single, self-existent, unoriginate Logos, and the source of a single everlasting life, self-existent as the Holy Spirit: a Trinity in Unity and a Unity in Trinity. The Divinity is not one thing in another thing: the Trinity is not in the Unity like an accident in a substance or vice versa, for God is without qualities. The Divinity is not one thing and another thing: the Unity does not differ from the Trinity by distinction of nature; the nature is simple and single in both. Nor in the Divinity is one thing dependent on or prior to another: the Trinity is not distinguished from the Unity, or the Unity from the Trinity, by inferiority of power; nor is the Unity distinguished from the Trinity as something common and general abstracted in a purely conceptual manner from the particulars in which it occurs: it is a substantively self-subsistent essence and a truly self-consolidating power. Nor in the Divinity has one thing come into being through another: there is withm it no such mediating relationship as that of cause and effect, since it is altogether identical with itself and free from relationships. Nor in the Divinity is one thing derived from another: the Trinity does not derive from the Unity, since it is ungenerated and self-manifested. On the contrary, the Unity and the Trinity are both affirmed and conceived as truly one and the same, the first denoting the principle of essence, the second the mode of existence. The whole is the single Unity, not divided by the Persons; and the whole is also the single Trinity, the Persons of which are not confused by the Unity. Thus polytheism is not introduced by division of the Unity or disbelief in the true God by confusion of the Persons.</p>
      <p> When Christian doctrine avoids these errors it achieves a genuine splendor. By Christian doctrine I mean the teaching of Christ, the new proclamation of trath in which there is neither male nor female, that is, the signs and</p>
      <p> passions of human nature when subject to birth and decay; neither Greek nor Jew, that is, contrary views of the Divinity; neither uncircumcision nor circumcision (cf. Col. 3:11), that is, the different kinds of worship appropriate to these views, the first divinizing nature because of the passions and setting the creature against the Creator, and the second because of its misuse of symbols of the Law vilifying visible creation and</p>
      <p> [V2] 297</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> slandering the Creator as the source of evil. Both constitute equally an insult to the Divine and lead equally to evil. Neither in Christian doctrine is there barbarian or Scythian, that is, the deliberate fragmentation of the single nature of human beings which has made them subject to the unnatural law of mutual slaughter; neither is there bond or free, that IS, the fortuitous division of this same nature which leads to one person despising another although both are by nature of an equal dignity, and which encourages men to dominate others tyrannically, thus violating the divine image in man. 'But Christ is all and in all' (Col. 3:11), in spirit fashioning the unongmate kingdom by means of that which lies beyond nature and law.</p>
      <p> This kingdom is characterized, as we have shown, by humility and gentleness of heart. It is the combination of these two qualities that constitutes the perfection of the person-created according to Christ. For every humbler person is invariably gentle and every gentle person is invariably humble. A person is humble when he knows that his very being is on loan to him. He is gentle when he realizes how to use the powers given to him in a manner that accords with nature and, withdrawing their activity completely from the senses, places them at the service of the intelligence in order to produce the virtues. In this way his intellect moves incessantly towards God, while where his senses are concerned he is not in the least perturbed by any of the things that afflict the body, nor does he stamp his soul with any trace of distress, thereby disrupting his joy-creative state. For he does not regard what is painful in the senses as a privation of pleasure: He knows only one pleasure, the marriage of the soul with the Logos. To be deprived of this marriage is endless torment, extending by nature through all the ages. Thus when he has left the body and all that pertains to it, he is impelled towards union with the divine; for even if he were to be master of the whole world, he would still recognize only one real disaster: failure to attain by grace the deification for which he is hoping.</p>
      <p> Let us, then, 'cleanse ourselves from all pollution of the flesh and spirit' (2 Cor. 7:1), so that when we have extinguished our sensual desire, which indecently wantons with the passions, we may hallow the divine name. And with our intelligence let us bind fast our anger, deranged and frenzied by sensual pleasure, so that we may</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> receive the kingdom of God the Father, that comes to us through gentleness.</p>
      <p> Having done all this, we may go on to the next phrase of the prayer, saying, 'Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven' (Matt. 6:10). He who worships God mystically with the faculty of the intelligence alone, keeping it free from sensual desire and anger, fulfils the divine will on earth just as the orders of angels fulfill it in heaven. He has become in all things a co-worshipper and fellow-citizen with the angels, conforming to St Paul's statement, 'Our citizenship is in heaven' (Phil. 3:20). Among the angels desire does not sap the intellect's intensity through sensual pleasure, nor does anger make them rave and storm indecently at their fellow creatures: there is only the intelligence naturally leading intelligent beings towards the source of intelligence, the Logos Himself. God rejoices in intelligence alone and this is what He demands from us His servants. He reveals this when He says to David, 'What have I in heaven, and besides yourself what have I desired on earth?' (Ps. 73:25. LXX). Nothing is offered to God in heaven by the holy angels except intelligent worship; and it is this that God also demands from us when He teaches us to say in our prayers, 'Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven' (Matt. 6:10).</p>
      <p> Let our intelligence, then, be moved to seek God, let our desire be roused in longing for Him, and let our incensive power struggle to keep guard over our attachment to Him. Or, more precisely, let our whole intellect be directed towards God, tensed by our incensive power as if by some nerve, and fired with longing by our desire at its most ardent. For if we imitate the heavenly angels in this way, we will find ourselves always worshipping God, behaving on earth as the angels do in heaven. For, like that of the angels, our intellect will not be attracted in the least by anything less than God.</p>
      <p> If we live in the way we have promised, we will receive, as daily and life-giving bread for the nourishment of our souls and the maintenance of the good state with which we have been blessed, the Logos Himself; for if was He who said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven and gives life to the world', (cf. John 6:33-35). In proportion to our capacity the Logos will become everything for us who are nourished through virtue and wisdom; and in accordance with His own judgment He will be embodied differently in each recipient of salvation while we are still living in this age. This</p>
      <p> [V2]299</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> is indicated in the phrase of the prayer which says, 'Give us this day our daily bread" (Matt. 6:11).</p>
      <p> I believe that the expression "this day" refers to the present age. It is as if one should say, after a clearer understanding of the context of the prayer, "Since we are in this present mortal life, give us this day our daily bread which Thou hast originally prepared for human nature so that it might become immortal (cf Gen. 1:9); for in this way the food of the bread of life and knowledge will triumph over the death that comes through sin." The transgression of the divine commandment prevented the first man from partaking of this bread (cf. Gen. 3:19). Indeed, had he taken his fill of this divine food, he would not have been made subject to death through sin.</p>
      <p> He who prays to receive this daily bread, however, does not automatically receive it all as it is in itself: he receives it in accordance with his receptive capacity. For the Bread of Life in His love gives Himself to all who ask, but He does not give to all in the same way. He gives liberally to those who have done great things, and more sparingly to those who have achieved less. Thus He gives to each person in accordance with the receptive capacity of his or her intellect.</p>
      <p> The Savior Himself has led me to this interpretation of the phrase we are considering, because He commands His disciples explicitly not to take any thought at all for sensible food saying, "Do not worry about your life, what you will eat, or what you will drink, or about your body, what you will put on. For the heathen seek all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things as well will be given to you' (Matt. 6:25, 32, 33). How then can it be that He teaches us to pray for what He commands us not to seek? Obviously He does not order us to do anything of the kind: we should ask in prayer only for things that we are commanded to seek. If the Savior commanded us to seek only the kingdom of God and righteousness, then surely He intended those who desire divine gifts to ask for this kingdom in their prayers, in this way, by showing what petitions are blessed by His grace. He conjoins the intention of those who ask with the will of Him who bestows the grace.</p>
      <p> If, however, we also take this clause to mean we should pray for the daily bread that sustains our present life, let us be careful not to overstep the bounds of the prayer, presumptuously assuming that</p>
      <p> [V2]300</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> we will live for many cycles of years and forgetting that we are mortal and that our life passes by like a shadow; but free from anxiety let us pray for bread sufficient for one day at a time, thus showing that as Christian philosophers we make life a rehearsal for death, in our purpose anticipating nature and, even before death comes, cutting off the soul's anxiety about bodily things. In this way the soul will not transfer its natural appetite to material things, attaching itself to what is corruptible, and will not learn the greed that deprives it of a rich possession of divine blessings.</p>
      <p> Let us therefore shun the love of matter and our attachment to matter with all the strength we have, as if washing dust from our spiritual eyes; and let us be satisfied simply with what sustains our present life, not with what pampers it. Let us pray to God for (his, as we have been taught, so that we may keep our souls unenslaved and absolutely free from domination by any of the visible things loved for the sake of the body. Let us show that we eat for the sake of living, and not be guilty of living for the sake of eating. The first is a sign of intelligence, the second proof of its absence. And let us be exact in the way we observe this prayer, thereby showing through our actions that we cleave fast to the one life lived in the spirit alone, and that we use our present life to acquire this spiritual life. We use it, that is to say, only in so far as we do not refuse to sustain our body with bread and to keep it as far as possible in its natural state of good health, our aim being not just to live but to live for God. For we make the body, rendered intelligent by the virtues, a messenger of the soul, and the soul, once it is firmly established in the good, a herald of God; and on the natural plane we restrict our prayer for this bread to one day only, not daring to extend our petition for it to a second day because of Him who gave us the prayer. When we have thus conformed ourselves to the sense of the prayer, we can proceed, in purity to the next petition, saying, 'And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors' (Matt. 6:12).</p>
      <p> According to the first interpretation proposed for the preceding section of the prayer, the words 'this day" symbolize the present age; and the person who prays in this age for the incorruptible bread of wisdom, from which we were cutoff by the original transgression, delights in one thing only: the attaimnent of divme   blessings. It is God</p>
      <p> who by nature bestows these blessings, but it is the recipient's free will that safeguards them. Similarly, such a person knows only</p>
      <p> [V2] 301</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> one pain: the failure to attain these blessings. It is the devil who prompts this failure, but it is the person himself who makes it an actuality, because of his weakness of will with regard to the divine, and because he does not hold fast to</p>
      <p> the precious gift for which he has prayed. But if someone is not in the least concerned with anything in the visible world, and consequently is not overcome by any bodily affliction, then such a person truly and dispassionately forgives those who sin against him: for no one can rob him of the good to which he aspires and which by nature is unassailable.</p>
      <p> A person of this land makes himself a pattern of virtue for God, if it may be put in this way: for by saying 'Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors', he exhorts God, who is beyond imitation, to come and imitate him: and he begs God to treat him as he himself has treated his neighbors. For he wishes to be forgiven by God as he himself has forgiven the debts of those who have sinned against him: hence, just as God dispassionately forgives His creatures, so such a person must himself remain dispassionate in the face of what happens to him and forgive those who offend him. He must not allow the memory of things that afflict him to be stamped on his intellect lest he inwardly sunders human nature by separating himself from some other man, although he is a man himself. When a man's will is in union with: the principle of nature in this way, God and nature are naturally reconciled: but, failing such a union, our nature remains self-divided in its will and cannot receive God's gift of Himself.</p>
      <p> This surely is why God wishes us first to be reconciled with one another. He Himself has no need to learn from us how to be reconciled with sinners and to waive the penalty for a multitude of atrocious crimes: but He wishes to purify us of our passions and show us that the measure of grace conferred on those who are forgiven corresponds to their inward state. It is evident that when man's will is m union with the principle of nature, he is not m a state of rebellion against God. Since the principle of nature is a law both natural and divine, and there is nothing in it contrary to the Logos, when a man's will functions in accordance with this principle it accords with God in all things. Such a condition of the will is an inner state actively characterized by the grace of what is good by nature and hence productive of virtue.</p>
      <p> This, then, is the inner state of the man who prays for Gnostic</p>
      <p> [V2]302</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> bread. After him comes the man who, constrained by nature, seeks ordinary bread, but sufficient for one day only. He will attain the same inner state as the first when he has forgiven his debtors their debts, as he knows that he is by nature mortal. Moreover, by accepting the uncertainty of the future and waiting each day for what is provided by nature, he anticipates nature, choosing to become dead to the world and to comply with the text, 'For Thy sake we are put to death all the day long: we are regarded as sheep for slaughtering' (Ps. 44:22: Rom. 8:36). He makes his</p>
      <p> peace with all in order to be free from all the depravities of this present age when he departs to eternal life, and to receive from the Judge and Savior of the universe a just recompense for what he has done in this life. Both these kinds of men, therefore, need to exhibit a pure disposition towards those who have offended them. This is true in general: but it has particular reference to the concluding words of the prayer: 'And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from what is evil' (Matt. 6:13).</p>
      <p> Scripture reveals in these words that he who has not completely forgiven those who stumble, and has not brought his heart to God free from grievance and illuminated with the light of reconciliation with his neighbor, will fail to attain the grace of the blessings he has prayed for. Indeed, he will justly be handed over to temptation and to evil, so that, having retracted his judgments of other people, he may learn to purify himself of his own sins. Scripture here means by temptation the law of sin, of which the first man was free when he was created. And by 'what is evil' it means the devil, who has mixed this law of sin with human nature, deceitfully persuading man to transfer his soul's desire from what is permitted to what is forbidden, and to turn aside to the transgression of the divine commandment. The result of this is the loss of the incorruptibility which had been given by grace.</p>
      <p> Alternatively, by temptation Scripture means the soul's predilection for the passions of the flesh: and by 'what is evil' the actual way in which this impassioned proclivity is satisfied. The just Judge does not liberate a man from either of these if he has not forgiven his debtors their debts. So long as he prays merely in words for liberation, God. allows him to be defiled by the law of sin: and so long as his will is stubborn and raw. He abandons him to the domination of evil: for he has chosen the shameful passions (cf Rom. 1:26),</p>
      <p> [V2] 303</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> of which the devil is the sower, in preference to nature, of which God is the creator. God leaves him free to incline, if he so wishes, towards the passions of the-flesh, and actually to satisfy that inclination. Valuing the insubstantial passions more highly than nature, in his concern for these passions he has become ignorant of the principle of nature. Had he followed that principle, he would have known what constitutes the law of nature and what the tyranny of the passions - a tyranny brought about, not by nature, but by deliberate choice. He would then have accepted the law of nature that is maintained through activities which are natural: and he would have expelled the tyranny of the passions completely from his will. He would have obeyed nature with his intelligence, for nature in itself is pure and undefiled, faultless, free from hatred and alienation, and he would have made his will once more a companion to nature, totally stripped of everything not bestowed by the principle of nature. In this way he would have eradicated all hatred for and all alienation from what is by nature akm to him, so that when saying this prayer he would be heard and would receive from God a double rather than a single grace: forgiveness for offences already</p>
      <p> committed, and protection and deliverance from those which lie in the future. For he would not be allowed to enter into temptation and to fall into the power of evil for one simple reason: his readiness to forgive his neighbors their debts.</p>
      <p> Thus - to go back a little and comment briefly on what has been said - if we really wish to be delivered from evil and not to enter into temptation, we should trust in God and forgive our debtors their debts. "For if you do not forgive people their sins', says Scripture, 'your heavenly Father will not forgive you yours' (Matt. 6:15). We should do this not only to receive forgiveness for the offences we have committed, but also to defeat the law of sin -because then we would not be allowed to undergo the experience of bemg tempted by it - and to trample on the originator of this law, the evil serpent from whom we entreat God to deliver us. For Christ, who has overcome the world (cf. John 16:33), is our leader. He arms us with the laws of the commandments, and by enabling us to reject the passions He unites us m pure love with nature itself. Being the bread of life, of wisdom, spiritual knowledge and righteousness. He arouses in us an insatiable desire for Himself If we fulfill His Father's will He makes us co-worshippers with the</p>
      <p> [V2] 304</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> angels, when in our conduct we imitate them as we should and so conform to the heavenly state. Then He leads us up still further on the supreme ascent of divine truth to the Father of lights, and makes us share in the divine nature (cf. 2 Pet. 1:4) through participation by grace in the Holy Spirit. By virtue of this participation we are called children of God and, cleansed from all stain, in a manner beyond circumscription, we all encircle Him who is the author of this grace and by nature the Son of the Father. From Him, through Him and in Him we have and always will have our being, our movement and our life (cf. Acts 17:28).</p>
      <p> When we pray, let our aim be this mystery of deification, which shows us what we were once like and what the self-emptying of the only-begotten Son through the flesh has now made us; which shows us, that is, the depths to which we were dragged down by the weight of sin, and the heights to which we have been raised by His compassionate hand. In this way we shall come to have greater love for Him who has prepared this salvation for us with such wisdom. Bringing the prayer to fulfillment through our actions, we shall manifestly proclaim God as our true Father, by grace. We shall show that the evil one, who is always tyrannically attempting to gain control of our nature through the shameful passions, is not the father of our life, and that we are not unwittingly exchanging life for death. For both God and the devil naturally impart their qualities to those who approach either of them: God bestows eternal life on those who love Him, while the devil, operating through temptations that we subject to our volition, causes the death of his followers.</p>
      <p> For according to Scripture there are two kinds of temptation, one pleasurable, the other painful. One is the result of deliberate choice: the other is unsought. The first kind generates sin. We have been commanded by the Lord's teaching to pray not to fall into this, for He says, "Lead us not into temptation" (Matt. 6:13), and 'Watch and pray so that you do not enter into temptation' (Matt. 26:41). The other kind of temptation punishes sin, chastising a sin-loving disposition with sufferings that are unsought. To the person who endures this kind of temptation - which comes in the form of a trial - and who in particular is not riveted to evil, the words of the apostle James may be applied: 'My brethren, regard it as a great joy whenever you find yourselves beset by many trials; because the testing of your faith produces patient endurance; this endurance</p>
      <p> [V2] 305</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> shapes the character; and the character thus shaped should be brought to fruition' (cf. Jas. 1:2-4: Rom. 5:4). The evil one works his malice both through the temptation that is subject to our volition and through the trial that comes unsought. Where the first is concerned, by sowing the soul with bodily pleasures and by exciting it in this manner, he contrives to divert its desire away from divine love. Where the trial is concerned, in his wish to destroy nature through pain, he cunningly tries to force the soul, enervated by its sufferings, to calumniate and abuse the Creator.</p>
      <p> But, knowing the wiles of the evil one, let us pray for deliverance from the temptations subject to our volition, so that we do not defied our desire from divine love; and let us bravely endure the trials that come unsought, since they visit us with God's consent and by enduring them we show that we have not put nature before the Creator of nature. May all of us who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ be delivered from the present delights and the future afflictions of the evil one by participating in the reality of the blessings held in store and already revealed to us in Christ our Lord Himself, who alone with the Father and the Holy Spirit is praised by all creation. Amen.</p>
