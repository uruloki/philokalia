      <p> [V4] 30</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> not only the body's sensual pleasure, but also its mindless impulses;</p>
      <p> and we should strive to mortify it through suffering. For it is through the body that our desires are roused and stirred into action; and so long as it is alive, our soul will inevitably be dead, slow to respond and even impervious to every divine command.</p>
      <p> 28.  Just as a flame always rises no matter in what direction one turns the wood on which it bums, so the heart of an arrogant person cannot humble itself; the more one says to help him, the greater his self-inflation. Corrected or admonished, he reacts violently; and when praised or encouraged, his exultation knows no bounds.</p>
      <p> 29.  A person in the habit of contradicting others becomes a two-edged sword to himself. Unwittingly he destroys his own soul and alienates it from eternal life.</p>
      <p> 30.  A contentious person is like someone who deliberately gives himself over to the enemies of his king. Contentiousness is a trap whose bait is self-justification; deceived by it we swallow the hook of sin. Then our unhappy soul is caught, tongue and 'throat, by the demons. Sometimes they exalt it to the heights of pride and sometimes cast it down into the depths of sin, to be judged with those who have fallen from heaven.</p>
      <p> 31.  A person who suffers bitterly when slighted or insulted should recognize from this that he still harbors the ancient serpent in his breast. If he quietly endures the insult or responds with great humility, he weakens the serpent and lessens its hold. But if he replies acrimoniously or brazenly, he gives it strength to pour its venom into his heart and to feed mercilessly on his guts. In this way the serpent becomes increasingly powerful; it destroys his soul's</p>
      <p> strength and his attempts to set himself right, compelhng him to live for sin and to be completely dead to righteousness.</p>
      <p> 32.  If you want to renounce the world and to be instructed in life according to the Gospels, do not place yourself in the hands of an inexperienced master or one subject to the passions; for then you will be taught, not the ways of the Gospels, but those of the devil. Good masters impart good teaching, but the evil teach evil. Bad seed produces rotten fruit.</p>
      <p> 33.  Implore God with prayers and tears to send you a guide who is dispassionate and holy. But you yourself should also study the divine writings - especially the works of the fathers that deal with the practice of the virtues -so that you can compare the teachings of your</p>
      <p> [V4]31</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> master with them; for thus you will see and observe them as in a mirror. Take to heart and keep in mind those of his teachings that agree with the divine writings, but separate out and reject those that are false and mcongruent. Otherwise you will be led astray. For in these days there are all too many deceivers and false prophets.</p>
      <p> 34.  A blind person who undertakes to guide others is a deceiver plunging into the pit of destruction those who follow him. As the Lord said: 'If the blind lead the blind, both wiU fall into the pit' (Matt. 15:14).</p>
      <p> 35.   The person blind to the One is utterly blind to everything; but he who sees in the One contemplates all things. He abstains from the contemplation of all things and at the same time enters into the contemplation of all things while remaining outside what he contemplates. Being .in the One he sees all things; and being in all things he sees nothing. The person who sees in the One perceives through the One both himself and all men and all things; hidden in the One, he sees nothing of anything.</p>
      <p> 36.  The person who has not consciously invested his intelligence and intellect with the image of our Lord Jesus Christ, the heavenly one, man and God, is still but flesh and blood. He cannot perceive spiritual glory solely through his intelligence, just as those blind from birth cannot know the sun's light solely through their intelligence.</p>
      <p> 37.  Whoever hears, sees and feels through his intelligence will know the meaning of what has just been said, because he already bears the image of the heavenly one (cf 1 Cor. 15:49) and has attained that perfect manhood which is the fullness of Christ (cf. Eph. 4:13). Such a person can also guide God's flock aright in the way of His commandments. But if someone does not understand what has been said, it is clear that the perceptive organs of his soul are neither purified nor in good health, and that it would be better for him to be led than to lead others at their peril.</p>
      <p> 38.  He who looks upon his teacher and guide as if he were God cannot call him into question. If he thinks and says that he can, he should know that he deceives himself, being ignorant of the attitude of holy men towards God.</p>
      <p> 39.  If you believe that your life and death are in the hands of your spiritual guide you will never contradict him. Ignorance of this engenders contentiousness, and this brings about spiritual and eternal death.</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> 40.  Before the accused receives his sentence, he is given an opportunity to speak in his own defense before the judge about what he has done; but once the facts have been established and the judge has given his verdict, the accused can say nothing, whether important or trivial, to those who execute his punishment.</p>
      <p> 41.   Before a monk has entered this court and has revealed what he has in his heart, he may perhaps argue with his spiritual guide, either out of ignorance or because he thinks he can keep things about himself hidden. But after he has revealed and sincerely confessed his thoughts, he cannot argue with the man who, after God, will be his judge and master until death. For when a monk has once entered this court and laid bare the secrets of his heart, he will know from the start - if he has any understanding at all - that he deserves a thousand deaths. He will believe that through humility and obedience he can be saved from all punishment and chastisement, if indeed he has truly grasped the nature of this mystery.</p>
      <p> 42.  If you keep these things indelibly in mind, your heart will never rebel when you are disciplined or admonished or criticized. But whoever falls victim to the evils of contentiousness and disbelief with respect to his spiritual father and teacher is while yet living dragged down pitifully into the depths of Hades. Being disobedient and a son of perdition he becomes the dwelling-place of Satan and all his unclean brood.</p>
      <p> 43.   I exhort you, who are under obedience, to meditate on these things constantly and to make every effort not to plunge into these infernal evils of which I have spoken. Entreat God fervently each day with these words: 'God and Lord of all, master of everything that has breath and soul, who alone canst cure me, hear my prayer, abject as I am. Root out of me and destroy through the inspiration of Thy Holy Spirit the serpent that dwells in me. Make me worthy, poor though I am and bereft of virtue, of falling with tears at the feet of my spiritual father. Move his holy soul to have mercy on me; and. Lord, bestow humility on my heart and give me such thoughts as befit a sinner who has resolved to repent before Thee. Do not abandon for ever a soul that has once submitted and has confessed to Thee, that has chosen and honored Thee above all me world. Thou knowest that I wish to be saved, even if my bad habits hinder me. But to Thee, 0 Lord, are possible all things that are impossible to men' (cf Luke 18:27).</p>
      <p> 44.   Those who with fear and trembling have laid a good foundation [V4] 33</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> of faith and hope in the court of devotion; who have planted their feet firmly on the rock of obedience to their spiritual father; who listen to his counsel as if it came from the mouth of God; and who with humility of soul build all this on the basis of obedience - such people will succeed immediately. They will achieve that great and primary task of denying themselves. For to fulfill the will of another and not one's own entails not only the denial of one's own soul, but also mortification towards the whole world.</p>
      <p> 45.   The demons rejoice when a person argues with his spiritual father, but angels marvel at him when he humbles</p>
      <p> himself to the point of death. For then he performs God's work, making himself like the Son of God who was obedient to His Father unto death, the death on the cross (cf Phil. 2:8).</p>
      <p> 46.  Contrition of heart, when excessive and untimely, troubles and darkens the mind, destroying the soul's humility and pure prayer, and paining the heart. This induces a hardening to the point of total insensibility; and by means of this the demons reduce spiritual people to despair.</p>
      <p> 47.  As you are a monk, such things may happen to you. If they do, you may still feel a great desire and eagerness for perfection, longing to fulfill all God's commandments and not wanting to err or sin even by uttering a single idle word (cf. Matt. 12:36), or to fall short of the saints of old in the practice of virtue, in spiritual knowledge and in contemplation. But then you may find yourself hampered by someone who sows tares of despondency. He tries to prevent you from climbing to such heights of holiness by discouraging you with various thoughts. For instance, he will tell you that it is impossible for you to be saved and to keep every single one of God's commandments while you live in this world. When this happens you should sit down in a solitary place by yourself, collect yourself, concentrate your thoughts and give good counsel to your soul, saying: 'Why, my soul, are you dejected, and why do you trouble me? Put your hope in God. for I will give thanks to Him; for my salvation lies not in my actions but in God (cf Ps. 42:5). Who will be vindicated by actions done according to the law (cf Gal. 2:16)? No living person will be vindicated before God (cf. Ps. 143:2). Yet by virtue of my faith in God I hope that in His ineffable mercy He will give me salvation. Get behind me, Satan (cf. Matt. 4:10; 16:23). I worship the Lord my God (cf. Matt. 4:10; Luke 4:8) and serve Him from my youth; for He is able to save me simply</p>
      <p> [V4] 34</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> through His mercy. Go away from me. The God who created me in His image and likeness will reduce you to impotence.'</p>
      <p> 48.  The only thing God requires of us is that we do not sin. But this is achieved, not by acting according to the law, but by carefully guarding the divine image in us and our supernal dignity. When we thus live in our natural state, wearing the resplendent robe of the Spirit, we dwell in God and God dwells in us. Then we are called gods by adoption and sons of God, sealed by the light of the knowledge of God (cf Ps. 4:6. LXX).</p>
      <p> 49.  Bodily listlessness and torpor, which affect the soul as a result of our laziness and negligence, not only make us abandon our normal rule of prayer, but also darken the mind and fill it with despondency. Then blasphemous and cowardly thoughts arise in the heart. Indeed, the person tempted by the demon of listlessness cannot even enter his usual place of prayer; he grows sluggish, and absurd thoughts directed against the Creator of all things arise in his mind. Aware of the cause of all this and why it has happened to you, resolutely enter your normal place of prayer and, falling down before the God of love, ask with a compunctive and aching heart, full of tears, to be freed from the weight of listlessness and from your pernicious thoughts. If you knock hard and insistently, this release will soon be given to you.</p>
      <p> 50.  The person who has attained purity of heart has triumphed over cowardice. The person still in the process of being purified sometimes overcomes it and sometimes is overcome by it. The person not even engaged in spiritual</p>
      <p> warfare is either completely unaware that he is the ally of his own passions and of the demons and that he is sick with pride and presumption, thinking he is something when he is not; or else he is the slave and servant of cowardice, trembling like a baby and fearing fear where, for those who fear the Lord, there is no fear (cf Ps. 14:5. LXX) nor any occasion for cowardice.</p>
      <p> 51.  Whoever fears the Lord will not fear the sickly attacks of demons or the threats of evil people. Like a flame or a burning fire, he goes about day and night through dark and hidden places, and instead of fleeing from the demons he makes them flee from him, so as not to be scorched by the flaming rays of divine fire that pour from him.</p>
      <p> 52.   Whoever goes in the fear of God is not afraid when surrounded by evil men, for he has the fear of God within him and wears the invincible amour of faith. This gives him strength to do all things, even those that seem to most people difficult or impossible. Like a giant</p>
      <p> [V4] 35</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> among monkeys or a roaring lion among dogs and foxes, he is resolute in the Lord, unnerving his enemies with the constancy of his purpose and filling their minds with terror; for he wields God's wisdom like a rod of iron (cf. Ps. 2:9).</p>
      <p> 53.   Not only the hesychast, living alone, or the monk under obedience, but also the abbot, the spiritual director of many, and even a monk charged with specific duties, need to be detached and completely free from all worldly cares. For if we are not detached, we transgress the commandment of God which says, 'Do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or drink, or what you will wear; for it is the heathen who worry about all these things' (Matt. 6:25, 32). And again, 'Take care that your heart is not weighed down by dissipation, drunkenness and worldly cares'(Luke 21:34).</p>
      <p> 54.  A person full of anxiety about worldly things is not free: he is dominated and enslaved by this anxiety, whether it is about himself or about others. But he who is free from such things is untroubled by worldly concerns, whether they relate to himself or to others; and this is so, even if he is a bishop, abbot or priest. However, he will not be idle, or neglect even the most insignificant and trivial details; but all he does he will do for the glory of God, accomplishing everything in his life without anxiety.</p>
      <p> 55.  Do not pull down your own house because you want to build a house for your neighbor. Think how exhausting and difficult the task will be. Otherwise you may make your decision only to find that, having destroyed your own house, you lack the strength to build a house for someone else.</p>
      <p> 56.  Unless you are completely detached from worldly affairs and possessions, do not voluntarily assume responsibility for such things. Otherwise you may become caught up in them and, instead of receiving the reward for your services, may find yourself accused of theft and sacrilege. But if your abbot compels you to act as a steward, be like someone who holds in his hands a flaming fire; and if you ward off the attacks of your own evil thoughts through repentance and confession, you will be kept unharmed through the prayers of your superior.</p>
      <p> 57.  Unless you have become dispassionate you cannot know what dispassion is, and will not believe that a dispassionate person exists anywhere on earth. For unless someone has first denied himself, readily giving his blood</p>
      <p> for the sake of a life that is truly blessed, how [V4] 36</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> can he imagine that anyone else has done this in order to attain the state of dispassion? It is the same with someone who thinks that he possesses the Holy Spirit while in fact he possesses nothing of the kind. When he hears about the workings of the Spirit in those who do possess Him, he refuses to believe that there is anyone in our generation who is energized and motivated by the Holy Spirit, or who consciously and experientially enjoys the vision of Him, in the same way as Christ's apostles and the saints from the beginning of the world. For each judges whether his neighbor's condition is virtuous or vicious according to his own state.</p>
      <p> 58.   A dispassionate soul is one thing, a dispassionate body is another. For the soul, when dispassionate, sanctifies the body with its own luminosity and with the radiance of the Holy Spirit. But bodily dispassion by itself confers no benefit on the person who possesses it.</p>
      <p> 59.  A person who is raised by the king from extreme poverty to wealth, who is invested by him with high office and a splendid uniform and commanded to stand in his presence, will be full of devotion for the king and will revere him as his benefactor. He will be fully aware of his splendid robes, of his high office and the wealth he has been given. Similarly, if a monk has truly withdrawn from the world and its affairs and has come to Christ, if he is fully conscious of his calling and has been raised to the heights of spiritual contemplation through the practice of the commandments, then he will look unwaveringly on God and be well aware of the change that has taken place in him. He will see the grace of the Spirit always illuminating him - the grace that is called a garment, the royal purple or, rather, that is Christ Himself, if it is indeed true that those who believe in Christ are clothed in Christ (cf Gal. 3:27).</p>
      <p> 60.  Many read the Holy Scriptures and hear them read. But few can grasp their meaning and import. For some what is said in the Scriptures is impossible, for others it is altogether beyond belief. Some again interpret them wrongly: they apply things said about the present to the future, and things said about the future to the past or else to what happens daily. In this way they reveal a lack of true judgment and discernment in things both human and divine.</p>
      <p> 61.  We, the faithful, should look upon all the faithful as one single being, and should consider that Christ dwells in each of them. We should have such love for each of them that we are willing to lay down our lives for him. Nor should we ever think or say that anyone is evil:</p>
      <p> [V4] 37</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> we should look on everyone as good, as I have already said. Even should you see someone overwhelmed by some passion, execrate, not him, but the passions that fight against him.  And if he is mastered by  desires and</p>
      <p> prepossessions, have even greater compassion for him; for you too may be tempted, subject as you are to the same fluctuations of beguihng materiahty.</p>
      <p> 62.  A person false through hypocrisy, or culpable because of his actions, or easily shattered by some passion, or who lapses slightly through negligence, must not be left in the company of those who are working together in harmony. On the contrary he must be excluded from their society as still corrupt and reprobate. Otherwise at some crucial moment he might break their chain of union, causing division where there should be none and distress both to those who are at the head of the chain - for they will be grieved for those who follow after them - and to those at the tail of the chain, who will suffer because they are cut off from those in front of them.</p>
      <p> 63.   Earth thrown on a fire puts it out. Similarly, worldly concerns and attachment to even the smallest and most insignificant thing quell the fervor initially burning in our hearts.</p>
      <p> 64.  If you are pregnant with the fear of death you will feel disgust for all food and drink and smart clothing. You will not even find pleasure in eating bread or drinking water. You will give your body only what it needs to keep alive; and you will not only renounce all self-will, but at the discretion of those to whom you are obedient you will become the servant of all.</p>
      <p> 65.  The person who from fear of punishment hereafter has placed himself as a slave in the hands of his spiritual fathers will not choose, even if commanded to do so, relief for his heart's suffering or deliverance from the bonds of his fear. Nor will he listen to those who out of friendship, or flattery, or in virtue of their authority, encourage him to seek such relief and freedom. On the contrary, he will choose what increases his suffering and heightens his fear, and will look with love on whatever helps another to inflict these things on him. Moreover, he will endure as though he never expected to be released; for hope of deliverance lightens one's burden, and this is harmful for someone who is repenting fervently.</p>
      <p> 66.  Fear of punishment hereafter and the suffering it engenders are beneficial to all who are starting out on the spiritual way. Whoever imagines that he can make a start without such suffering and fear, and</p>
      <p> [V4] 38</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> without someone to inflict them, is not merely basing his actions on sand but thinks that he can build in the air without any foundations at all; and this of course is utterly impossible, indeed, the suffering is the source of nearly all our joy, while the fear breaks the grip of all our sins and passions, and the one who inflicts these things brings us not death but eternal life.</p>
      <p> 67.  He who does not attempt to evade the suffering engendered by the fear of eternal punishment, but accepts it wholeheartedly, and even adds to it as he can, will rapidly advance into the presence of the King of kings. And as soon as he has beheld the glory of God, however obscurely, his bonds will be loosed: fear, his tormenter, will leave him, and his heart's suffering will be turned to joy. It will become a spring from which unceasing tears will flow visibly and which will fill him spiritually with peace, gentleness and inexpressible sweetness, as well as with courage and the capacity to submit to God's commandments freely and unreservedly. This is something impossible for those who are still- beginners, for it is the characteristic of such as are in the middle of their spiritual journey. As</p>
      <p> for the perfect, this spring becomes a hght within their hearts, suddenly changed and transformed as they are.</p>
      <p> 68.  The person inwardly illumined by the light of the Holy Spirit cannot endure the vision of it, but falls face down on the earth and cries out in great fear and amazement, since he has seen and experienced something that is beyond nature, thought or conception. He becomes like someone suddenly inflamed with a violent fever: as though on fire and unable to endure the flames, he is beside himself, utterly incapable of controlling himself. And though he pours forth incessant tears that bring him some relief, the flame of his desire kindles all the more. Then his tears flow yet more copiously and, washed by their flow, he becomes even more radiant When, totally incandescent, he has become like light, then the saying is fulfilled, 'God is united with gods and known by them', in the sense perhaps that He is now united to those who have joined themselves to Him, and revealed to those who have come to know Him.</p>
      <p> 69.  'Let no one deceive you with vain words' (Eph. 5:6), and let us not deceive ourselves: before we have experienced inward grief and</p>
      <p> [V4] 39</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> tears there is no true repentance or change of mind in us, nor is there any fear of God in our hearts, nor have we passed sentence on ourselves, nor has our soul become conscious of the coming judgment and eternal torments. Had we accused ourselves and realized these things in ourselves, we would have immediately shed tears; for without tears our hardened hearts cannot be mollified, our souls cannot acquire spiritual humility, and we cannot be humble. If we do not attain such a state we cannot be united with the Holy Spirit. And if we have not been united with the Holy Spirit through purification, we cannot have either vision or knowledge of God, or be initiated into the hidden virtues of humility.</p>
      <p> 70.  Those who simulate virtue and who, because of the sheepskin of the monastic habit, appear to be one thing outwardly but are something else inwardly - steeped perhaps in iniquity, jealousy, ambition, and foul pleasures - are revered by most people as saintly and dispassionate; for in most people the soul's eye is unpurified, and so they cannot recognize these impostors by their fruits (cf Matt. 7:15-16). Those, on the other hand, who are full of devoutness, virtue and simplicity of heart, and who are truly saints, are judged by most people to be like other men; and they pass them by with disdain, counting them as nothing.</p>
      <p> 71.  The garrulous and ostentatious man is thought by these people to be a spiritual master; but the quiet man, careful not to waste words, they regard as uncouth and inarticulate.</p>
      <p> 72.  The arrogant, sick with diabolic pride, reject anyone inspired by the Holy Spirit as if this saintly man were himself arrogant and filled with pride; for his words strike them like blows, yet do not move them to compunction. But whoever uses his inborn talents or education to spin long phrases, and who tells lies to people about their salvation, is welcomed by them and praised to the skies; and so no one among them is able to see the situation as it is and judge it accordingly.</p>
      <p> 73.  'Blessed are the pure in heart,' says God, 'for they shall see God' (Matt. 5:8). But purity of heart cannot be realized through one virtue alone, or through two, or ten; it can only be realized through all of them together, as if</p>
      <p> they formed but a single virtue brought to perfection. Even so the virtues cannot by themselves purify the heart without the presence and inner working of the Spirit. For just as the bronzesmith demonstrates his skill through his tools, but cannot make anything without the activity of fire, so a man using the virtues as tools</p>
      <p> [V4] 40</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> can do everything, given the presence of the fire of the Spirit; but without this presence these took remain useless and ineffective, not removing the stain that befouls the soul.</p>
      <p> 74.  Through holy baptism we are granted remission of our sins, are freed from the ancient curse, and are sanctified by the presence of the Holy Spirit. But we do not as yet receive the perfection of grace, as described in the words of Scripture, 'I will dwell in them, and move in them' (2 Cor. 6:16); for that is true only of those who are steadfast in faith and have demonstrated this through what they do. If after we have been baptized we gravitate towards evil and foul actions, we lose the sanctification of baptism completely. But through repentance, confession and tears we receive a corresponding remission of our former sins and, in this way, sanctification accompanied by the grace of God.</p>
      <p> 75.  Through repentance the filth of our foul actions is washed away. After this, we participate in the Holy Spirit, not automatically, but according to the faith, humility and inner disposition of the repentance in which our whole soul is engaged. In addition, we must also have received complete remission of our sins from our spiritual father. For this reason it is good to repent each day, in accordance with the commandment that tells us to do this; for the words, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has drawn near' (Matt. 3:2), indicate that the act of repentance is unending.</p>
      <p> 76.  The grace of the Holy Spirit is given as a pledge to souls that are betrothed to Christ; and just as without a pledge a woman cannot be sure that her union with her man will take place, so the soul will have no firm assurance that it will be joined for all eternity with its Lord and God, or be united with Him mystically and inexpressibly, or enjoy His unapproachable beauty, unless it receives the pledge of His grace and consciously possesses Him within Itself</p>
      <p> 77.  Just as an engagement is not binding unless the documents of the contract bear the signatures of trustworthy witnesses, so the illumination of grace is dependent upon the practice of the commandments and the actualization of the virtues. What witnesses are to a contract, the virtues and the practice of the commandments are to spiritual betrothal: through them everyone who is going to be saved secures the consummation of the pledge.</p>
      <p> 78.  It is as if the contract were written through the practice of the commandments and then signed and sealed by the virtues. Only then</p>
      <p> [V4] 41</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> does Christ, the bridegroom, give His ring - the pledge of the Holy Spirit - to the soul that is His bride-to-be.</p>
      <p> 79.  Before the marriage the bride-to-be receives nothing but the pledge given by her future husband; she waits until after the marriage to receive the dowry that has been agreed upon and the gifts promised with it. So the Church - the bride-to-be composed of all me faithful - and the soul of each of us first receive from Christ, the bridegroom-to-be, only the pledge of the Spirit. The eternal blessings and the kingdom of heaven are given subsequent to this earthly life, though both the Church and the individual soul have the assurance of them through the pledge they have received, in which, as in a mirror, what has been agreed is disclosed and confirmed by their Lord and God.</p>
      <p> 80.  If the bridegroom-to-be is delayed abroad or kept away by other business, and puts off the marriage for a while, and if the bride-to-be, indignant, rejects his love, erasing or tearing up the document that contains the pledge, she immediately loses all right to what she expected from him. The same is true where the soul is concerned. For if a person engaged in spiritual warfare should say 'How long must I suffer?' and begin to evade the rigor of the ascetic life and, as it were, to erase or tear up the contract through neglect of the commandments and by abandoning the constant task of repentance, then at once he forfeits completely the pledge given and his hope in God.</p>
      <p> 81.  Should the bride-to-be transfer her love from the man to whom she is affianced to another, sharing his bed, whether publicly or not, not only does she not receive anything of what her betrothed had promised her, but she may rightly expect the censure and punishment of the law. The same is true in our own case. If someone shifts the love he has for Christ, his betrothed, to the desire for some other thing, whether openly or in secret, and his heart is possessed by mat thing, he will become hateful and abhorrent to Christ, and unworthy of being united with Him. For it is written, 'I love them that love me' (Prov. 8:17).</p>
      <p> 82.  Each of us should be able to understand from these signs whether or not he has received the pledge of the Spirit from Christ, our Lord and Betrothed. If he has received it, he should strive to retain it; and if he has not yet been privileged to receive it, he should strive through good works and actions, and through fervent repentance, to receive it, and then to keep it through the practice of the commandments and the acquisition of the virtues.</p>
      <p> [V4] 42</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> 83.  The roof of a house rests on its foundations and walls; correspondingly the foundations themselves are laid in the manner required for them to serve as support for the roof. A roof cannot stand without foundations, and foundations without a roof serve no living or practical purpose. Similarly, God's grace is preserved through the practice of the commandments, while the practice of the commandments is as it were the foundation for the divine gift. The grace of the Spirit will not remain with us without the practice of the commandments, nor will the practice of the commandments serve any useful purpose without the grace of God.</p>
      <p> 84.  A house left without a roof through the neglect of the builder is not only useless, but brings ridicule on the builder. Similarly, a person who has laid foundations through the practice of the commandments, and has raised walls through the acquisition of the higher virtues, remains incomplete, and an object of pity to the perfect, if he does not receive the grace of the Spirit in the form of contemplation and spiritual knowledge. He will have been denied this grace for one of two reasons: either he has failed to repent; or, daunted by the serried ranks of the virtues</p>
      <p> as by a boundless forest, he may have overlooked one of them - one that may seem trivial to us, but is indispensable if the house of the virtues is to be completed, since without it that house cannot be roofed by the grace of the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 85.   The Son of God, God Himself, came down to earth in order to reconcile us. His enemies, to His Father, and to unite us consciously to Himself through His holy and coessential Spirit. How, then, can someone who lacks this grace of the Spirit achieve any other form of grace? Certainly he has not been reconciled to Christ, nor has he been united to Christ through participation in the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 86.  The person who participates in the Holy Spirit is freed from impassioned desires and sensual pleasures, but he is not divorced from his natural bodily needs. In virtue of his deliverance from the bonds of impassioned desire and his union with immortal tenderness and glory, he strives unflaggingly to attain the heights, to dwell there with God, and not to lose even for a moment his vision of God and his insatiable delight. But because he is fastened to the body and to corruption, he is dragged down and pulled along by them, and is turned towards earthly things. His distress at this must be as great, I imagine, as that of a sinner's soul when it is separated from the body.</p>
      <p> 87.   For someone who loves the body, mortal life, sensual pleasure, [V4] 43</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> and the material world, separation from them is death; but for someone who loves holiness. God. the immaterial world and virtue, true death is for the mind to be separated from them even briefly. If the eyes of a person who can see sensible light are closed for an instant or covered by someone else, he suffers and is distressed and cannot bear it, especially if he was looking at something important or unusual. But if someone is illumined by the Holy Spirit and, whether asleep or awake, sees spiritually those blessings that 'the eye has not seen, and the ear has not heard, and man's heart has not grasped' (1 Cor. 2:9), and 'that angels long to glimpse' (1 Pet. 1:12), how much more will he suffer and be tormented if he is torn away from the vision of these things? For this will seem to him like death, a veritable exclusion from eternal life.</p>
      <p> 88.  Many have called the eremitic life blessed, others, the communal or coenobitic life. Others again have described in this way leadership of the faithful, or the counseling, teaching and administration of churches. All of these are activities that provide people with nourishment in body and soul. But for my part I would not judge any one of them to be better than the others, nor would I say that one merits praise and another censure. But in every case, whatever our work or activity, it is the life led for God and according to God that is most blessed.</p>
      <p> 89.  Man's material life is based upon a variety of sciences and skills, each person practicing one or another of them and making his contribution. Thus, by giving and taking from one another, men satisfy their natural bodily needs. One can see the same thing among spiritual people, where one person pursues one virtue while another follows another path. But all are moving towards a single goal.</p>
      <p> 90.  The goal of all who pursue the spiritual path is to do the will of Christ, their God, to be reconciled with the Father through communion in the Spirit, and so to achieve their salvation. For only in this way is the soul's salvation attained. And if it is not attained, our labor is fatuous and our work vain. Every path of life is pointless that does not lead the person pursuing it to this consummation.</p>
      <p> 91.   The person who, totally forsaking the world, retires to the mountains as though in pursuit of stillness and who then showily writes to those in the world, blessing some and praising and flattering others, is like someone who, after divorcing a foul and slatternly whore of a wife and going off to a distant land to expunge even his memory of</p>
      <p> [V4] 44</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> her, then forgets why he came there and longs to write to those living with that whore, and sullied by her, even deeming them happy. If not bodily, at least in heart and in intellect he shares their passions, inasmuch as he deliberately condones their commerce with that woman.</p>
      <p> 92.  Those who purify their senses and hearts from every evil desire while living in the world indeed deserve praise and are surely blessed. Correspondingly, those who dwell in mountains and caves, but who pursue human praise and blessing, deserve censure and rejection. In the eyes of God, diviner of our hearts, they are adulterers. For the person who wants his life and name and ascetic practice to be known in the world prostitutes himself in God's sight, as, according to David, the Jewish people once did (cf Ps. 106:39).</p>
      <p> 93.  Whoever renounces the world and worldly things with unhesitating faith in God believes that the Lord is compassionate and merciful and that He receives those who come to Him in repentance. But he knows, too, that God honors His servants with dishonor, enriches them with the utmost poverty, and glorifies them by means of insults and scorn, making them through death participants and inheritors of eternal life. Through such trials the servant of God is impelled like a panting hart to the deathless fountain (cf. Ps. 42:1);</p>
      <p> and through them he climbs upwards, as though up a ladder on which angels ascend and descend (cf. Gen. 28:12; John 1:51) in order to help those who are mounting. God is enthroned above, observing the strength of our intention and diligence, not because He enjoys seeing us struggle, but because He wishes, compassionate as He is, to give us our reward as if it were something He owed us.</p>
      <p> 94.  The Lord never allows those who come to Him unhesitatingly to fall completely. When He sees them faltering He helps them in their efforts, stretching a hand of power down to them and drawing them up to Himself. He works with them visibly and invisibly, consciously and unconsciously, until, having climbed every step of the ladder, they draw near Him, wholly united with Him in His wholeness and forgetting all that is earthly. Whether they are there with Him in the body or out of the body, 1 cannot tell (cf. 2 Cor. 12:2); but they dwell with Him and enjoy His ineffable blessings.</p>
      <p> 95.  It is right for us to place the yoke of Christ's commandments on our shoulders from the start; and we should not resist or hang back. On the contrary, we should walk straight ahead wholeheartedly</p>
      <p> [V4] 45</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> obedient to them, making ourselves in truth the new paradise of God, until the Son comes to dwell in us with the Father through the Holy Spirit. Then, when He totally indwells us and is our master, whomever of us He commands and whatever ministry He entrusts us with, we will take it in hand and carry it out sedulously, as seems best to Him. But we must not seek this ministry prematurely, or consent to accept it when given by men; but we must persevere in the commandments of our Lord and God and await His orders.</p>
      <p> 96.  If, after we have committed ourselves to some form of ministry within the Church and have performed it honorably, the Spirit should then direct us to some other ministry or work or activity, we should not resist. For God does not want us to be idle, but neither does He want us to be confined for ever to the first work in which we engaged. On the contrary. He wants us to advance, moving always towards the realization of something better, acting in accordance with His will and not our own.</p>
      <p> 97.  Whoever strives to mortify his own will should' follow the will of God; and in the place of his own will he should put God's will, planting it in himself and grafting it into his heart. Moreover, he should carefully observe whether what he has planted has put down deep roots, whether what he has grafted has healed over so as to make a single tree, and whether it has grown and flowered and borne good, sweet fruit in such a way that he no longer recognizes the earth into which the seed was sown or the stock onto which the graft was made, so incomprehensible and miraculous is the life-bearing tree that has grown up.</p>
      <p> 98.  If through fear of God you cut off your own will - inexplicably, for you do not know how this happens - God will give you His will. You will keep it indelibly in your heart, opening the eyes of your mind so that you recognize it; and you will be given the strength to fulfill it. The grace of the Holy Spirit operates these things: without it, nothing is accomplished.</p>
      <p> 99.  If you have received the remission of all your sins, either through confession or through putting on the holy and angelic habit, this will be a great source of love, thanksgiving and humility for you. For not only have you been spared the countless punishments that you deserved, but you have been granted sonship, glory and the kingdom of heaven. Bear this in mind and continually meditate on it, taking care never to dishonor Him who honored you and has forgiven you ten</p>
      <p> [V4] 46</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> thousand sins; glorify and honor Him in all you do, so that in return He will glorify you even more - you whom He has honored above all visible creation and has called His true friend.</p>
      <p> 100.   As the soul is more precious than the body, so man endowed with intelligence excels the whole world. When you contemplate the grandeur of the created things with which the world is filled, do not think that they are more precious than you are; but keeping in mind the grace that has been given you, and aware of the value of your deiform soul, celebrate the God who has honored you above all visible things.</p>
      <p> 101.  Let us consider how we should glorify God. We cannot glorify Him in any way other than that in which He was glorified by the Son; for in the same way as the Son glorified the Father, the Son in turn was glorified by the Father. Let us, then, diligently use these same means to glorify Him who allows us to call Him 'our Father in heaven', so that we may be glorified by Him with the glory that the Son possesses with the Father prior to the world (cf John 17:5). These means are the cross, or death to the whole world, the afflictions, the trials and the other sufferings undergone by Christ. If we endure them with great patience, we imitate Christ's sufferings; and through them we glorify our Father and God, as His sons by grace and as coheirs of Christ.</p>
      <p> endure serenely the calamities and ravages with which both men and demons assail it. Bound by its attachment to human concerns, it is lacerated by the loss of material things, suffers when deprived of possessions, and is full of distress when its body is afflicted.</p>
      <p> 103.  A person who has delivered his soul from its ties with and desires for sensible things, and has bound it to God, will not only scorn property and possessions, accepting their loss painlessly, as if they belonged to others and were not his own; he will also endure bodily distress with joy and gratitude. In the words of St Paul, he sees the outward self perishing, but the inward self being renewed day by day (cf. 2 Cor. 4:16). Otherwise it is impossible joyfully to bear the afflictions permitted by God, for this requires perfect knowledge and spiritual wisdom. He who lacks these things walks at all times in the darkness of ignorance and hopelessness, totally incapable of beholding the light of patience and benediction.</p>
      <p> 104.   Anyone who thinks himself intelligent because of his scholarly [V4] 47</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> or scientific learning will never be granted insight into divine mysteries unless he first humbles himself and becomes a fool (cf 1 Cor. 3:18), discarding both his presumption and the knowledge that he has acquired. But if he does this and with unhesitating faith allows himself to be led by those wise in divine matters, he will enter with them into the city of the living God. Guided and illumined by the divine Spirit, he will see and learn what others cannot ever see or learn. He will then be taught by God (cf. John 6:45).</p>
      <p> 105.  Those taught by God will be regarded as fools by the disciples of such as are wise in the wisdom of this world. But in fact it is the worldly-wise that are fools, spouting an inane secular wisdom, the stupidity of which God has demonstrated (cf. 1 Cor. 1:20) and which Scripture condemns as material, unspiritual, devilish, filled with strife and malice (cf. Jas. 3:15). Since these people are blind to the divine light, they cannot see the marvels it contains; they regard as deluded those who dwell in that light and see and teach others about what is within it. On the contrary, it is they themselves that are deluded, not having tasted the ineffable blessings of God.</p>
      <p> 106.  Even now, living in our midst, there are people who are dispassionate and saintly, filled with divine light; who have so mortified whatever in them pertains to the earth (cf. Col. 3:5), freeing it from all impurity and impassioned desire, that not only do they themselves not think or act maliciously, but even when drawn in this direction by another they are unwavering in their dispassion. Those who accuse these saints of folly, and who do not believe them when in the wisdom of the Spirit they teach about divine matters, would have recognized them had they understood the sacred writings that are read and sung daily. For if they possessed a mature knowledge of the Holy Scriptures they would have believed in the blessings spoken of and bestowed on us by God. But because out of self-conceit and negligence they do not share in these blessings, in their unbelief they slander those who do share in them and who teach others about them.</p>
      <p> 107.  For this reason those filled with grace and perfect in spiritual knowledge and wisdom will meet and see people living in the world only in order to benefit them in some way through reminding them of God's commandments or by doing good; there is a chance that some will listen, understand, and be persuaded. For those</p>
      <p> not led by the Spirit of God walk in darkness and do not know where they are going [V4] 48</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> (of. John 12:35) or what are the obstacles that make them stumble. Yet perhaps one day they may recover from their presumption and accept the true teaching of the Holy Spirit; learning about the will of God in all its purity and integrity, they may repent, carry out this will and receive some share in spiritual grace. But if these holy people cannot in this way benefit those living in the world, they return to their cells, lamenting the hardness of heart they have encountered; and they pray day and night for the salvation of such as are still in darkness. To those who dwell constantly with God and are more than abundantly filled with every blessing, this is the only thing that causes sadness.</p>
      <p> 108.  What is the purpose of the Incarnation of the Divine Logos which is proclaimed throughout the Scriptures, about which we read and which yet we do not recognize? Surely it is that He has shared in what is ours so as to make us participants of what is His. For the Son of God became the Son of man in order to make us human beings sons of God, raising us up by grace to what He is by nature, giving us a new birth in the Holy Spirit and leading us directly into the kingdom of heaven. Or, rather. He gives us the grace to possess this kingdom within ourselves (cf. Luke 17:21), so that not merely do we hope to enter it but, being in full possession of it, we can affirm: 'Our life is hid with Christ m God' (Col. 3:3).</p>
      <p> 109.  Baptism does not take away our free will or freedom of choice, but gives us the freedom no longer to be tyrannized by the devil unless we choose to be. After baptism it is in our power either to persist willingly in the practice of the commandments of Christ, into whom we were baptized, and to advance in the path of His ordinances, or to deviate from this straight way and to fall again into the hands of our enemy, the devil.</p>
      <p> 110.  Whoever after baptism deliberately submits to the will of the devil and carries out his wishes, estranges himself - to adapt David's words - from the holy womb of baptism (cf. Ps. 58:3). None of us can be estranged or alienated from the nature with which we are created. We are created good by God - for God creates nothing evil -and we remain unchanging in our nature and essence as created. But we do what we choose and want, whether good or bad, of our own free will. Just as a knife does not change its nature, but remains iron whether used for good or for evil, so we, as has been said, act and do what we want without departing from our own nature.</p>
      <p> [V4] 49</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> in. To be merciful to just one person will not save you, but to scorn just one person will send you to the fire (cf.Matt.18:10). The words, 'I was hungry' and 'I was thirsty' (Matt. 25:35), were spoken with reference not merely to a single occasion or to a single day, but to the whole of our life. Thus our Lord and God has declared that He accepts from His servants food, drink, clothing and so on, not once only but always and in all things.</p>
      <p> 112.  Even though we may have been charitable to a hundred people, if there were others from whom we turned away when they asked for food and drink and we could have given it to them, we will be judged by Christ as having refused Him nourishment. For Christ, whom we nourish in the humblest of people, is in all those to whom we refused our charity.</p>
      <p> 113.   He who today gives to all everything they need and tomorrow, though still in the position to act in a similar way, neglects some of his fellow beings and allows them to perish of hunger, thirst or cold, has scorned and allowed to die Him who said, 'Inasmuch as you have done it to the least of these My kindred, you have done it to Me' (Matt. 25:40).</p>
      <p> 114.   Christ takes on the appearance of each of the poor and assimilates Himself to all of them so that no one who believes in Him will be arrogant towards his fellow being. On the contrary, he will look on his fellow being and his neighbor as his God, regarding himself as least of all in comparison just as much with his neighbor as with his Creator, honoring his neighbor as if he were his Creator, and exhausting his all in his service, just as Christ our God poured out His blood for our salvation.</p>
      <p> 115.  We who have been commanded to regard our neighbor as ourself (cf. Lev. 19:18; Luke 10:27) should do so not for one day only, but for our whole life. Similarly, we who have been told to give to all who ask (cf. Matt. 5:42) are told to do this for our whole life. And if we would like others to do good to us, we should ourselves act in the same way towards them (cf. Matt. 7:12).</p>
      <p> 116.  Whoever regards his neighbor as himself cannot bear to possess more than his neighbor. On the other hand, if he has more and does not give unstintingly until he himself becomes as poor as his neighbor, he fails to fulfill the Lord's commandment. And if someone wishes to give to all who ask, but rejects one of them while he still has a penny or a scrap of bread, or if he does not act towards his neighbor</p>
      <p> [V4] 50</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> as he would like other people to act towards him, he too is failing to fulfill the Lord's commandment. Similarly if you provide for even the humblest of the poor, and give him drink, and clothe him, and so on, but ignore a single person whom you know to be hungry and thirsty, you will be regarded as having ignored Christ our God when He was hungry and thirsty.</p>
      <p> 117.   This may seem extremely severe, and you may well say to yourself: 'Who can do all this? Who can care and provide for everyone, and not ignore anyone?' But let us listen to what St Paul explicitly states: 'For the love of Christ impels us to pronounce this judgment: that, since one has died for all, therefore all have died' (2 Cor. 5:14).</p>
      <p> 118.  Just as the more comprehensive commandments contain within themselves all the more particular commandments, so the more comprehensive virtues contain in themselves the more particular virtues. For he who sells what he has and distributes it to the poor (cf. Matt. 19:21), and who once and for all becomes poor himself, has fulfilled at once all the more particular commandments: he no longer has to give alms to the person who asks him for them, nor does he have to-refrain from rejecting the man who wishes to borrow from him (cf. Matt. 5:42). So, too, someone who prays continuously (cf. 1 Thess. 5:17) has in this act included everything and is no longer obliged</p>
      <p> to praise the Lord seven times a day (of. Ps. 119:164), or in the evening, in the morning, and at noonday (of. Ps. 55:17): he has already done all that we do by way of prayer and psalmody according to the regulations and at specific times and hours. Similarly, he who has acquired consciously within himself the Teacher of spiritual knowledge (cf. Ps. 94:10) has gone through all Scripture, has gained all that is to be gained from reading, and will no longer have need to resort to books. How is this? The person who is in communion with Him who inspired those who wrote the Divine Scriptures, and is initiated by Him into the undivulged secrets of the hidden mysteries, will himself be an inspired book to others - a book containing old and new mysteries and written by the hand of God; for he has accomplished all things and in God, the principle of perfection, he rests from all his labors.</p>
      <p> 119.  Emission of semen in sleep may be produced by many factors. It may be due to gluttony, or self-esteem, or the envy of the demons. It may occur after long vigils when the body is sluggish and ready for sleep. It may happen because of the fear that it may happen, especially</p>
      <p> [V4] 51</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> if one is a priest due to celebrate the Liturgy, or intends to receive holy communion: filled with anxious thoughts that this might happen, one falls asleep only to have it happen. This, too, is brought about by the envy of the demons. Or it may be that after seeing a lovely face during the day, one then recalls it mentally, and falls asleep full of unchaste thoughts which one fails to repel because of one's sluggishness: thus one lapses while asleep, or even while lying awake in bed. Or certain individuals - negligent, as 1 see it - may sit and talk, perhaps impassionately, perhaps not, about things involving the passions; then, when they go to bed, they turn those things over in their minds, drop off to sleep while thinking about them, and come under their spell during sleep. It may even happen during the conversation itself, one person being perverted by another. We should therefore always be attentive to ourselves and reflect on the prophet's words: '1 have set the Lord always before me, because He is at my right hand, so that 1 shall not be shaken' (Ps. 16:8); and we should not listen to such talk. Often even those engrossed in prayer are physically aroused, as 1 have stated in the text on prayer.</p>
      <p> 120.  Brother, at the beginning of your renunciation of the world, try hard to implant in yourself noble virtues, so that you become useful to the community and so that the Lord may finally exalt you. Do not try to be familiar with the abbot, as we have already said elsewhere, or request any honor from him. Do not seek friendship with the senior members of the community, and do not hang about their cells; for if you do, not only will the passion of self-esteem begin to take root in you, but you will be disliked by the superior. Why this is so will be clear if you think about it. Sit peacefully in your cell, whatever it is like. If someone wants to contact you, do not spurn him on the grounds that he disturbs your devotions. Provided that you meet him with the consent of your spiritual father, you will come to no harm, even if the visitor has been sent to you by the enemy. But if you see that no good comes from the meeting, you should follow the path that is of profit to you.</p>
      <p> 121.  At all times you should fear God, and every day you should examine yourself to see what good things you have done and what bad things. And you should forget what was good, lest you succumb to the passion of self-esteem. But where what was bad is concerned you should weep, confess, and pray intensely. This self-examination should</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> take place as follows: when the day has ended and evening has come, ask yourself how, with God's help, you have passed the day. Did you judge anyone, speak harshly of anyone, or offend anyone? Did you look nnpassionately at anyone, or did you disobey your superior with regard to your duties and neglect them? Did you become angry with anyone, or occupy your mind with useless things while in church? Or, overcome by lethargy, did you leave church or depart from your rule of prayer? When you see that you are guiltless on all counts - which is impossible, for 'no one is free from stain, not even for a single day of his life' (cf. Job 14:4-5. LXX), and 'who will boast that his heart is pure?' (cf. Prov. 20:9) - then cry out to God, full of tears: 'Lord, forgive me all my sins, in thought or act, conscious or unwitting.' For we offend in many ways, and do not know it.</p>
      <p> 122.  Each day you should reveal all your thoughts to your spiritual father; and you should accept with complete confidence what he says to you, as if it came from the mouth of God. Do not speak of any of this to anyone else, saying: 'When I asked my spiritual father such and such a thing, he said this or that; was that good counsel or not? And what should I do to heal myself?' Words like these display lack of trust in your spiritual father and injure the soul. Mostly they occur in the case of beginners.</p>
      <p> 123.  You should look on all who are in the monastery as saints and regard only yourself as a sinner and as the least of all, thinking that on that day all will be saved and you alone will be punished. And when you are in church reflecting about these things, weep bitter tears of compunction, taking no account of those who will be shocked by this or mock such behavior. But if you see that as a result of this you are slipping into self-esteem, leave the church and weep in secret, returning as soon as you can to your place. This is particularly valuable in the case of beginners, especially during the six psalms, the psalter, the readings, and the Divine Liturgy. Be careful not to condemn anyone, but keep it in mind that all who see your distress will think that you are a great sinner and will pray for your salvation. If you think of this at all times and carry it out constantly, you will be greatly helped, attracting to yourself God's grace and becoming a participant in His divine blessings.</p>
      <p> [V4] 53</p>

      <p> 124.  Do not visit the cell of anyone except the abbot, and this rarely. Even if you want to ask the abbot about some thought, do this in church. After the service return at once to your cell; from there go to carry out your duties. After compline, prostrate yourself before the abbot's door, ask for his prayers, and then, head down, hurry silently back to your cell. For it is better to repeat the Tnsagion prayer once with attention before going to bed than to pass a four-hour vigil in idle talk. Where there are compunction and spiritual grief, there is also divine illumination; when this is present in you, listlessness and sickness are dispelled.</p>
      <p> 125.  Do not permit yourself to feel special love for anyone, in particular for a novice, even if his way of life</p>
      <p> seems excellent, and much more so if it is suspect. Generally such love, even if initially spiritual, changes into an impassioned love, and results in useless afflictions. This tends to happen especially to those engaged in spiritual warfare, as one may learn through humility and constant prayer. This is not the right occasion for me to speak about these matters in detail, but he who has understanding will understand.</p>
      <p> 126.   Be a stranger to every brother in the monastery - and even more to all whom you know in the world. Love everyone equally and look on all those devoutly engaged in spiritual warfare as saints. For those who are negligent, as we ourselves are, we must pray intensely; but nevertheless, as I said above, we should regard all as saints, and should strive through inward grief to be purified of our passions, so that, illumined by grace, we may look on all as equals and attain the blessing of those who are pure in heart (cf Matt. 5:8).</p>
      <p> 127.   Brother, regard perfect withdrawal from the world first as the complete mortification of your own will; in the second place regard it as detachment from and abjuration of parents, family and friends.</p>
      <p> 128.  In the third place you must divest yourself of all that belongs to you and give it to the poor, in accordance with the words, 'Sell all you have and give it to the poor' (Matt. 19:21). Then you must forget all with whom you enjoyed a particular relationship of love, whether physical or spiritual.</p>
      <p> 129.  You must confess all the secrets of your heart, all that you have done from your infancy until this very hour, to your spiritual father or to the abbot as if to God himself, the diviner of hearts and</p>
      <p> [V4] 54</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> minds. Do this in the knowledge that John baptized with the baptism of repentance and that all came to him confessing their sins (cf Matt. 3:6). As a result of this your soul will experience great joy and your conscience will find relief, in accordance with the words of the Prophet: 'First declare your sins, so that you may be set free' (cf. Isa. 43:26).</p>
      <p> 130.  Be fully persuaded that after your entry into the monastery your parents and all your friends are dead; and regard solely God and the abbot as your father and mother. Never ask anything of parents or friends on account of some bodily need. If in their concern they send you something, accept it and be grateful for their solicitude, but give whatever they send to the guest-house or to the hospital. Do this with humility; for it is not a sublime but an insignificant act.</p>
      <p> 131.  Do everything good with humility, keeping in mind Him who said, 'When you have done everything, say, "We are useless servants; we have only done what was our duty" ' (Luke 17:10).</p>
      <p> 132.   Take care never to receive communion while you have anything against anyone, even if this is only a hostile thought. Not until you have brought about reconciliation through repentance should you communicate. But you will learn this, too, through prayer.</p>
      <p> 133.  You should be ready each day to receive all kinds of afflictions, regarding them as your release from many sins; and you should thank God for them. Through them you may acquire a close and unimpeachable communion with God, in accordance with St Paul's words: 'Afflictions produce patient endurance; patient endurance, strength of</p>
      <p> character; and strength of character, hope; and hope does not disappoint' (Rom. 5:3-5). For the things that 'the eye has not seen, and the ear has not heard, and man's heart has not grasped' (1 Cor. 2:9) - these things belong, according to the infaUible promise, to those who, with the help of God's grace, patiently endure affliction. Without God's grace we can of course do nothing.</p>
      <p> 134.   Have nothing material in your cell, not even a needle, except for a rush mat, your sheepskin, your cloak, and whatever else you wear. If possible, do not have a stool there. There is much to be said on this matter; but let him who has understanding understand.</p>
      <p> 135.  Again, do not ask the abbot for any appurtenances other than those prescribed; and take these only when he calls you and himself gives them to you. Resist any thought of exchanging them for others. Accept them as they are with thanksgiving, as if they had been given by</p>
      <p> [V4] 55</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> God, and manage with them. It is not permitted to buy others. You should wash your outer garment twice a year if it becomes dirty; and, like some unknown beggar, you should ask your brother in all humility for something to wear until it has been washed and dried in the sun. Then you should return what you have borrowed with thanks. You should do the same with your cloak and any other clothing.</p>
      <p> 136.  Perform the various duties assigned to you as well as you can; in your cell persevere in prayer with compunction, attentiveness and constant tears. You should not think that because you have worked exceptionally hard today you should reduce your prayer on account of bodily exhaustion. For however greatly you exert yourself in performing your duties, you should be aware that you have lost something of great value if you deprive yourself of prayer. For this is in fact the case.</p>
      <p> 137.   You should arrive first at the church services, especially matins and the Liturgy, and leave last, unless forced to do otherwise.</p>
      <p> 138.  You should be completely obedient to your abbot, from whom you received the tonsure, and should fulfill his orders uncritically until your death, even if they seem impossible to you. In this way you will imitate Him who was obedient 'to the point of death, even death on the cross' (Phil. 2:8). You should obey in everything not only the abbot, but all the brotherhood, and whoever is in charge of the various tasks that have to be done; and if you are told to do something beyond your power, make a prostration and ask forgiveness. Should this be refused, remember that 'the kingdom of heaven is entered forcibly, and those who force themselves take possession of it' (Matt. 11: 12); and apply force to yourself.</p>
      <p> 139.  Whoever with a contrite heart prostrates himself before the entire brotherhood as a person of no account, utterly inconspicuous, a nonentity, and who lives in this way throughout his life, will receive, I declare, the gift of insight, and will foretell many things about the future with the help of God's grace. Such a person will also grieve for the faults of others; moreover, he will be undistracted by attachment to material things, since the intensity of his love for what is divine and spiritual will not permit him to stumble because of them. There is nothing marvelous about foretelling things of the future: often, indeed, it is prompted by the demons, as he who has understanding will</p>
      <p> understand. But if a person begins to hear confessions, he may perhaps be deprived of these gifts, since he wiU then be busied with the examination of other people's thoughts. If, on the other hand, out of</p>
      <p> [V4] 56</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> great humihty he stops hearing confessions and giving counsel, he may again recover his previous gift of insight But God atone has knowledge of these things; as for myself, constrained by fear I dare not speak of them.</p>
      <p> 140. You should always direct your intellect towards God, whether asleep or awake, eating or talking, engaged in your handiwork Or in any other activity. Thus you will fulfill the saying of the prophet, 'I have set the Lord always before me' (Ps. 16:8). Reckon yourself a greater sinner than anyone else. For if you persist in this state of recollectedness, illumination will enter your mind like a ray of light. And the more you aspire to such illumination, attentive and undistracted, striving and tearful, the more clearly it will shine. When it shines, it is loved; and when it is loved, it purifies; and as it purifies, it makes one godlike, enlightening one and teaching one to distinguish good from evil. But, my brother, much hard work is needed, and God's help, before this radiance indwells totally in your soul and illumines it as the moon illumines the darkness of the night. You must also pay attention to the thoughts of arrogance and presumption which attack you, and not condemn anyone when you see him doing something wrong. For when the demons see the soul freed from passions and temptations through the indwelling of grace and the resulting state of peace, they attack it through such thoughts. But help comes from God. Let your inward grief be continuous and your tears unquenchable. Yet take care not to harm yourself because of your great joy and compunction: recognize that they are the result not of your own labor but of God's grace. Otherwise they may be taken from you and, when you urgently seek them again in prayer, you will not be able to recover them. You will then know what a gift it is that you have lost. May we never, 0 Lord, be deprived of Thy grace.</p>
      <p> Yet if this does happen to you, my brother, cast your weakness before the Lord and, standing up, stretch forth your hands and pray, saying, 'Lord, have mercy on me a sinner, abject and weak as I am; and grant me Thy grace, not allowing me to be tested beyond my capacity. See, Lord, to what despondency and bad thoughts my sins have led me. Lord, even if I wish to I cannot measure the loss of Thy benediction,' brought about by the demons and my own presumption. I know that the demons range themselves against those who zealously fulfill Thy will. But since I daily do what they want, how is it that I am afflicted by them? I am tried constantly by my own sins. Yet now. Lord, if it is Thy</p>
      <p> [V4] 57</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> will and to my benefit, let Thy grace enter Thy servant once again, so that, aware of it, I may rejoice with tears and compunction, illumined by its eternal radiance. Guard me from unclean thoughts, from everything evil, from the sins I commit daily in word or act, consciously or unwittingly. May I be given the confidence to call upon Thee freely, 0</p>
      <p> Lord, from amidst all the afflictions that I suffer daily at the hands of men and demons; and, cutting off my own will, may I be mindful of the blessings stored up for those that love Thee. For Thou hast said. Lord, that he who asks receives, that he who seeks finds, and that the door will be opened to whoever knocks'(cf Matt. 7 : 8). In addition to saying these and other things that God puts into your mind, persevere in prayer, not allowing yourself to grow slack through listlessness. And God in His love will not abandon you.</p>
      <p> 141.  Persevere until the end in the cell initially allotted to you by your superior. If you are troubled because of its age or dilapidation, make a prostration before your superior and humbly mention the matter to him. If he hears you sympathetically, rejoice; if not, give thanks anyway, remembering our Lord who had nowhere to lay His head (cf. Matt. 8:20). For if you disturb the superior about this a second time, then a third and fourth time, insolence will result, then lack of trust, and finally disdain. So if you want to lead a quiet and peaceful life, do not ask your superior for any bodily comfort. For it was not to this that you dedicated yourself when originally making your monastic vows; but you consented to be despised and scorned by all, in accordance with our Lord's commandment, and to endure manfully. If you want to maintain your trust in and love for your superior, and to look on him as a saint, make sure of these three things: that you do not ask him for any comfort; that you do not take any liberties when speaking with him; and that you do not keep visiting him, as some do, on the grounds that he helps them. This is not perseverance, but human failing. On the other hand, I do not condemn the practice of not hiding from him any distractive thought that comes into your mind; for if you maintain this practice you will pass over the sea of life smoothly and will regard your spiritual father, whatever he may be like, as a saint. Should you approach him in church in order to question him about a distractive thought, but find that someone else has anticipated you for the same purpose, or for some other reason, and that you are therefore ignored for a short while, do not take it amiss or think anything hostile; stand by</p>
      <p> [V4] 58</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> yourself with hands folded until the other person has finished and you are called forward. The fathers often act in this way, perhaps deliberately, testing us and releasing us from sins we have committed.</p>
      <p> 142.  You should observe the great Lenten fast by eating every third day (not counting Saturdays and Sundays), unless there is a major feast. During the other two main fasts - before Christmas and before the Feast of the Dormition - you should eat every other day. On the remaining days of the year you should eat once only, except on Saturday and Sunday and on feast days; but do not eat to repletion.</p>
      <p> 143.   Strive to become for the whole community a good example of every virtue: of humility, gentleness, active compassion, obedience even in the least of things, freedom from anger, detachment, unpossessiveness and compunction, guilelessness and unmquisitiveness, of simplicity and estrangement from the world. Visit the sick, console the distressed, and do not make your longing for prayer a pretext for turning away from anyone who asks for your help; for love is greater than prayer. Show sympathy towards all, do not be arrogant or over-familiar, do not find fault with others, or ask for anything from the abbot or from those in charge of various monastic tasks; be respectful towards all priests, attentive in prayer, frank and loving towards everyone; and do not ransack the Scriptures for the sake of glory. Prayer accompanied by tears and illumination given by grace will teach you how to</p>
      <p> accomplish all this.</p>
      <p> Whoever it may be who seeks your assistance and asks for your guidance, with great humility and self-effacement give advice as God's grace inspires you about the different forms of holy action, using your own life as the model but referring to it as though it were that of someone else. And do not reject anyone who seeks your help with regard to some distractive thought, but listen to his sins, whatever they may be, weeping and praying for him; for this, too, is a sign of love and perfect compassion. Do not repel someone who comes to you on the grounds that you might be harmed by hearing what he has to say: with the help of God's grace, you will not be harmed in any way. So that no one else may be scandalized, you should speak in some secluded place. Being human, you may be attacked by some distractive thought; but if God's grace is present in you, such a thing will not happen to you. In any case, we are</p>
      <p> [V4] 59</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> taught to seek not our own good but that of others, so that they may be saved (cf 1 Cor. 10:24, 33).</p>
      <p> As we have already said, you should keep your life free from worldly concerns and possessions. You may recognize that grace is active within you when you truly feel that you are a greater shmer than all other men. How this happens, not I, but only God can say.</p>
      <p> 144.  When keeping vigil you should read for two hours, pray for two hours with tears and compunction, go through whatever you choose of your own rule of prayer, and repeat, if you wish, the twelve psalms. Psalm 119, and the prayer of St Eustratios. Do this when the nights are long. When they are shorter, abbreviate the sequence of prayers and readings in accordance with the strength given you by God. For without Him nothing good is accomplished: as the prophet says, 'The steps of a man are guided by the Lord' (Ps. 37:23. LXX). And our Savior Himself has said, 'Without Me you can do nothing" (John 15:5).</p>
      <p> Never go to communion without tears.</p>
      <p> 145.  You should eat what is put in front of you, no matter what it is; and take wine with uncomplaining self-restraint. If because of sickness you are having your meals by yourself, eat raw vegetables with olives. But if one of the brethren should send you something to eat, receive it with humility and thanks, as if you were a guest, and eat some of it, whatever it may be, sending what is left over to another brother, poor and pious. Should someone invite you to a meal, partake of all that is put in front of you, but eat only a little, maintaining your self-control in accordance with the commandment. Then, having stood up and bowed before him as though you were destitute and a stranger, thank him. Saying, 'May God give you your reward, holy father.' Be careful to say nothing else, even though it might possibly be of help.</p>
      <p> 146.   If some brother, badly upset by the abbot, or the steward, or by someone else, should come to you, encourage him in this way:</p>
      <p> 'Believe me, brother, this has happened in order to test you; for the same thing has happened to me in various ways, and because of my</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> faint-heartedness I was grieved. But once I realized that these things occur in order to test us, I have endured them gratefully. You should do the same now, and be glad for such trials.' Even if he then begins to abuse you, still do not turn away from him, but console him in whatever way God's grace enables you to do so. We have to distinguish between many different situations. According to your knowledge of your brother's state and his thoughts, talk to him, and do not let him go away unhealed.</p>
      <p> 147.  If one of the brethren falls ill and you visit him only after some time, first send him a message: 'Holy father, I learnt about your illness only today, and I ask your forgiveness.' Then go and see him; and, after making a prostration and receiving his blessing, say to him: 'How has God helped you, holy father?' Then, sitting down with your hands folded, be silent. Even if there are others visiting him at the same time, be careful not to say anything either about the Scriptures or about his health, especially when not asked, so that you will not be troubled afterwards. For this is what happens generally to the more simple brethren.</p>
      <p> 148.  If you are having a meal with your brethren, eat unhesitatingly of what is presented to you, whatever it may be. If, however, you have been told not to eat fish or some other food, and it is offered to you, should the person who gave you the order be close at hand, go to him and request him to let you partake; but should he not be present, or if you know that he would not give his permission, and at the same time you do not wish to offend your hosts, tell him what you have done after you have eaten, and ask his forgiveness. If you are unwilling to do either of these things, it is better for you not to visit your brethren. For in this way you will be the gainer in two respects: you will escape the demon of self-esteem, and at the same time spare them offence and distress. If the foods offered to you are on the rich side, keep to your rule; yet even in this case it is better to take a little of everything. In short, when you are invited somewhere, apply the principle laid down by St Paul: 'Eat all that is set before you without raising questions of conscience' (cf. i Cor. 10:25).</p>
      <p> 149.  If one of the brethren knocks on your door while you are praying in your cell, open it for him and sit down and talk with him humbly, provided he proposes a topic of conversation that has some positive purpose. If he is distraught, do what you can, through word or act, to rally him. But when he has gone, close your door and take up</p>
      <p> [V4] 61</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> your prayer again, and complete it. To comfort those who visit you is a form of reconciliation. But you should not act in this way with regard to non-monks; in their case you should complete your prayer and then speak with them.</p>
      <p> 150.  If, while you are praying, you feel frightened, or hear some noise, or if a light shines around you, or something else happens, do not be troubled, but concentrate all the more fully on your prayer. Demonic disturbances, alarms and excursions occur so that you will lose heart and give up your prayer; then, if this happens</p>
      <p> regularly, you will fall into the demons' power. But if as you pray another light, beyond description, appears to you, and your soul is filled with joy, and you feel a desire for higher things, and tears of compunction flow, know that this is a divine visitation and succor. Should this state continue for a long time, recapture your intellect in case something more happens to you because of the anguish of your tears, and submit it to some physical activity, thereby humbling yourself. If it is your enemies that are trying to frighten you, take care not to abandon your prayer. Be as the child who, frightened by some hobgoblin, dispels his terror by flying into the arms of his mother or father: resort to God through prayer and you will find that you escape the fear which the demons provoke.</p>
      <p> 151.  If, while you are sitting in your cell, one of the brothers comes to you and asks about carnal warfare, do not turn him away. But with compunction help him, using what God's grace has given you and what you have yourself learnt through your own experience; and then dismiss him. As he leaves, however, make a prostration before him and say, 'Believe me, brother, I have hope that through God's love this war you wage will end; only do not give in or relax.' When he has gone, stand up, recall his struggle and, lifting your hands with tears towards God, pray with all your heart for your brother, saying, '0 Lord God, who do not desire the death of a sinner, act as You know how and as will benefit this brother.' And God, who knows your brother's faith in you, and your compassion bom of love, and the genuineness of your prayer on his behalf, will diminish this warfare for him.</p>
      <p> 152.  All those things, brother, help you to acquire compunction. They should be carried out with a contrite heart, patience, and thanksgiving. They will cause you to shed tears, cleansing you of your passions, and will bring you to the kingdom of heaven. 'For the kingdom of heaven is entered forcibly, and those who force themselves</p>
      <p> [V4] 62</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> take possession of it' (Matt. 11:12). If you can accomplish these things you will leave your former way of life completely behind, and may even be freed from the attacks of distractive thoughts. For darkness gives way to light, and a shadow to the sun. But should someone at the start of the spiritual path neglect these things, growing sluggish in thought and full of curiosity, he will be deprived of grace. Then, falling a victim to evil passions, he will come to know his own weakness and be filled with fear. Yet the person who successfully accomplishes these things should realize that this is the result not of his own efforts but of God's grace. He should purify himself first, in accordance with the saying, 'First purify yourself and then speak to Him who is pure.' For he who through many tears has purified his intellect and has received the illumination of the divine light - light that would grow no less even if everyone received it - will dwell spiritually in the age to come.</p>
      <p> 153.  St Symeon the New Theologian was once asked what a priest ought to be like, and he replied as follows:</p>
      <p> 'I am not worthy to be a priest; but I know very well what someone who is to celebrate the sacred mysteries of God should be like. In the first place, he should be chaste, not only in body but also in soul, and he should be free of all sin. Secondly, he should be humble both in his external manner and in the inner State of his soul. Then, when he stands before the holy altar, while gazing with his physical eyes on the holy gifts, spiritually - and with total certainty - he should perceive the Godhead. Moreover, his heart should be consciously aware of Him who is invisibly present and dwelling in the gifts, so that he may offer the petitions with confidence; and when, like a friend speaking to a friend, he says, 'Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name' (Matt. 6:9), the way in which</p>
      <p> he recites the prayer will show that he has dwelling within him the true Son of God, together with the Father and the Holy Spirit. I have seen such priests. Forgive me, fathers and brethren.'</p>
      <p> He also spoke the following words, as if about someone else, thereby concealing himself so as to avoid human adulation, even though because of his love for others he felt at the same time compelled to reveal himself:</p>
      <p> 'A certain priest-monk, who had full confidence in me as his friend, once told me this: "I have never celebrated the Liturgy without seeing the Holy Spirit, just as I saw Him come upon me when I was ordained</p>
      <p> [V4] 63</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> and the metropolitan said the prayer while the service-book rested on my head." When I asked him how he saw it at that time, and in what form, he said: "Undifferentiated and without form, except as light. At first I was astonished, beholding what I had never beheld before; and as I was asking myself what it might be, the light said to me, its voice heard only by the intellect: 'Thus have I appeared to all the prophets and apostles, and to those who are now the saints and the elect of God; for I am the Holy Spirit of God.' " To Him be glory and power through all the ages. Amen.'</p>
      <p> [V4] 64, [V4] 65, [V4] 66</p>
      <p> [V4] 67</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian The Three Methods of Prayer</p>
      <p> There are three methods of prayer and attentiveness, by means of which the soul is either uplifted or cast down. Whoever employs these methods at the right time is uplifted, but whoever employs them foolishly and at the wrong time is cast down. Vigilance and prayer should be as closely linked together as the body to the soul, for the one cannot stand without the other. Vigilance first goes on ahead like a scout and engages sin in combat. Prayer then follows afterwards, and instantly destroys and exterminates all the evil thoughts with which vigilance has already been battling, for attentiveness alone cannot exterminate them. This, then, is the gate of life and death. If by means of vigilance we keep prayer pure, we make progress; but if we leave prayer unguarded and permit it to be defiled, our efforts are null and void.</p>
      <p> Since, then, as we said, there are three methods of attentiveness and prayer, we should explain the distinctive features of each, so that he who aspires to attain life and wishes to set to work may with firm assurance select what suits him best; otherwise through ignorance he may choose what is worse and forfeit what is better.</p>
      <p> The First Method of Prayer</p>
      <p> The distinctive features of the first method of prayer are these. When a person stands at prayer, he raises hands, eyes and intellect heavenwards, and fills his intellect with divine thoughts, with images of celestial beauty, of the angelic hosts, of the abodes of the righteous. In brief, at the time of prayer he assembles in his intellect all that he has</p>
      <p> [V4] 68</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian The Three Methods of Prayer</p>
      <p> heard from Holy Scripture and so rouses his soul to divine longing as he gazes towards heaven, and sometimes he sheds tears. But when someone prays in this way, without him realizing it his heart grows proud and exalted, and he regards what is happening to him as the effect of divine grace and entreats God to allow him always to be engaged in this activity. Such assumptions, however, are signs of delusion, because the good is not good when it is not done in the right way.</p>
      <p> If, then, such a person is pursuing a life of stillness and seclusion, he will almost inevitably become deranged. And even if this does not happen to him, it will be impossible for him to attain a state of holiness or dispassion. Those who adopt this method of prayer have also been deluded into thinking that they see lights with their bodily eyes, smell sweet scents, hear voices, and so on. Some have become completely possessed by demons and wander from place to place in their madness. Others fail to recognize the devil when he transforms himself into an angel of light (cf. 2 Cor. 11:14); and, putting their trust in him, they continue in an incorrigible state of delusion until their death, refusing to accept the counsel of anyone else. Still others, incited by the devil, have committed suicide, throwing themselves over a precipice or hanging themselves.</p>
      <p> Indeed, who can describe all the various forms of deception employed by the devil? Yet from what we have said any sane person can understand the kind of harm that may result from this first method of attentiveness. Even if someone who has adopted this method may perhaps avoid the evils we have mentioned because he lives in a community - for it is solitaries who are especially subject to them - none the less he will pass his entire life without making any progress.</p>
      <p> The Second Method of Prayer</p>
      <p> The second form of prayer is this. A person withdraws his intellect from sensory things and concentrates it in himself, guards his senses, and collects all his thoughts; and he advances oblivious of the vanities of this world. Sometimes he examines his thoughts, sometimes pays</p>
      <p> [V4] 69</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian The Three Methods of Prayer</p>
      <p> attention to the words of the prayer he is addressing to God, and sometimes drags back his thoughts when they have</p>
      <p> been taken captive; and when he is overcome by passion he forcefuUy strives to recover himself.</p>
      <p> One who struggles in this way, however, can never be at peace or win the crown of victory. He is like a person fighting at night: he hears the voices of his enemies and is wounded by them, but he cannot see clearly who they are, where they come from, and how and for what purpose they assail him. Such is the damage done to him because of the darkness in his intellect. Fighting in this manner, he cannot ever escape his noetic enemies, but is worn out by them. For all his efforts he gains nothing. Falsely imagining that he is concentrated and attentive, he falls victim unawares to self-esteem. Dominated and mocked by it, he despises and criticizes others for their lack of attentiveness. Imagining that he is capable of becoming the shepherd of sheep, he is like the blind man who undertakes to lead the blind (cf Matt. 15:14).</p>
      <p> Such are the characteristics of the second method of prayer, and every one striving after salvation can see what harm it does. Yet this second method is better than the first, just as a moonlit night is better than a night that is pitch-dark and starless.</p>
      <p> The Third Method of Prayer</p>
      <p> Let us now begin to speak about the third method of prayer, which is truly astonishing and hard to explain. For those ignorant of it, it is not only difficult to understand but virtually incredible, and there are very few to be found who practice it. It seems to me that it has deserted us along with the virtue of obedience. For it is the love of obedience that delivers us from entanglement with this evil world, rendering us free from anxiety and impassioned craving. It makes us wholehearted and unflagging in pursuit of our aim - provided, of course, that we find an unerring guide. For if through obedience you make yourself dead to every worldly and bodily attachment, how can anything transient enslave your intellect? If you entrust all the care of your soul and body to God and to your spiritual father, no longer living for yourself or desiring the good opinion of others, what anxiety can distract 'you?</p>
      <p> [V4] 70</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian The Three Methods of Prayer</p>
      <p> This third method, then, destroys the invisible wiles of the demons, with which as with ropes they seek to drag down the intellect into all manner of devious droughts. Set at liberty, the intellect wages war with its full strength, scrutinizing the thoughts insinuated by the enemy and with masterful dexterity expelling them, while the heart in its purity offers prayers to God. This is the beginning of a life of true seclusion, and those who fail to make such a beginning exhaust themselves in vain.</p>
      <p> The starting-point of this third method of prayer is not to gaze upwards, to raise one's hands aloft, to concentrate one's thoughts and to call down help from heaven. These, as we said, are the marks of the first form of delusion. Nor does it begin, as the second method does, by keeping guard over the senses with the intellect, while failing to observe the enemies who attack from within. In such a case, a person is struck by the demons instead of striking them; when wounded he is unaware of it; taken captive, he cannot retaliate against his captors. His enemies constantly attack him, from behind and even face to face, and fill him with self-esteem and arrogance.</p>
      <p> If you desire to embark on this light-giving and joyful task, begin as follows. You must first practice exact</p>
      <p> obedience, as described above, and so act always with a pure conscience; for without obedience it is impossible for your conscience to be pure. And you must keep your conscience pure in three respects: first, with respect to God; second, with respect to your spiritual father; and third, with respect to other people and to material things. With respect to God you must keep your conscience pure by refraining from doing anything that conflicts with the worship due to Him. With respect to your spiritual father do everything he tells you to do, neither more nor less, and be guided by his purpose and will. With respect to other people, you must keep your conscience pure by not doing to them anything that you hate (cf. Tobit 4:15) and that you do not want them to do to you. With respect to material things, you must take care not to misuse them, whether food, drink or clothing. In brief, do everything as if you were in the presence of God, so that your conscience does not rebuke you in any way.</p>
      <p> Having cleared the ground and indicated in a preliminary way the true character of attentiveness, let us now speak clearly and concisely about its characteristics. True and unerring attentiveness and prayer mean that the intellect keeps watch over the heart while it prays; it</p>
      <p> [V4] 71</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian The Three Methods of Prayer</p>
      <p> should always be on patrol within the heart, and from within - from the depths of the heart - it should offer up its prayers to God. Once it has tasted within the heart that the Lord is bountiful (cf. Ps. 34:8. LXX), then the intellect will have no desire to leave the heart, and it will repeat the words of the Apostle Peter, 'It is good for us to be here' (Matt. 17:4). It will keep watch always within the heart, repulsing and expelling all thoughts sown there by the enemy. To those who have no knowledge of this practice it appears extremely harsh and arduous; and indeed it is oppressive and laborious, not only to the uninitiated, but also to those who, although genuinely experienced, have not yet felt the delight to be found in the depths of the heart. But those who have savored this delight proclaim with St Paul, 'Who will separate us from the love of Christ?' (Rom. 8:35).</p>
      <p> Our holy fathers hearkened to the Lord's words, 'Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, unchastity, thefts, perjuries, blasphemies; these are the things that defile a man' (Matt. 15:19-20); and they also hearkened to Him when He enjoins us to cleanse the inside of the cup so that the outside may also be clean (cf. Matt. 23:26). Hence they abandoned all other forms of spiritual labor and concentrated wholly on this one task of guarding the heart, convinced that through this practice they would also possess every other virtue, whereas without it no virtue could be firmly established. Some of the fathers have called this practice stillness of the heart, others attentiveness, others the guarding of the heart, others watchfulness and rebuttal, and others again the investigation of thoughts and the guarding of the intellect. But all of them alike worked the earth of their own heart, and in this way they were fed on the divine manna (cf. Exod. 16:15).</p>
      <p> Ecclesiastes is referring to this when he says, 'Rejoice, 0 young man, in your youth; and walk in the ways of your heart' (Eccles. 11:9), blameless, expelling anger from your heart; and 'if the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, do not desert your place' (Eccles. 10:4), by 'place' meaning the heart. Similarly our Lord also says, 'Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts' (Matt. 15:19), and 'Do not be distracted' (Luke 12:29). And again, 'Strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leads to life' (Matt. 7:14). Elsewhere He also says, 'Blessed are the poor in spirit" (Matt. 5:3); that is to say, blessed are those who are destitute of every worldly thought. St Peter says likewise, 'Be watchful, be vigilant, because your adversary, the devil.</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian The Three Methods of Prayer</p>
      <p> walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour' (1 Pet. 5:8). And St Paul writes very plainly to the Ephesians about the guarding of the heart, "We do not wrestle against flesh and blood' (Eph. 6:12), and so on. And our holy fathers have also spoken in their writings about guarding the heart, as those who wish can see for themselves by reading what St Mark the Ascetic, St John Khmakos, St Hesychios the Priest, St Philotheos of Sinai, St Isaiah the Solitary and St Varsanuphios, and the entire book known as  The Paradise of the Fathers,  have to say about the subject.</p>
      <p> In short, if you do not guard your intellect you cannot attain purity of heart, so as to be counted worthy to see God (cf. Matt. 5:18). Without such watchfulness you cannot become poor in spirit, or grieve, or hunger and thirst after righteousness, or be truly merciful, or pure in heart, or a peacemaker, or be persecuted for the sake of justice (cf. Matt. 5:3-10). To speak generally, it is impossible to acquire all the other virtues except through watchfulness. For this reason you must pursue it more diligently than anything else, so as to learn from experience these things, unknown to others, that I am speaking to you about. Now if you would like to learn also about the method of prayer, with God's help I will tell you about this too, in so far as I can.</p>
      <p> Above all else you should strive to acquire three things, and so begin to attain what you seek. The first is freedom from anxiety with respect to everything, whether reasonable or senseless - in other words, you should be dead to everything. Secondly, you should strive to preserve a pure conscience, so that it has nothing to reproach you with. Thirdly, you should be completely detached, so that your thoughts incline towards nothing worldly, not even your own body.</p>
      <p> Then sit down in a quiet cell, in a comer by yourself, and do what I tell you. Close the door, and withdraw your intellect from everything worthless and transient. Rest your beard on your chest, and focus your physical gaze, together with the whole of your intellect, upon the centre of your belly or your navel. Restrain the drawing-m of breath through your nostrils, so as not to breathe easily, and search inside yourself with your intellect so as to find the place of the heart, where</p>
      <p> [V4] 73</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian The Three Methods of Prayer</p>
      <p> all the powers of the soul reside. To start with you will find there darkness and an impenetrable density. Later, when you persist and practice this task day and night, you will find, as though miraculously, an unceasing joy. For as soon as the intellect attains the place of the heart, at once it sees things of which it previously knew nothing. It sees the open space within the heart and it beholds itself entirely luminous and full of discrimination. From then on, from whatever side a distractive thought may appear, before it has come to completion and assumed a form, the intellect immediately drives it away and destroys it with the invocation of Jesus Christ. From this point onwards the intellect begins to be full of rancor against the demons and, rousing its natural anger against its noetic enemies, it pursues them and strikes them down. The rest you will learn for yourself, with God's help, by keeping guard over your</p>
      <p> intellect and by retaining Jesus in your heart. As the saying goes, 'Sit in your cell and it will teach you everything.'</p>
      <p> Question:  Why cannot the monk attain perfection by means of the first and second form of keeping guard?</p>
      <p> Answer.  Because he does not embark on them in the proper order. St John Klimakos likens these methods to a ladder, saying, 'Some curtail their passions; others practice psalmody, persevering most of the time in this; others devote themselves to prayer; and others turn their gaze to the depths of contemplation. When examining this question let us use the analogy of a ladder. Now those who want to ascend a ladder do not start at the top and climb down, but start at the bottom and climb up. They ascend the first step, then the second, and so the rest in turn. In this way we can ascend from earth to heaven. If, then, we wish to attain the perfect stature of the fullness of Christ, like children who are growing up we must start to climb the ladder set before us, until progressing step by step we reach the level of a full-grown man and then of an old man.</p>
      <p> The first age in the monastic state is to curtail the passions. This is the stage of beginners.</p>
      <p> The second rung or stage whereby a person grows up spiritually from adolescence to youth is assiduously to practice psalmody. For when the passions have been curtailed and laid to rest, psalmody brings</p>
      <p> [V4] 74</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian The Three Methods of Prayer</p>
      <p> delight to the tongue and is welcomed by God, since it is not possible to sing to the Lord in a strange land (cf. Ps. 137:4), that is to say, from an impassioned heart. This is the mark of those who are beginning to make progress.</p>
      <p> The third rung or stage in life, marking the spiritual transition from youth to manhood, is to persevere in prayer. This is the stage of those who are already well advanced. Prayer differs from psalmody just as the full-grown man differs from the youth and the adolescent, according to the scheme that we are following.</p>
      <p> In addition there is a fourth rung or stage in spiritual life, that of the old man with grey hairs. This signifies undeviating absorption in contemplation, and this is the state of the perfect. So the journey is complete and the top of the ladder has been reached.</p>
      <p> Since this is the way in which matters have been appointed and arranged by the Spirit, it is not possible for a child to grow up to manhood and to attain old age except by mounting the first rung of the ladder and so climbing up to perfection by the four steps in succession.</p>
      <p> For someone who desires spiritual rebirth, the first step towards the light is to curtail the passions, that is to say, to guard the heart; for it is impossible otherwise to curtail the passions. The next stage is to devote oneself to psalmody; for when the passions have been curtailed and laid to rest through the heart's resistance against them, longing for intimate union with God inflames the intellect. Strengthened by this longing the intellect repulses all distractive thoughts that encircle the heart, attempting to get in, and it rebuffs them through attentiveness. So it applies itself assiduously to the second stage, that of attentiveness and prayer. This then stirs up the evil spirits, and the blasts of passion violently agitate the depths of the heart. But through the invocation of the Lord Jesus Christ they are utterly routed and all the tumult melts like wax in the fire. But though they have been driven out of the heart the demons continue to disturb the intellect externally through the senses. However, because they can only trouble it superficially, the intellect soon regains its serenity; none the less, it can never be completely free from the attacks of</p>
      <p> the demons. Such freedom is to be found only among those who have attained fuU manhood - who are totaUy detached from everything visible and who devote themselves unceasingly to giving attention to the heart. After that, those who have achieved attentiveness are raised little by little to the wisdom of old</p>
      <p> [V4] 75</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian The Three Methods of Prayer</p>
      <p> age, that is to say, they ascend to contemplation; and this is the stage of the perfect.</p>
      <p> Thus if you practice all this in due sequence, completing each phase at the right time, your heart will first be cleansed of the passions, and you will then be able to concentrate wholly on psalmody; you will be able to wage war against the thoughts that are roused by the senses and disturb the surface of the intellect and you will gaze heavenwards, if need be, alike with your physical and your spiritual eyes, and will pray in true purity. Yet you should gaze upwards only occasionally because of the enemies that lie in ambush in the air.</p>
      <p> God asks only this of us, that our heart be purified through watchfulness. As St Paul says, if the root is holy, so also will the branches and the fruit be holy (cf Rom 11: 16). But if without following the sequence of which we have spoken you raise eyes and intellect to heaven in the hope of envisaging noetic realities you will see fantasies rather than the truth. Because our heart is still unpunfied, as we have said many times, the first and the second methods of attentiveness do not promote our progress. When we build a house we do not put on the roof before laying the foundations - this is impossible. We first lay the foundations, then build the house, and finally put on the roof. We must do the same in relation to spiritual matters. First we must lay the spiritual foundations of the house, that is to say, we must watch over the heart and curtail the passions arising from it. Then we must build the walls of the spiritual house, that is to say, through the second form of attentiveness we must repulse the turbulence of the evil spirits that fight us by means of the external senses, and must free ourselves as quickly as possible from their attacks. Then we must put on the roof, that is to say, detach ourselves entirely from all things and give ourselves wholly to God. In this way we complete our spiritual house in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be glory throughout all the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> (llth   century) (I'olume 4, pp. 76-174)</p>
      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos, the disciple and biographer of St Symeon the New Theologian, is far less well known to us than St Symeon himself.^ Bom around the beginning of the eleventh century, at an early age (c. 1020) Nikitas entered the monastery of Studios at Constantinople, and here he remained as a monk for the rest of his life, being ordained in due course to the priesthood. His personal contact with the New Theologian cannot have lasted very long, for the latter died in 1022. Before his death St Symeon commissioned Nikitas to make copies of his writings; and some years later, as a result of a vision in which the saint appeared to him, Nikitas prepared an edition of</p>
      <p> Symeon's works which was widely circulated. He acquired the  sobriquet  'Stithatos', meaning 'the Courageous', because of his outspoken opposition during the early 1040's to the illicit relations of the Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos with his mistress Skliraina. At the time of the confrontation between Cardinal Humbert and Patriarch Michael Kiroularios of Constantinople in 1054, Nikitas wrote in defence of the Orthodox Church against the Latins. It is possible that he became abbot of the Studios monastery in his extreme old age, at some point in the period 1076-92. The date of his death is unknown.</p>
      <p> In addition to his polemical works against the Latins and his biography of St Symeon, Nikitas wrote theological treatises on the soul, on paradise, and on the correlation between the angelic and the ecclesiastical hierarchies." The three Centuries of texts included in  The Philokalia  deal respectively, so the titles indicate, with the three main stages on the spiritual way: the practice of the commandments  (praktiki),  the contemplation of the inner essences of created things  (physiki),  and 'theology' or the knowledge of God  (gnosis).  Here Nikitas</p>
      <p> ' On the life and writings of Nikitas, see A. Solignac  in  Dictionnaire de Spiiitualite,  xi (1981), cols 224-30. ^ Edited by J. Darrouzes in  Sources chretiennes  81 (Paris, 1961).</p>
      <p> [V4] 77</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos Introductory Note</p>
      <p> is following the classic triadic pattern devised by Evagrios of Pontos^ and used by, among many others, St Maximos the Confessor." But in fact the contents of the Centuries do not correspond at all exactly to these titles, and Nikitas includes in each Century material relating to all three stages on the spiritual journey. While employing most frequently the Evagrian-Maximian scheme, Nikitas occasionally combines this with the somewhat different sequence proposed by St Dionysios the Areopagite, in which the three stages are described as the purgative, the illuminative and the mystical (III, 41-4). Elsewhere he adopts the threefold classification found in St Isaac the Syrian: carnal, psychic and spiritual (II, 3-7).</p>
      <p> Although his style is more complex and his approach more abstract than are those of St Symeon the New Theologian, Nikitas shares in common with his master many dominant themes. There are frequent references to the divine light (II, 2, 5, 43, 45, etc.), but at the same time Nikitas places more emphasis than does his master upon St Dionysios the Areopagite's symbolism of divine darkness (I, 1, 42; II, 50-1; III, 39, 53). Like St Symeon, Nikitas underlines the role of the spiritual father (I, 35; II, 10, 53-4) and maintains that a life of holiness is always possible, whatever a person's outward situation; it is not necessary to withdraw physically into the desert (I, 72), for the true 'flight from the world' is the inner renunciation of our self-will (I, 2, 75-6). Faithful to the example set by the New Theologian, Nikitas insists that those initiated into the divine mysteries must then act as 'missionaries', telling others about the gifts of grace which they have received (II, 96; III, 13, 27-8, etc.); and he agrees with St Symeon the Studite that love for others is higher than prayer (II, 76).</p>
      <p> One theme in particular that Nikitas derives from St Symeon the New Theologian is the vital significance of tears and compunction  (katanyxis)  within the spiritual life. The two are commonly mentioned together, although a distinction is also drawn between them (I, 71). A modem reader might easily assume that both of these things are primarily negative and penitential in character, but this is to misunderstand Nikitas' viewpoint. Following St John Klimakos, ^ he</p>
      <p> ' See  The  Philokalia,  vol. i (London and Boston, 1979), p. 57; and compare the Glossary, 'Contemplation'.</p>
      <p> ^ See  The  Philokalia,  vol. ii (London and Boston, 1981), pp. 64, 90.</p>
      <p> '  See  The Ladder of Divine Ascent,  Step  1 passim,  and also the Introduction to the E.T., pp. 23-7.</p>
      <p> [V4] 78</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos Introductory Note</p>
      <p> is careful to distinguish two types of tears: those that produce 'an acrid and painful feeling', and the 'joyous tears' that are full of'delight and a sense of jubilation'. The first are caused by repentance and inner grief, the second by compunction (I, 69-70). By the same token compunction has also a bitter-sweet character: it is linked with repentance and contrition (II, 92; III, 81), but at the same time it brings sweetness, joy and light, so that Nikitas speaks of the 'intoxication' and the healing 'oil' of compunction (II, 39, 68), and describes it as a spring from Eden, a shower of rain from the Holy Spirit (II, 44; III, 84.). Tears and compunction, then, are caused not just by a realization of our own sinfulness, but also and much more fundamentally by a grateful and tender recognition of God's forgiving love.</p>
      <p> In his basic approach, Nikitas Stithatos remains always positive, although never blandly optimistic. Our human nature is essentially good, and sanctity is nothing else than a return through grace to our natural state (I, 15; II, 12, 66). The material world is likewise intrinsically good and beautiful, and forms a sacrament of God's presence, a means of ascent to the divine realm: 'Recognize the delightfulness of the Lord from the beauty of creation ... in purity ascending to the Creator through the beauty of His creatures' (I, 74, 90).</p>

      <p> On the Practice of the Virtues: One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> 1. Those who have passed the mid-point of the first stage of the spiritual path, and who have attained the triad of mystical theology, are prompted to write in a profitable manner by, it seems to me, four factors inherent in the faith, hope and love that constitute the perfect triad of the virtues. The first is the freedom - that is to say, the dispassion -of soul, which as a result of ascetic practice raises the aspirant to the contemplation of the spiritual essences of the created world and then inducts him into the divine darkness of theology. The second is the purity of intellect that arises from prayer and tears, a purity that gives birth to the consciousness of grace and from which streams of intellection flow. The third is the indwelling of the Holy Trinity within us, which produces in each of those undergoing purification the bountiful illumination of the Spirit, revealing to them the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven and disclosing the treasures of God hidden in the soul. The fourth is the constraint which as a result of God's threatening words is imposed upon all who have received the talent of the consciousness of spiritual knowledge; for God says, 'You wicked, slothful servant, you should have deposited My money with the bankers, and then when 1 came 1 would have received My capital with interest' (Matt. 25:26-27). It was certainly because of this that David in great fear wrote, 'Behold, 1 will not seal my lips, as Thou, 0 Lord, knowest. 1 have not hidden Thy righteousness within my heart; 1 have declared Thy truth and Thy salvation; 1 have not concealed Thy mercy and Thy truth from</p>
      <p> the great congregation' (Ps. 40:9-10).</p>
      <p> 2.  A life in harmony with God begins with complete flight from the world. 'Flight from the world' means the denial of the soul's desires and the transformation of the mundane will. Reverting in this way to</p>
      <p> [V4] 80</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On the Practice of the Virtues: One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> the will of God, from being worldlings we become spiritual: dead to the fallen self and to the world, we are quickened in soul and spirit in Christ.</p>
      <p> 3.  When a soul has true esteem for God, deeply-rooted faith combined with detachment from visible things, and an ascetic practice free from all self-love, it possesses, to use Solomon's phrase, a 'threefold cord' (Eccles. 4:12), not easily broken by the spirits of wickedness.</p>
      <p> 4.  In faith we hope to receive reward for our labors, and on this account we readily endure the hardship of practicing the virtues. But when we experience the pledge of the Holy Spirit, we are winged with love towards God.</p>
      <p> 5.   To be troubled by unclean thoughts does not mean that we are already of the devil's party. But when the soul becomes slack, when the intellect, because of our dissolute and unnily life, is filled with turbid and obscure images, and when our practice of the virtues lapses because of our laxity in meditation and prayer, then, even if not actively engaged in evil, we are ranked among those who deliberately crawl in sensual pleasures.</p>
      <p> 6.  As soon as the bridle of the higher senses is removed, our passions at once revolt and the baser, more slavish senses are stirred into action; for when these latter in their mindlessness are loosed from the bonds of self-control, their habit is to light upon the sources of the passions and to feed on them as upon poisonous weeds. And the longer the laxity continues, the more they do this. For such being their natural appetite they cannot refrain from indulging it once they are free to do so.</p>
      <p> 7.   Among the senses, sight and hearing possess a certain noetic quality and are more intelligent and masterful than the other three senses, taste, smell and touch, which are mindless and gross, and wait on the higher senses. For we first see and hear, and then, through the agency of the mind, we lay hold of what is before us and, smelling it, finally taste it. Thus taste, smell and touch are more animal-like or, quite simply, baser and more slavish than sight and hearing. The more gluttonous and rattish animals, both tame and wild, are especially afflicted by them, and day and night either fill themselves with food or indulge in copulation.</p>
      <p> 8.  If you refer the activities of the outer senses back to their inner counterparts - exposing your sight to the intellect, the beholder of the</p>
      <p> [V4] 81</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos On the Practice of the Virtues:</p>
      <p> One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> light of life, your hearing to the judgment of the soul, your taste to the discrimination of the intelligence, your sense of smell to the understanding of the intellect, and relating your sense of touch to the watchfulness of the heart -you will lead an angelic life on earth; while being and appearing as a man among men, you will also be an angel coexisting with angels and spiritually conscious in the same way as they are.</p>
      <p> 9.  Through the intellect, beholder of the light of divine life, we receive knowledge of God's hidden mysteries. Through the soul's faculty of judgment we winnow in the light of this knowledge the thoughts that arise within the heart, distinguishing the good from the bad. Through the discrimination of the intelligence we savor our conceptual images. Those that spring from a bitter rout we transform into sweet nourishment for the soul, or else we reject them entirely; those that spring from a virtuous and vigorous stock we accept. In this way we take every thought captive and make it obey Christ (cf 2 Cor. 10:5). Through the understanding of the intellect we smell the spiritual unguent of the grace of the Holy Spirit, our hearts filled with joy and gladness. Through the watchfulness of the' heart we consciously perceive the Spirit, who refreshes the flame of our desire for supernal blessings and warms our spiritual powers, numbed as they have been by the frost of the passions.</p>
      <p> 10.  Just as in the body there are five senses - sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch - so in the soul there are five senses: mtellect, reason, noetic perception, intuitive knowledge, and cognitive insight. These are united in three psychic activities: intellection, ratiocination, and noetic perception. By means of intellection we apprehend spiritual intentions, by means of ratiocination we interpret them, and through noetic perception we grasp the images of divine insight and spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 11.  If your intellect clearly distinguishes the intentions of its thoughts and in its purity gives its assent only to those that are divine; if your reason can interpret the physical movements of the whole of visible creation - that is to say, can clearly elucidate the inner essences of things; if noetically you can perceive heavenly wisdom and spiritual knowledge: then through the light of the Sun of righteousness you have transcended all sense-perception and have attained what lies beyond it, and you savor the delight of things unseen.</p>
      <p> 12.   The intellect comprises four principal facilities: judgment, [V4] 82</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On the Practice of the Virtues: One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> sagacity, noetic apprehension, perspicacity. If you conjoin these with the four principal virtues of the soul, linking restraint of soul to the judgment of the intellect, sound understanding to sagacity, righteousness to noetic apprehension, and courage to perspicacity, you build for yourself a two-fold fiery heaven-coursing chariot that will protect you against the three major principalities and powers of the mustered passions: avarice, self-indulgence and love of praise.</p>
      <p> 13.   To master the mundane will of the fallen self you have to fulfill three conditions. First, you have to overcome avarice by embracing the law of righteousness, which consists in merciful compassion for one's fellow beings;</p>
      <p> second, you have to conquer self-indulgence through prudent self-restraint, that is to say, through all-inclusive self-control; and, third, you have to prevail over your love of praise through sagacity and sound understanding, in other words through exact discrimination in things human and divine, trampling such love underfoot as something cloddish and worthless. All this you have to do until the mundane will is converted into the law of the spirit of life and liberated from domination by the law of the outer fallen self. Then you can say, 'I thank God that the law of the spirit of life has freed me from the law and dominion of death' (cf. Rom. 8:2).</p>
      <p> 14.  If you aspire to the spuriousness of human praise as though it were something authentic, wallow in self-indulgence because of your soul's insatiability, and through your greed entwine yourself with avarice, you will either make yourself demonic through self-conceit and arrogance, or degenerate into bestiality through the gratification of belly and genitals, or become savage to others because of your gross inhuman avarice. In this way your faith in God will lapse, as Christ said it would when you accept human praise (cf. John 5:44.); you will abandon self-restraint and purity because your lower organs are unsatedly kindled and succumb to unbridled appetence; and you will be shut out from love because you minister solely to yourself and do not succor your fellow beings when they are in need. Like some polymorphic monster compounded thus out of multifarious self-antagonistic parts, you will be the implacable enemy of God, man and the animals.</p>
      <p> 15.  If when aroused and active a man's mcensive, appetitive and intelligent powers spontaneously operate in accordance with nature, they make him wholly godlike and divine, sound in his actions and never in any way dislodged from nature's bedrock. But if, betraying his</p>
      <p> [V4] 83</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On the Practice of the Virtues: One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> own nature, he follows a course that is contrary to nature, these same powers will turn him, as we have said, into a polymorphic monster, compounded of many self-antagonistic parts.</p>
      <p> 16.  Our mcensive power lies between the appetitive' and intelligent aspects of our soul; for both of them it serves as a weapon, whether it is acting in a way that accords with or is contrary to nature. When our desire and intelligence, in a way that accords with nature, aspire to what is divine, then our mcensiveness is for both of them a weapon of righteousness wielded solely against the hissing serpent that would persuade them to indulge in fleshly pleasures and to relish men's praise. But when we fail to act according to nature and direct our desire and intelligence to what is contrary to nature, transferring attention from what is divine to purely human matters, then our incensive power becomes a weapon of iniquity in the service of sin, and we use it to attack and fight against those who would restrain the passions and appetites of the other powers of our soul. Thus, whether we are engaged in ascetic practice or are contemplatives and theologians, when we act according to nature we prove; ourselves to be among the faithful members of the Church, and when we act contrary to nature we become bestial, savage and demonic.</p>
      <p> 17.  Unless through the labor of repentance and assiduous ascetic practice we first restore the soul's powers to the state in which they were when God originally formed Adam and breathed into him the breath of life (cf Gen. 2:7), we will never be able to know ourselves; nor will we be able to acquire a disposition that is master of the passions.</p>
      <p> free from arrogance, not over-curious, guileless, simple, humble, without jealousy or malice, and that takes every thought captive and makes it obey Christ (cf. 2 Cor.  10:5).  Nor will our soul be enkindled with God's love, never transgressing the bounds of self-control, but content with what is given to it and longing for the serenity of the saints. And if we do not achieve such a state we can never acquire a heart that is gentle, peaceful, free from anger, kind, uncontentious and filled with mercy and joy; for our soul will be divided against itself and because of the turbulence of its powers will remain impervious to the rays of the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 18.  If we do not regain the beauty of our original high estate, continually renewing the impress of the image of Him who created us in His likeness (cf. Gen. 1:26-27), but instead distance ourselves from Him through the disparity of our qualities, how can we ever enter</p>
      <p> [V4] 84</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On the Practice of the Virtues: One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> into union with Him? How can we enter into union with Him who is light when we have blotted out the light and have embraced its opposite? And if we are not united to Him from whom we have received the source of our being, and through whom we have come into existence from things that are not and have been made preeminent over things that are; and if, because of our unlikeness to our Creator we are severed from Him, where will we be cast? This will be clear to those who can see, even if I am silent.</p>
      <p> 19.  So long as we have the raw material of the passions within ourselves and, instead of repudiating it, deliberately nurture it, the passions will prevail over us, deriving their strength from us. But when we cast this raw material out, cleansing our hearts with the tears of repentance and abhorring the deceitfulness of visible things, then we share in the presence of the Paraclete: we see God in eternal light and are seen by Him.</p>
      <p> 20.  Those who have broken the bonds of worldly sense-perception are free from all servitude to the senses: they live solely in the Spirit, communing with Him, impelled by Him, and brought through Him in some measure into union with the Father and the Logos who are one in essence with Him; and so they become a single spirit with God, as St Paul says (cf 1 Cor. 6:17). Not only are they exempt from the dominion of the demons but they actually fill them with terror, since they share in the divine fire and are in fact called fire.</p>
      <p> 21.  Our sense of touch is not partial in the sense that its activity is restricted to one part of the body, as is that of the other senses; it is a general, all-over sense belonging to the whole body. Thus if while still addicted to the lubricity of things we touch some object unnecessarily, passion-charged thoughts perturb the intellect; but if, after renouncing such addiction and rising above the realm of sense, we touch something in accordance with a need inherent in our nature, then our sense of touch has no tendency to seduce the soul's organs of perception.</p>
      <p> 22.   When the intellect is established in the realm of what is beyond nature, the senses, assuming their natural role, commune dispassionately with the springs of the passions; they seek out only their underlying essences and natures, unerringly distinguishing their activities and qualities while not being addicted to them or adventitiously attracted by them in a manner that is contrary to nature.</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On the Practice of the Virtues: One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> so long, that is, as the passions have been stilled; for what is difficult for those who are still dominated by the senses is easy and even delightful for an aspiring soul that through its holly exertions has acquired a longing for God and is smitten with desire for divine knowledge. For the sense-dominated, the labors and struggles for virtue, opposed as they are to bodily ease and indulgence in sensual pleasure, are difficult and seem very harsh, for in such people the brackish taste of pleasure has not yet been washed away by the flow of tears. But the soul that abominates pain-inducing pleasure and has rejected comfort along with the self-love of the body, feels the need for and embraces such labor and struggles. One thing alone distresses it: slackness in its labors and indolence in its struggles. Thus what for those still dominated by the senses is the source of bodily content is for the soul that aspires to what is divine a cause of distress. And what for the aspiring soul is a cause of spiritual gladness is for the sense-dominated the cause of pain and anguish.</p>
      <p> 24.  Ascetic toil is initially painful for all those newly engaged in spiritual warfare; but for those exercised in the growth of virtue and who have reached the mid-point of their path, such toil is pleasurable and produces a strange sense of relief. When the mortal will of the flesh is swallowed up by the immortal life (cf 2 Cor. 5:4) conferred through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in those truly striving towards the perfection of virtue, they are filled with unspeakable joy and gladness, for a pure spring of tears has opened within them, and streams of sweet compunction flow down on them from above.</p>
      <p> 25.  If you wish to advance to the frontiers of virtue and to find unerringly the path that leads to God, do not allow your eyes to sleep or let your eyelids droop or give rest to your brow (cf. Ps. 132:4) until, with your soul riven by toil and tears, you have attained the land of dispassion and have entered into the sanctuary of the knowledge of God. For then, aloof from all that is below, in your great thirst you will have climbed like a stag to the high mountains of contemplation and through God's personalized Wisdom you will have descried the ultimate reaches of human life.</p>
      <p> 26.   For those newly engaged in spiritual warfare the swift path to the recovery of virtue consists in the silencing of the lips, the closure of the eyes and the stopping of the ears; for once the intellect has achieved this kind of intermission and has sealed off the external entrances to itself, it begins to understand itself and its own activities.</p>
      <p> [V4] 86</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On the Practice of the Virtues: One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> It immediately sets about interrogating the ideas swimming in the noetic sea of its thought, trying to discern whether the concepts that irrupt into the mind's crucible are pure, alloyed with no bitter seed, and conferred by an angel of light, or whether they are tares, hybridized, trashy, emanating from the devil. Standing thus like a masterful</p>
      <p> sovereign in the midst of its thoughts, judging them and separating the better from the worse, the intellect accepts those that are well-tested in the fire of the Spirit and saturated with divine water, absorbing them into its actions and practice and storing them up in its spiritual treasure-house; for by these thoughts it is nourished, strengthened and filled with light. The other thoughts it casts into the depths of oblivion, eradicating their bitterness. This is the work only of someone who has spiritually embarked upon the path that leads unerringly to the heavens and to God, and who has stripped off the lugubrious cloak of the dark passions.</p>
      <p> 27.  Once the soul has divested itself of malice and of its futile propensity to cheap arrogance, and through the indwelling of the Paraclete has adorned the heart with simplicity and innocence, it will immediately be restored to God and to itself And since it has now passed beyond the hellish pits of incredulity and malevolence, it will unhesitatingly accept what it hears and sees as trustworthy and true.</p>
      <p> 28.  Deep-rooted faith is pre-eminent among the virtues, since such faith strips the soul of doubt and rids it completely of self-love. For nothing so prevents someone newly engaged in spiritual warfare from practicing the commandments as this pernicious vice of self-love. It even prevents the progress of those well advanced on the spiritual path, for it suggests illnesses to them and malignant bodily ailments, so that their ardor wanes and they are persuaded to give up ascetic toil on the grounds that in their susceptible state it is dangerous. Self-love is inane amity for the body, which ends by making the monk a lover of himself - of his own soul and body - and so estranges him from God and from God's kingdom, in accordance with the gospel phrase, 'He who loves his life will destroy it' (John 12:25).</p>
      <p> 29.  He who diligently begins to practice God's commandments, and with ardent longing shoulders the light yoke of asceticism (cf Matt. 11:30), does not spare his body's health, or flinch at virtue's harsh demands, or shrink from exertion, or heed the laziness and negligence of others. Rather, whatever the hardship, he fervently ploughs the furrow of the virtues, attending only to himself and to the</p>
      <p> [V4] 87</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On the Practice of the Virtues: One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> commandments of God. Each day with tears he tills and sows the land of the living (cf. Ps. 126:5) until the first shoots of dispassion germinate within him, wax into divine knowledge, bear the grain of the Logos and fructify in His righteousness.</p>
      <p> 30.  Nothing, I think, so promotes the soul's swift progress as faith - not just faith in God and in His only-begotten Son, but faith that is deeply rooted. With this faith we believe in the truth of Christ's promises, made and kept in readiness for those who love Him (cf. 1 Cor. 2:19), just as we also believe in the truth of the threats and the infernal punishments prepared for the devil and his accomplices (cf. Matt. 25:41). This faith inspires the striving soul with the hope that it will attain the state of the saints, their blessed dispassion, climbing the heights of their holiness and becoming a coheir with them of God's kingdom. With such assurance the soul assiduously and unwaveringly augments its practice of the commandments, imitating the labors of the saints and pursuing their perfection by means of similar struggles.</p>
      <p> 31.   The external appearance of the face changes in accordance with the inner state of the soul: whatever the soul's noetic activity, it will be reflected in the face. Disposed and changed according to the thoughts within the soul, the face brightens when the heart rejoices in the upsurge of good thoughts and in its meditation on God, but is downcast and glum when the heart is embittered by unnatural thoughts. In both cases, what is happening is quite evident to those in whom the soul's organs of perception are well trained. Either it is a change brought about by 'the right hand of the Most High' (Ps. 77:10. LXX), and this is obvious to them because it is something familiar and dear to them whereby they are reborn in the Spirit and become light and salt to others near them (cf. Matt. 5:13-14); or else is a change brought about by the discord of evil powers and the tumult of our thoughts, and this too is evident to them, since they resist such change, the impress of the image of the Son of God within them having been burnished to the highest degree by the rays of divine grace.</p>
      <p> 32.  A soul receives either blessings or penalties and punishment according to its inner activities. If it concerns itself with things divine and tills the ground of humility, tears fall on it like rain from heaven, and it cultivates love for God, faith and compassion for others. And when in this way the soul is renewed in the beauty of Christ's image, it becomes a light to others; attracting their attention with the rays of its virtue, it inspires them to glorify God. But if the soul devotes itself to</p>
      <p> [V4] 88</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On the Practice of the Virtues: One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> mundane and merely human matters, stirring and agitating the fetid waters of sin, it nourishes hatred and repels what is good and beautiful. Deformed in this way according to the mundane, ugly image of fallen man, it becomes a thing of darkness to others; and through its evil talk and depravity it corrupts immature and fickle souls, inducing them to blaspheme God. Thus the soul receives its reward according to the state it is in when death overtakes it.</p>
      <p> 33.  If you husband evil thoughts your face will be morose and sullen; your tongue will be incapable of praising God and you will be surly towards others. But if you husband in your heart what is deathless and holy, your face will radiate joy and gladness, you will lift up your voice in prayer and be most gentle in speech. Thus it will be quite clear to all whether you are still subject to unclean passions and to the law of the mundane will, or whether you are free from such servitude and live according to the law of the Spirit. In the words of Solomon, 'A glad heart makes the face radiant; but a doleful heart makes it sullen' (cf. Prov. 15:13).</p>
      <p> 34.  Passions acted out can be cured by action. Dissipation, sensuality, gluttony and a dissolute, profligate life produce a passion-charged state of soul and impel it to unnatural actions. On the other hand, restraint and self-control, ascetic labor and spiritual struggle translate the soul from its passion-charged state to a state of dispassion.</p>
      <p> 35.  If after strenuous ascetic labor you receive great gifts from God on account of your humility, but are then dragged down and handed over to the passions and to the chastisement of the demons, you must know that you have exalted yourself, have thought much of yourself, and have disparaged others. And you will find no cure for or release from the passions and demons that afflict you unless you make use of a good mediator and through humility and awareness of your limitations you repent and return to your original state. Such humility and self-knowledge lead all who are firmly rooted in virtue to look upon themselves as the lowest of created things.</p>
      <p> 36.  In the eyes of God and of those who hve a Christ-hke hfe, to act with passion because of one's dissolute character and to take pride in one's virtues through a spirit of self-conceit are each as evil as the other. In the first case it is shameful even to speak of the things that those enslaved to the passions do in secret (cf Eph. 5:12); in the second case the self-vaunting of the heart is an abomination to God. The dissolute person alienates himself from God, for he is 'flesh' (cf Gen. 6:3),</p>
      <p> [V4] 89</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On the Practice of the Virtues: One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> while the person who takes pride in his virtue is unclean in God's sight because of his self-conceit.</p>
      <p> 37.  A passion is not the same thing as a sinful act: they are quite distinct. A passion operates in the soul, a sinful act involves the body. For example, love of pleasure, avarice and love of praise are three particularly noxious passions of the soul; but unchastity, greed and wrong-doing are sinful acts of the flesh. Lust anger and arrogance are passions of the soul produced when the soul's powers operate in a way that is contrary to nature. Adultery, murder, theft, drunkenness and whatever else is done through the body, are smful and noxious actions of the flesh.</p>
      <p> 38.   The three most general passions are self-indulgence, avarice and love of praise; and three are the ranks of men that fight against them and overcome them: those newly embarked on the spiritual path, those in mid-course, and those who have attamed its goal.</p>
      <p> 39.  The battle waged by those in the three stages of the spiritual path against these three principles and powers of the prince of this world is not one and the same, but at each stage the battle is different. At each stage there is a different way of fighting against these passions, and each way makes lawful and natural use of the power of righteous indignation.</p>
      <p> 40.  If it is but recently that you have embarked on the struggle for holiness and ranked yourself against the passions, you must battle unremittingly and through every kind of ascetic hardship against the spirit of self-indulgence. You must waste your flesh through fasting, sleeping on the ground, vigils and night-long prayer; you must bring your soul into a state of contrition through thinking on the torments of hell and through meditation on death; and you must through tears of repentance purge your heart of all the defilement that comes from coupling with impure thoughts and giving your assent to them.</p>
      <p> 41.   When you approach the mid-point of the initial stage of the spiritual path you will experience the first form of dispassion, and through it the strain of your exertions against the spirit of self-indulgence will be eased. Your eyes opened, you will begin to perceive the inner nature of things, and will now take up the weapons of faith against the spirit of perfidious avarice. You will exalt your intellect through meditation on things divine and quicken your thought with the inner essences of the created world, elucidating their true nature.</p>
      <p> [V4] 90</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On the Practice of the Virtues: One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> In faith you will lead your soul from what is visible to the heights of the invisible, assured that God, who brings all things from non-existence into existence, provides for all that He has created. In this way your whole aspiration will be directed towards life in God.</p>
      <p> 42.  When through contemplation and dispassion you have passed the half-way mark of the spiritual journey and have transcended the deceitfulness of worldly sense-perception, you will now enter the divine darkness of theology, guided by the consciousness of spiritual knowledge and by God's personalized Wisdom. It is at this point that with the strength of humility you raise your weapons against the spirit of self-glory and the love of praise. Your soul will be spurred by holy revelations and painlessly you will pour forth tears; you will be humbled in your will through the recognition of human weakness, and exalted by intimations of divine knowledge.</p>
      <p> 43.  By means of fasting, vigils, prayer, sleeping on the ground, bodily labors and the amputation of our desires through humility of soul, we inactivate the spirit of self-indulgence. We overcome it through tears of repentance and, shackling it with self-control, render it immobile and ineffective; for we are now among those proficient in spiritual warfare.</p>
      <p> 44.  Repulsing and finally slaying the spirit of avarice with the weapons of faith and 'the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God' (Eph. 6:17), we now approach, thanks to the consciousness of Wisdom, the contemplation of the inner essences of created beings. Illumined with the consciousness of spiritual knowledge, we pass beyond the lowly region of visible things and attain the realms of love, rich in God-inspired hope.</p>
      <p> 45.  Winged by dispassion and humility, and inspired by the Holy Spirit, we enter the sphere of mystical theology and the abyss of the knowledge of God's mysteries. The spirit of self-gloiy is now consumed in the lightning of divine thought and doctrine. Weeping and filled with compunction we perceive the consummation of things human, and scatter that spirit's minions, who attack us through presumption, self-esteem and arrogance.</p>
      <p> 46.  He who wholeheartedly hates and renounces 'the desire of the fallen self, the desire of the eyes, and the false pretentions of this life' (1 John 2:16) - that whole 'world of iniquity' (Jas. 3:6) through the love of which we become the enemies of God (cf Jas. 4:4) - has crucified the world to himself and himself to the world: he has</p>
      <p> [V4] 91</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On the Practice of the Virtues: One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> destroyed in his flesh the enmity between God and his soul, and has made peace between the two (cf Eph. 2:15). For he who has died to these things through effacing the will of the flesh has reconciled himself to God. He has eradicated the enmity of this world by obliterating sensual pleasure through a life crucified to the world, and has embraced friendship with Jesus. He is no longer God's enemy because of his love for the world, but is a friend of God, crucified to the world and able to say, 'The world is crucified to me, and I to the world' (Gal. 6:14).</p>
      <p> 47. God deserts those engaged in spiritual warfare for three reasons: because of their arrogance, because they</p>
      <p> censure others, and because they are so cock-a-hoop about their own virtue. The presence of any of these vices in the soul prompts God to withdraw; and until they are expelled and replaced by radical humility, the soul will not escape just punishment.</p>
      <p> 48.   It is not only passion-charged thoughts that sully the heart and defile the soul. To be elated about one's many achievements, to be puffed up about one's virtue, to have a high idea of one's wisdom and spiritual knowledge, and to criticize those who are lazy and negligent - all this has the same effect, as is clear from the parable of the publican and the Pharisee (cf Luke 18:10-14).</p>
      <p> 49.   Do not imagine that you will be delivered from your passions, or escape the defilement of the passion-charged thoughts which these generate, while your mind is still swollen with pride because of your virtues. You will not see the courts of peace, your thoughts full of loving-kindness, nor, generous and calm in heart, will you joyfully enter the temple of love, so long as you presume on yourself and on your own works.</p>
      <p> 50.  If your soul is allured by comeliness of body and usurped by the passion-imbued thoughts that it seems to evoke, do not assume that such comeliness is the cause of your agitated and impassioned state. The cause lies hidden in your soul, and it is your soul's passionate disposition and evil habits that, as a magnet attracts iron, attracts to itself such impurity from the beauty it perceives. For all things are created by God and all, as He Himself says, are 'wholly good and beautiful' (Gen. 1:31), providing no ground at all for impugning His creation.</p>
      <p> 51.  Just as seasickness is due, not to the sea's nature, but to the already existing disorder of the body's humors, so the soul's</p>
      <p> [V4] 92</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On the Practice of the Virtues: One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> confusion and turmoil are due, not to the beauty of countenance in the person that it perceives, but to its preexisting evil disposition.</p>
      <p> 52.  The soul's apprehension of the nature of things changes in accordance with its own inner state. Thus when its spiritual organs of perception operate in a way that accords with nature and the intellect unerringly penetrates to the inner essences of things, clearly and cogently elucidating their nature and function, then it perceives things and persons and every material body as they are according to nature, and is aware that no seed of impurity or vitiation lies hidden within them. But when its powers operate in a way that is contrary to nature, and are in a state of self-antagonism, it perceives things likewise in a way that is not in accord with nature; their natural beauty does not exalt it to an understanding of their Maker, but because of its own impassioned proclivities engulfs it in self-destruction.</p>
      <p> 53.   If while you are engaged in ascetic labor and hardship God withdraws from you because of some bodily lapse, or lapse of tongue or thought, do not take this to be strange or untoward. The lapse is yours and due to yourself. Had you not yourself first indulged in some new-fangled, overweening and obnoxious thought about yourself, or had you not in arrogance treated someone disdainfully or criticized him for his human weakness, you would have recognized your own fallibility and God in His righteous judgment would not have withdrawn from you. Learn from this not to judge (cf Matt. 7:1), not to think too highly of yourself (cf Rom. 12:3), and not to look down on others (cf. 1 Cor.</p>
      <p> 54.  When you have faUen into the depths of wickedness, do not despair of your recaU, even if you have been brought down to the nethermost reaches of hell. For if through the practice of the virtues you have already established your ascetic life on a firm basis, God will not forget your former labors and hardships even if the stones of virtue you have set in place should be shaken to the ground by the most impassioned of vices. Only you must bring to Him a heart full of contrition for your lapse, and you must 'remember the days of old' (cf. Ps. 143:5), recalling your fall with deep sorrow before Him. He will then swiftly visit you as you tremble at His words (cf. Isa. 66:2), and invisibly will touch the eyes of your grieving heart, recognizing the basis of virtue you have already established through your labors; and together with fervor of spirit He will give you strength that is greater and more perfect than your former strength. In this way the house of</p>
