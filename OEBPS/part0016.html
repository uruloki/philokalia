      <p> 67.  I wish to elucidate, so far as I can, a subject that is as subtle as it is profound. The infinite and bodiless Lord, who is beyond being, in His infinite bounty embodies and, so to say, reduces Himself so that He can commingle with the intelligible beings that He has created-with, that is, the souls of saints and of angels - thereby making it possible for them to participate in the immortal life of His own divinity. Now each thing - whether angel, soul or demon - is, in conformity with its own nature, a body. No matter how subtle it may be, each thing possesses a body whose subtlety in substance, form and image corresponds to the subtlety of its own nature. In the case of human beings the soul, which is a subtle body, has enveloped and clothed itself in the members of our visible body, which</p>
      <p> is gross in substance. It has clothed itself in the eye, through which it sees; in the ear, through which it hears; in the hand, the nose. In short, the soul has clothed itself in the whole visible body and all its members, becoming commingled with them, and through them accomplishing everything it does in this life. In the same way, in His unutterable and inconceivable bounty Christ reduces and embodies Himself, commingling with and embracing the soul that aspires to Him with faith and love and, as St Paul puts it (cf 1 Cor. 6:17), becoming one spirit with it. His soul united with our soul and His Person with our person. Thus such a soul lives and has its being in His divinity, attaining immortal life and delighting in incorruptible pleasure and inexpressible glory.</p>
      <p> 68. In a soul of this kind the Lord when He wills is fire, consuming every sinful and alien thing in it, in accordance with the words, "Our God is a consuming fire' (Deut. 4:24); at other times He is repose, wondrous and indescribable; or else joy and peace, cherishing and embracing it. Only it must aspire to Him with love and devote Itself</p>
      <p> [V3] 315</p>

      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> to holy ways of life, and then through direct experience, with its own perception, it will see itself partaking of unutterable blessings that "the eye has not seen, and the ear has not heard, and man's heart has not grasped' (1 Cor. 2:9). For to the soul that proves itself worthy of Him the Spirit of the Lord is now repose, now intense joy, now delight and life. Just as He embodies Himself in spiritual food, so He embodies Himself in indescribable raiment and beauty, so that He fills the soul with spiritual gladness. As He Himself said: 'I am the bread of life' (John 6:35); and: 'If anyone drinks of the water that I give him ... it will be in him a spring of water welling up for eternal life' (John 4:14).</p>
      <p> 69.   Hence God was seen by each priest and saint as He willed and as was most profitable to the beholder. Thus He was seen in one way by Abraham, in another by Isaac, in another by Jacob, in another by Noah, by Daniel, by Moses, by David and by each of the prophets. He reduced and embodied Himself, giving Himself a different form and appearing to those who loved Him, not as He is in Himself-for He is beyond man's grasp - but according to their capacity and strength; and He did this because of the great, incomprehensible love that He had for them.</p>
      <p> 70.   The soul found worthy to be the dwelling-place of supernal power, and whose members are commingled with that divine fire and with the celestial love of the Holy Spirit, is set free completely from all worldly love. Iron or lead, or gold and silver, melts when put into fire, and its natural solidity is softened, so that it is malleable and pliant so long as it is in the fire. Similarly, once the soul has received the celestial fire of the love of the Spirit, it renounces every attachment to the spirit of this world, breaks free from the bonds of evil, loses the natural obduracy of sin, and regards all worldly things as of no account. So much is this the case that should a soul, conquered by such love, find that certain brothers who are very dear to it impede its dedication to that love, then it will withdraw its affection from them. Nuptial love separates one from the love of father and mother, sister and brother, and any love one may</p>
      <p> bear them will be slight, since one's whole heart and desire are directed towards one's spouse. If earthly love dissolves all other worldly affection in this way, those wounded by that dispassionate longing will not be held back in the least by the love of anything worldly.</p>
      <p> 71.  Being bountiful and full of love. God awaits with great patience the repentance of every sinner, and He celebrates the return of the sinner with celestial rejoicing; as He Himself says, 'There is joy in</p>

      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> heaven over one sinner who repents' (cf. Luke 15:7,10). But when someone sees this generosity and patience, and how God awaits repentance and so does not punish sins one by one, he may neglect the commandment and make such generosity an excuse for indifference, adding sin to sin, offence to offence, laziness to laziness. In this way he will reach the furthest limits of sin, and fall into such transgression that he is not able to recover himself. On the contrary, sinking into the lowest depths and finally committing himself to the devil, he destroys himself. That is what happened to the people of Sodom: reaching and even going beyond the furthest limits of sin - for not a single spark of repentance was to be found among them - they were consumed by the fire of divine justice (cf Gen. 19:1-28). It also happened in the time of Noah: people had surrendered so unrestrainedly to the impulses to evil, piling up such a load of sin on themselves and showing not the least sign of repentance, that the whole earth became corrupt (cf. Gen. 6:5). Similarly, God was bountiful to the Egyptians, although they had sinned greatly and had maltreated His people: He did not hand them over to total destruction, but through gradual chastisement He induced them to repent. Yet when they lapsed and returned enthusiastically to their evil ways and to their original disbelief, finally even pursuing the Lord's people as they departed from Egypt, divine justice destroyed them completely (cf. Exod. 14:23-28). God also showed His habitual forbearance towards the people of Israel, although they too had sinned greatly and had killed His prophets. Yet when they became so committed to evil that they did not respect even the royal dignity of His Son, but laid murderous hands upon Him, they were utterly rejected and cast aside: prophecy, priesthood and service were taken from them and were entrusted to the Gentiles who believed (cf. Matt. 21:33-43).</p>
      <p> 72.  Let us draw near eagerly to Christ who summons us, surrendering our hearts to Him, and let us not despair of our salvation, deliberately giving ourselves over to evil. For it is a trick of the devil to lead us to despair by reminding us of our past sins. We must realize that if Christ when on earth healed and restored the blind, the paralyzed and the dumb, and raised the dead that were already in a state of decomposition, how much more will He heal blindness of mind, paralysis of soul, and dumbness of the dissolute heart. For He who created the body also created the soul. And if He</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> was so bounteous and merciful to what is mortal and disintegrates, how much more compassionate and healing will He not be to the immortal soul, overpowered by the sickness of evil and ignorance, when it turns to Him and asks Him for help? For it is He who said: "Will not My heavenly Father vindicate those who call to Him night and day? Yes, I assure you. He will vindicate them swiftly' (cf. Luke 18:7-8); and: 'Ask and it will be given to you, seek; and you will find, knock and it will be opened to you" (Matt. 7:7); and again: 'If he will not give to him out of friendship, yet on account of his persistence he will get up and give him what he needs' (cf. Luke 11:8). Moreover, He came so that sinners should turn back to Him (cf. Matt. 9:13). Only let us devote ourselves to the Lord, rejecting in so far as we can our evil prepossessions; and He will not overlook us, but will be ready to offer us His help.</p>
      <p> 73.   When a person is so sick and weak that his body cannot accept food and drink, he is reduced to despair and becomes a living image of death, and his friends and relatives mourn over him. Similarly, God and the angels mourn and are full of sorrow for souls incapable of absorbing celestial nourishment. But if you become God's throne and He Himself takes His seat on it; if your whole soul is a spiritual eye, all light; if you nourish yourself on the sustenance of the Spirit and drink living water and the spiritual wine that rejoices the heart (cf. Ps. 104:15); if you clothe your soul in ineffable light - if inwardly you attain experience and full assurance of all these things, then you will live the truly eternal life, reposing in Christ while still in this present world. If you have not yet attained this state or have not started to acquire it, you should weep bitterly and lament because you still do not as yet possess such riches; and you should constantly be mindful of your poverty and should pray because of it. But even the man who has attained this state should still be aware of his dearth lest, as though sated with divine riches, he becomes negligent. As the Lord says, he who seeks will find and to him who knocks it will be opened (cf. Matt. 7:8).</p>
      <p> 74.  If the oil formed from different spices (cf. Exod. 30:23-25) had such power that those anointed with it attained a royal status (cf. 1 Sam. 10:1; 16:13), will not those whose intellect and inner being are anointed with the sanctifying oil of gladness (cf. Ps. 45:7), and who have received the pledge of the Holy Spirit, even more surely attain the realm of perfection - that is to say, Christ's kingdom and</p>

      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homilies</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> adoption by Him - and become the King's companions, entering and leaving the Father's presence as they wish? Even if they have not yet entered totally into their inheritance, being still burdened with the weight of the flesh, yet through the pledge of the Spirit they will be fully assured of the things for which they hope, and will not have any doubt that they will reign with Christ and will enjoy the supra-abundant fullness of the Spirit: though still clothed in the flesh, they have had direct experience of that power and that pleasure. For grace, once it has been conferred as a result of the purification of the intellect and the inner being, completely removes the veil in which man was wrapped by Satan after the fall, expelling every defilement and every sordid thought from the soul. Its aim is to cleanse the soul, so enabling it to recover its original nature and to contemplate the glory of the true light with clear, unimpeded eyes. Once this is achieved, man is here and now raised to the eternal world and perceives its beauty and its wonder. Just as the physical eye, as long as it is sound and healthy, gazes confidently at the sun's rays, so such a man, his intellect illumined and purified, always contemplates the never-setting light of the Lord.</p>
      <p> 75.  It is not easy for men to reach this level. It requires much toil, struggle and suffering. In many, although grace is active, evil is still present together with it, lying hidden: the two spirits, that of light and that of darkness, are at work in the same heart. Naturally, you will ask what communion light can have with darkness, or what concord can God's temple have with idols (cf 2 Cor. 6:14,16). I will answer you with the same words: what communion can light have with darkness? Pure and unsullied as it is, in what way is the divine light darkened, obscured or sullied? The light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not grasp it" (John 1:5). Thus things must not be interpreted in isolation or in a single way. Some repose in God's grace only for as long as they can keep a hold over themselves and can avoid being vanquished by the sinfulness dwelling within them: for a time they can pray diligently and are at rest, but then unclean thoughts become active within them and they are taken captive by sin, which in their case clearly coexists with grace. Those who are superficial, and who have not yet grasped the precise degree to which divine energy is active in them, think they have been delivered once and for all from sin; but those who are intelligent and possess discrimination would not deny that, though God's grace dwells</p>
      <p> [V3] 319</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>

      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> within them, they may also be harassed by shameful and unnatural thoughts.</p>
      <p> 76.  We have often known brethren who have enjoyed such richness of grace that all sinful desire has completely dried up and been extinguished in them for five or six years. Then, just when they thought they had reached a haven</p>
      <p> and found peace, evil has leapt upon them as though from an ambush so savagely and with such hostility that they have been thrown into confusion and doubt. No one, therefore, who possesses understanding would dare to say that once grace dwells in him he is thereafter free from sin. As we said, both grace and sin may be active in the same intellect, even if the gullible and ignorant, after having had some slight spiritual experience, claim that they have already won the battle. This, in my opinion, is how things are: dark air or mist suddenly rising may obscure the sun's light even when it is shining brightly; in a similar manner those who, although enjoying God's grace, have not yet been completely purified and in their depths are still under the sway of sin, may also be suddenly overcome by darkness. Truly, it needs great discrimination to perceive these things in one's actual experience in a foolproof way.</p>
      <p> 77.  Just as it is impossible for a person without eyes, tongue, ears and feet, to see, talk, hear or walk, so also it is impossible to commune in the divine mysteries, know God's wisdom or be enriched by the Spirit, without God's help and the energy He gives. The Greek sages were trained in the use of words and engaged spiritedly in verbal battles. The servants of God, even if they lack skill in argument, are familiar in every way with divine knowledge and God's grace.</p>
      <p> 78.   I am convinced that not even the apostles, although filled with the Holy Spirit, were therefore completely free from anxiety. In addition to exultation and inexpressible joy they also felt a certain fear, prompted, to be sure, not from the side of evil but by grace itself; for grace was so securely established within them that they could not in fact deviate at all from the right path. And just as a child by throwing a small pebble does no real harm to a wall, or as a feeble arrow can damage a strong breastplate only very slightly, so even if some evil thing assailed them, the attack proved to be utterly ineffectual and vain, since they were well protected by the power of Christ. Yet even though they were perfect they still possessed their free will; contrary to the stupid view expressed by some, the advent</p>

      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> of grace does not mean immediate deliverance from anxiety. The Lord asks even from the perfect that the soul's will should serve the Spirit, so that the two come together. "Do not quench the Spirit", says St Paul (1 Thess. 5:19).</p>
      <p> 79.   To explain things in superficial terms is not difficult or troublesome. For example, it is easy for anyone to say that this loaf is made from wheat; yet to expound stage by stage how bread is made lies within the competence not of everyone but only of those with experience. Similarly, it is easy to speak superficially about dispassion and perfection; but the stages by which they are achieved can be truly understood only by those who have attained them in their actual experience.</p>
      <p> 80.  Those who hold forth about spiritual realities without having tasted and experienced them are like a man traversing an empty and arid plain at high noon on a summer's day: in his great and burning thirst he imagines that</p>
      <p> there is a cool spring close at hand, full of sweet clear water, and that there is nothing to prevent him from drinking it to his heart's content. Or they are like a man who, without having tasted a drop of honey, tries to explain to others what its sweetness is like. Such indeed are those who try to introduce others to perfection, sanctity and dispassion without having learnt about these things through their own efforts and direct experience. And had God given them even a slight awareness of the things about which they speak, they would at all events see that the truth about them differs greatly from the explanation that they give. Christianity is liable to be misconstrued little by little in this way, and so turned into atheism. But in reality Christianity is like food and drink: the more a man tastes it, the more he longs for it, until his intellect becomes insatiable and uncontrollable. It is as if one were to offer to a thirsty person a sweet drink such that he would want, not simply to slake his thirst, but to go on drinking more and more because of the pleasure it gave him. These things are not to be understood merely in a theoretical way; they must be achieved within the intellect in a mysterious manner through the activity of the Holy Spirit, and only then can they be spoken about.</p>
      <p> 81.  The Gospel commands everyone categorically to do this or not to do that, thus enabling us to become friends of the loving King. "Do not be angry", it says (cf Matt. 5:22), and, "Do not lust' (cf Matt. 5:28); and, 'If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other cheek as well' (Matt. 5:39). St Paul, following closely in</p>
      <p> [V3] 321</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> the steps of these commandments, teaches how the actual work of purification should take place stage by stage, patiently and with long-suffering: first he nourishes the unmstructed with milk (cf 1 Cor. 3:1-2), next he brings them to maturity (cf Eph. 4:14-15), and then to perfection (cf. Heb. 5:12-14). In this way the Gospel forms as it were a complete woolen garment, while St Paul explains clearly how the wool for this garment is to be carded, woven and made up.</p>
      <p> 82.   There are some who have desisted from outward unchastity, fraud, greed and similar iniquity and who on this account regard themselves as saints, when in fact they are far from being true saints. For evil frequently dwells in the intellects of such people, thriving there and creeping around; and after it has destroyed them it leaves them and goes on its way. The saint is he who is sanctified and totally purified in his inner being. One of the brethren was praying with others when he was seized and taken captive by the divine power, and he saw the heavenly Jerusalem and the resplendent dwelling-places there and the boundless and ineffable light. Then he heard a voice saying that this was the place of repose for the righteous. After this, he became very conceited and full of presumption, and fell deeply into sin and was overcome by many evils. If such a man fell, how can anyone say that because he fasts, lives in voluntary exile, gives away all his property and desists from all outward sins, there is nothing wanting for him to be a saint? For pertection consists not in abstention from outward sins but in the total cleansing of the mind.</p>
      <p> 83.   Understanding these things, enter within yourself by keeping watch over your thoughts, and scrutinize closely your intellect, captive and slave to sin as it is. Then discover, still more deeply within you than this, the serpent that nestles in the inner chambers of your soul and destroys you by attacking the most sensitive aspects of your soul. For truly the heart is an immeasurable abyss. If you have destroyed that serpent, have cleansed yourself of all inner lawlessness, and have expelled sin, you may boast in God of your purity; but if not, you should humble yourself because you are still a sinner and in need, and ask Christ to come to you on account of your secret sins. The whole Old and New Testament speaks of purity, and everyone, whether Jew or Greek, should long for purity even though not all can attain it. Purity of heart can be brought about only by Jesus; for He is authentic and absolute Truth, and without this Trath it is impossible to know the truth or to achieve salvation.</p>
      <p> [V3] 322</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>

      <p> Love</p>
      <p> 84.  Having outwardly renounced visible things and given away your goods, you must in the same way also renounce your inner prepossessions and attitudes. If you have acquired worldly wisdom or material knowledge, you must reject it. If you have put your trust in earthly privileges, give them up, humbling and belittling yourself. In this way you can discover what St Paul meant by the 'folly' of the Gospel; for in this folly you will find true wisdom, which resides not in fine words but in the power of the Cross that is active as an actual reality in those found worthy to achieve such wisdom. As St Paul says, Christ's Cross is "a stumbling-block to the Jews and folly to the Greeks, but to those who are saved it is God's power and wisdom' (cf 1 Cor. 1:21-24).</p>
      <p> 85.  Even if you have tasted things celestial and partaken of divine wisdom, and your soul is at rest, do not exalt yourself or grow overconfident, thinking that you have already reached your goal and understand all truth, lest St Paul's words also apply to you: "You are sated already, you are already rich, you have reigned as kings without us. Would that you did reign, so that we could reign with you' (1 Cor. 4:8). Even if you have been given some taste, regard yourself as still not yet a Christian; and do not just think this superficially, but let it be as though planted and established permanently in your mind.</p>
      <p> 86.   A lover of riches is never satisfied, no matter how many possessions he accumulates, but the more he acquires daily, the more his appetite increases; and a person forcibly pulled away from a stream of pure water before he has quenched his thirst feels even more thirsty. In a similar way, once one has experienced the taste of God, one can never be satisfied or have enough of it, but however much one is enriched by this wealth one still feels oneself to be poor. Christians do not set great store by their own lives, but regard themselves rather as rightly set at nought by God and as everyone's</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> servants. God rejoices greatly at this, and takes His repose in the soul because of its humility. If therefore you attain something or are enriched, do not on this account presume you are something or have something. Presumption is an abomination to the Lord, and it was this that originally expelled man from paradise when he heard the serpent say, 'You will be like gods' (Gen. 3:5), and put his trust in this vain hope. Have you not learnt how your God and King, and the very Son of God, emptied Himself and took on the form of a slave (cf Phil. 2:7)? How He became poor, was ranked among criminals, and suffered? If this is what happened to God, do you think that man. formed of flesh and blood, who is but earth and ashes, totally without goodness and wholly depraved, has reason to be proud and boastful? If you have understanding you will recognize that even what you have received from God is not your own, since you were given it by another; and should He think fit, it will certainly be taken away from you again. Attribute, therefore, every blessing to God and every evil to your own weakness.</p>
      <p> 87.   That treasure which St Paul said we hold in pots of clay (cf. 2 Cor. 4:7) is the sanctifying power of the Spirit which while still in the flesh he was enabled to receive. Again St Paul says:'... who has been made by God our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption' (1 Cor. 1:30). He who finds and possesses this supernal treasure of the Spirit can accomplish all righteous acts and works prescribed by the commandments, not only in purity and faultlessly, but also without any suffering or exertion, whereas before he was far from accomplishing them in such a painless way. For no one, however he tries, can truly cultivate spiritual fruits before participating in the Holy Spirit But everyone should put pressure on himself, striving to advance with endurance and faith, and fervently beseeching Christ that he may acquire this heavenly treasure; for in it and through it he can accomplish, as was said, every righteous act in purity and perfectly, without toil or distress.</p>
      <p> 88.   Whenever those who possess in themselves the divine riches of the Spirit take part in spiritual discussion, they draw as it were on their inner treasure-house and share their wealth with their hearers. Those, however, who do not have stored in the sanctuary of their heart the treasure from which springs forth the bounty of divine thoughts, mysteries and inspired words, but who cull what they say from the Scriptures, speak merely from the tip of the tongue; or if</p>

      <p> they have listened to spiritual men, they preen themselves with what others have said, putting it forward as though it were their own and claiming interest on someone else's capital. Their listeners can enjoy what they say without great effort, but they themselves, when they have finished speaking, prove to be like paupers. For they have simply repeated what they have taken from others, without acquiring treasures of their own from which they could first derive pleasure themselves and which they could then communicate profitably to others. For this reason we must first ask God that these true riches may dwell within us, and then we can readily benefit others and speak to them of spiritual matters and divine mysteries. For God's goodness delights to dwell in every believer. As Christ said: 'He who loves Me will be loved by My Father; and I will love him and disclose Myself to him' (John 14:21); and again: 'I and My Father will come to him, and take up Our abode with him' (John 14:23).</p>
      <p> 89. Those who are privileged to become children of God and to have Christ shining forth within them are guided by varied and differing qualities of the Spirit, and are cherished by grace in the secret places of the heart. The seeming joys of the world arc not to be compared with the experience of divine grace in the soul. Those who share in this grace are sometimes filled with an inexpressible and nameless joy and exultation, as if they were at some royal banquet; sometimes they feel like bride and bridegroom delighting together spiritually; and sometimes like bodiless angels, since the body has become so weightless and light that it seems that they are not clothed with it. Sometimes it seems that they are in some realm greatly rejoicing and drunk with the inexpressible drunkenness of the mysteries of the Spirit; and then at other times they are full of grief, weeping and lamenting as they intercede for man's salvation. For, burning with the divine love of the Spirit for all men, they take into themselves the grief of all Adam; and sometimes they are kindled by the Spirit with such untold love and delight that, were it at all possible, they would clasp everyone to their breast, not making any distinction between who is good and who is bad; and sometimes they so disparage themselves that they regard themselves as the least of all men. Now they are consumed with unutterable spiritual joy; and now, like some mighty warrior donning royal armor, marching to war and putting the enemy to flight, they arm themselves with the weapons of the Spirit, attack their invisible enemies and tread them</p>

      <p> Love</p>
      <p> underfoot. Now they are embraced by great tranquility and stillness, peace nourishes them and they experience great</p>
      <p> delight; and now they acquire understanding, divine wisdom and unsearchable spiritual knowledge. In short, it is impossible to describe the grace of Christ by which they are illumined. At other times they can appear to be like any ordinary person. Divine grace, taking in them many different forms, teaches and disciplines the soul so as to present it perfect, pure and spotless to the heavenly Father.</p>
      <p> 90.  All these workings of the Spirit are characteristic of those at a high level and very close to perfection. For these manifold blessings of grace are variously but unceasingly made active in such people by the Spirit, one spiritual energy succeeding another. When the soul attains spiritual perfection, totally purged of all the passions and wholly united and commingled with the Holy Spirit, the Intercessor, in ineffable communion, then through this commingling with the Spirit the soul is itself enabled to become spirit: it becomes all light, all spirit, all joy, repose, exultation, all love, all tenderness, all goodness and kindness. It is as though it had been swallowed up in the virtues belonging to the power of the Holy Spirit as a stone in the depths of the sea is surrounded by water. Totally united in this way to the Holy Spirit, such people are assimilated to Christ Himself, maintaining the virtues of the Spirit immutable in themselves and revealing their fruits to all. Since through the Spirit they have been made inwardly spotless and pure in heart, it is impossible for them to produce outwardly the fruits of evil: always and through all things the fruits of the Spirit will be manifest in them. Such is the state of spiritual perfection, such the fullness of Christ that St Paul exhorts us to attain when he says:  "...  so that you may be filled with the whole fullness of Christ' (cf. Eph. 3:19); and again: "... until we all attain to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ'(Eph. 4:13).</p>
      <p> 91.  There are times when, simply after kneeling down, we find our heart filled with divine energy and our soul delights in the Lord as a bride with the bridegroom: in Isaiah's words, 'As the bridegroom delights in the bride, so will the Lord delight in you' (Isa. 62:5. LXX). A man may be occupied throughout the day, and devote himself for but a single hour to prayer, and still be carried away inwardly by it, entering into the infinite depths of the other world. He experiences then an ineffable and measureless delight; his intellect, wholly suspended and ravished, is overwhelmed, and during the time</p>
      <p> [V3] 326</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> he is in this state he is mindless of every worldly concern. For his thoughts are filled, as we said, with numberless incomprehensible realities and are taken captive by them. In that hour his soul through prayer becomes one with his prayer and is carried away with it.</p>
      <p> 92.   If it is asked whether it is possible for such a person always to be in this state, it should be said that he is never without grace; it is rooted and established in him as though it were part of his nature. Although single, it adapts itself in many ways, according to what is most profitable for him. Sometimes its fire bums in him strongly, sometimes</p>
      <p> faintly; and its light sometimes shines brightly and sometimes diminishes and wanes, always as God wills, even though the lamp itself bums inextinguishably. When it shines more vividly, then the man himself appears even more intoxicated with God's love. Sometimes the fire that bums unceasingly in the heart manifests itself with a more inward and deeper light, so that the whole man, swallowed up by this sweetness and vision, is no longer in himself, but seems to the world like an uncouth fool because of the overpowering love and delight that floods his soul, and because of the deep mysteries which he has been privileged to share. It often happens at such a time that he attains the measure of perfection and is free and secure from all sinfulness. Afterwards, grace contracts in a certain manner, and the veil of the contrary power spreads itself over him.</p>
      <p> 93.   Grace operates in the following way. Suppose that a person attains perfection on ascending to the twelfth step. You reach this level and remain there for a time; but grace again withdraws, so you go down one step, and stand on the eleventh. The wonders of the higher step have been revealed to you, and you have had experience of them. But if you had remained on that step for ever, it would not have been possible for you to submit to the charge and burden of teaching; you would not have been able to hear or speak anything, or to concern yourself with the least thing, but could only have lain in some comer, enraptured and intoxicated. You were not allowed to remain on that final step so that you would have time to devote to the care and instruction of the brethren.</p>
      <p> 94.   If on hearing about the kingdom of heaven we are brought to tears, do not let us be content with these tears, or think that we hear well with our ears or see well with our eyes, and that we need nothing further. For there are other ears, other eyes, other tears, just as there is another mind and another soul. I am referring to the divine</p>
      <p> [V3] 327</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> and heavenly Spirit, that hears and weeps, prays and knows, and that truly carries out God's will. When the Lord promised the great gift of the Spirit to the apostles. He said: 'I am going; but the Intercessor, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in My name, will teach you everything' (John 14:26); and: 'I still have much to tell you, but its burden is more than you can bear now. When, however. He who is the Spirit of truth comes. He will guide you into all the truth' (John 16:12-13). He, therefore, will pray, and He will weep. For, as St Paul says, 'we do not know what to pray for as we should; but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with cries that cannot be uttered' (Rom. 8:26). God's will is clear only to the Spirit. Again, as St Paul says: 'No one but the Spirit of God knows about the things of God' (1 Cor. 2:11). When, as promised, on the day of Pentecost the Paraclete made Himself present and the power of the Holy Spirit came to dwell in the souls of the apostles, the veil of sinfulness was once and for all removed from them, their passions were annulled and the eyes of their heart were opened. Henceforth they were filled with wisdom and made perfect by the Spirit: through Him they knew how to carry out God's will, and through Him they were initiated into all truth, for He directed and reigned in their souls. Thus, when we are brought to tears</p>
      <p> on hearing God's word, let us entreat Christ with unwavering faith and in the expectation that the Spirit, who truly hears and prays according to God's will and purpose, will indeed come to us.</p>
      <p> 95.  There is a certain cloud-like power, fine as air, that lightly covers the intellect; and even though the lamp of grace always bums and shines in a man, as we said, yet this power covers its light like a veil in such a way that he is forced to confess that he is not perfect or wholly free from sin, but is, so to speak, both free and not free. This, certainly, does not happen without God's assent but is, on the contrary, in accordance with divine providence. Sometimes the dividing wall (cf. Eph. 2:14) is loosened and shattered, sometimes it is not entirely broken down. Nor is prayer always equally effective: sometimes grace is kindled more brightly, confers greater blessings, and refreshes more fully, and sometimes it is duller and less strong, as grace itself ordains according to what is of most profit to the person concerned. At certain times I have attained the level of perfection and have tasted and experienced the age to be; but never yet have I known any Christian who is perfect or absolutely free. Even if one</p>
      <p> [V3] 328</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the HomiHes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> finds refreshment in grace and is enabled to share in mysteries and revelations, and experiences the great sweetness of grace, sin still dwells within one. Those who because of surpassing grace and the light that shines within them think that they are perfect and free do so from lack of experience. As 1 have said, I have never yet encountered anyone who was absolutely free; but, having at certain times partially attained that level of which I have spoken, I know from experience what the perfected man is.</p>
      <p> 96.   Whenever you hear about the communion of bridegroom and bride, about dancing, music and feasting, do not take these things in a material or worldly manner: they are spoken of simply by way of illustration, as a condescension to our understanding. For the things they denote are spiritual and inexpressible, indiscernible to corporeal eyes, and these illustrations help holy and faithful souls to perceive what is meant. The communion itself of the Holy Spirit, celestial treasures, the dances and festivals of the angels-these things are clear only to those who have experience of them; to the uninitiated they are totally beyond comprehension. Thus you must listen with reverence to what is said about them, until through faith you are enabled to attain them; then you will know, with the actual experience of the soul's eyes, in what blessings and mysteries the souls of Christians can share even during this present life. When in the resurrection their body becomes spiritual, it too is enabled to attain, behold and, so to speak, grasp these things.</p>
      <p> 97.  When our soul's own intrinsic qualities and fruits-prayer, love, faith, vigilance, fasting and the other expressions of the virtues-mingle and commune in the fellowship of the Spirit, they effuse a rich perfume, like burning incense. At the same time it then becomes easy for us to live in accordance with God's will, whereas without the Holy Spirit this is impossible, as we have already said. Before a woman is married she acts in accordance with</p>
      <p> her own will and desires; but once married she lives under the direction of her husband, abandoning her self-will. Similarly the soul has its own will, and its own laws and activities; but when it becomes worthy of uniting with Christ the heavenly bridegroom, it submits to His law and is obedient no longer to its own will but to that of Christ.</p>
      <p> 98. The wedding garment about which Christ speaks (cf. Matt. 22:11-12) signifies the grace of the Holy Spirit: the man who is not</p>
      <p> [V3] 329</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>

      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> worthy of wearing it has no part in the celestial marriage and in the spiritual wedding-feast.</p>
      <p> 99.  We should eagerly drink spiritual wine and become drunk with a sober-minded drunkenness so that, just as those glutted with ordinary wine become more talkative, we too, brim-full with this spiritual wine, may speak of the divine mysteries. Thy cup has made me drunk as with the strongest wine', says the psalmist (Ps. 23:5. LXX).</p>
      <p> 100.  The soul that is 'poor in spirit' (Matt. 5:3) is aware of its own wounds, perceives the encompassing darkness of the passions, and always calls upon the Lord for deliverance. It endures suffering, and does not delight in any of the good things of this world, but seeks out only the good doctor and entrusts itself to His treatment. How can the wounded soul become fair and seemly, and fit to live with Christ, except by truly recognizing its wounds and poverty and by recovering the state in which it was originally created? If it does not take pleasure in the wounds and weals of the passions, or defend its faults, the Lord will not call it to account for these things, but will come and heal it, restoring its dispassion and its incorruptible beauty. Only it must not deliberately associate with past acts of passion or give its consent to the passions that are still active within it; but with all its strength it must call upon the Lord, so that through His Holy Spirit it may be granted liberation from all the passions. Such is the soul that is called blessed; but alas for the soul that is unaware of its wounds and that in its endless sinfulness and obduracy does not think that it has anything evil within it: the good doctor will not visit it or heal it, since it does not seek Him out or have any concern for its wounds, because it thinks it is well and in good health. As the Lord said: 'It is not the healthy that need a doctor, but the sick' (Matt. 9:12).</p>
      <p> 101.  Truly blessed and zealous for life and for surpassing joy are those who through fervent faith and virtuous conduct receive consciously and expenentially the knowledge of the celestial mysteries of the Spirit and whose citizenship is in heaven (cf Phil. 3:20). Clearly they excel all other men; for who among the powerful or the wise or the prudent could ascend to heaven while still on earth, and perform spiritual works there and have sight of the beauty of the Spirit'? Such a person may appear poor, utterly poor, may be regarded as nothing and be totally unrecognized by his neighbors; but falling on his face before the Lord he rises to heaven under the guidance of</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> the Spirit and with assurance of soul, dehghting in his mind with its wonders, occupying himseh" there, hving there, having his citizenship there, as St Paul puts it. For he says: 'Our citizenship is in heaven' (Phil. 3:20); and he also says: 'The eye has not seen, and the ear has not heard, and man's heart has not grasped the things that God has prepared for those who love Him. But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit' (1 Cor. 2:9-10). These are the truly wise and powerful, these are the noble and the prudent.</p>
      <p> 102. Even apart from these celestial gifts distinguishing the saints from other living people, there are further ways of recognizing their superiority. For instance, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, summoned to him all the peoples to worship the image that he had set up (cf Dan. 3:1-30). But God in His wisdom so disposed things that the virtue of three children should be made known to everyone and should teach everyone that there is one true God, who dwells in the heavens. Three children, captive and deprived of their liberty, spoke out boldly before him; and while everyone else, in great fear, worshipped the image, and even if not convinced did not dare to say anything, but was virtually speechless, like beasts dragged along by the nose, these children behaved very differently. They did not want their refusal to worship the image to go unrecognized or to escape notice, but they declared in the hearing of all: 'We do not worship your gods, 0 king, nor will we bow down before the golden image that you have set up.' Yet the terrible furnace into which they were cast as punishment was not a furnace for them and did not manifest its normal function; but as if reverencing the children it kept them free from harm. And everyone, including the king himself, through them recognized the true God. Not only those on earth, but the angelic choirs themselves were amazed at these children. For the angels are not absent when the saints perform their acts of courage, but keep them company, as St Paul confirms when he says: 'We have become a spectacle... to angels and men' (1 Cor. 4:9). Another example of how saints are to be distinguished is that of Elijah who, though but a single man, prevailed over a great number of false prophets when the fire came down from heaven (cf. 1 Kgs. 18:38). And Moses prevailed over all Egypt and Pharaoh the tyrant (cf. Exod. chs. 5-13). Similarly Lot (cf. Gen. ch. 19) and Noah (cf. Gen. chs. 6-7) and many others, despite their apparent weakness, overcame many powerful and notable people.</p>
      <p> [V3] 331</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> 103.   Unless something of a different nature comes to its help, every phenomenon retains its inherent imperfection and deficiency. Thus God's inexpressible wisdom has shown forth in symbols and images through visible things that human nature in itself cannot manifest the full glory of the virtues and the spiritual beauty of holiness unless it has the assistance of God's helping hand. If the earth abides by itself, not receiving the farmer's attention and the assistance of rain and sun, it is unfit and incapable of bearing fruit; and every house would be filled with darkness but for the light of the sun, which is not of its own nature; and other things are in a similar state. In the same way, human nature, which in itself is powerless to produce the fruits of the virtues in their full perfection, needs the spiritual husbandman of our souls; in other words, it needs the Spirit of Christ, and this Spirit is of a totally different nature from our own, for we are created while He is uncreated. Skillfully tilling the hearts of the faithful so that they surrender their whole will to Him, He enables them to produce perfect spiritual fruits, while He makes His light shine in the soul's dwelling-place that has been darkened by the passions.</p>
      <p> 104.  The warfare and struggle in which Christians are engaged is twofold. First, it is against visible things, for these excite, titillate and entice the soul to become attached to them and to take pleasure in them. And, second, it is against the principalities and powers of the terrible lord of this world (cf. Eph. 6:12).</p>
      <p> 105.  The glory that shone from the face of Moses (cf. Exod. 34:29-30) was a prefiguring of the true glory of the Holy Spirit. Just as it was impossible then for anyone to gaze at it, so now the darkness of the passions cannot bear the same glory shining in the souls of Christians, but is put to flight, repulsed by its brilliance.</p>
      <p> 106.  The truly sincere and devout Christian who has tasted the sweetness of divine things, whose soul is infused and mingled with grace, and who has entrasted his whole being to the purposes of grace, hates every worldly thing. Whether it is gold or silver, honor or glory, esteem or praise, or anything else, he is superior to it, and none of these things is able to captivate him; for he has experienced other riches and another honor and glory, his soul is nourished by an incorruptible delight, and through the fellowship of the Spirit he has full and conscious assurance.</p>
      <p> 107.  In understanding, spiritual knowledge and discrimination, such a person differs as much from other men as an intelligent</p>
      <p> [V3] 332</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> herdsman differs from witless cattle; for he partakes of another Spirit and another intellect, of another understanding, and of a wisdom that is not the wisdom of this world. As St Paul says: 'We proclaim wisdom to those who are perfect; not the wisdom of this world, or of the doomed rulers of this world; but we proclaim the secret</p>
      <p> wisdom of God' (cf 1 Cor. 2:6-7). For this reason, such a person differs in everything from those who are dominated by the spirit of the world, however intelhgent or wise they are. Again as St Paul says (cf. 1 Cor. 2:15), he judges all men, he knows from what source he speaks and where he stands and among whom he is. Those dominated by the spirit of the world, on the other hand, have no power to know and judge him; this is possible only for one who possesses as he does the Spirit of divinity. As St Paul puts it: 'We interpret spiritual things to those who possess the Spirit. The worldly man does not accept spiritual things: they are folly to  him...  But the spiritual man judges all things, while he is himself judged by no one' (1 Cor. 2:13-15).</p>
      <p> 108.  It is altogether impossible to attain the Holy Spirit unless you alienate yourself from all the things of this world and dedicate yourself to the pursuit of Christ's love. The intellect must divest itself of every material concern and give its attention solely to achieving this one goal, thus becoming worthy of uniting in one spirit with Christ. As St Paul writes: 'He who cleaves to the Lord becomes one spirit with Him' (1 Cor. 6:17). The soul that is wholly attached to some worldly thing like riches or glory or natural affection is not able to escape and transcend the darkness of the powers of evil.</p>
      <p> 109.   Truly sincere and devout souls cannot endure even a slight slackening of their longing for the Lord but, with their attention riveted entirely to His Cross, they seek to grow ever more fully conscious of their spiritual progress. Wounded by their longing and, so to speak, hungering for the righteousness of the virtues and the illumination of the Holy Spirit, they place no reliance on themselves and do not think they are anything even though they have been vouchsafed divine mysteries and partake of celestial felicity and grace. But the more they are enabled by grace to receive spiritual gifts, the more insatiable and diligent becomes their pursuit of heavenly realities; and the more they are aware of their spiritual progress, the more fervent grows their desire to participate in these realities. Spiritually enriched, they feel themselves to be poor. As Scripture</p>
      <p> [V3] 333</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> puts it: 'Those who eat Me will still be hungry and those who drink Me will still be thirsty' (Ecclus. 24:21).</p>
      <p> 110.  Such souls are not only granted complete freedom from the passions but also perfectly acquire the illumination and communion of the Holy Spirit in the fullness of grace. But souls that are sluggish and indolent and do not seek in this life, and while still in the flesh, to achieve through patient endurance and long-suffering the heart's sanctrfication not just partially but totally, cannot hope to commune in the Holy Spirit with full consciousness and assurance, or to be delivered from the passions of evil through the Spirit. Such sluggish and indolent souls, even though granted divine grace, are deceived by evil and cease to trouble themselves further: because they have received grace and enjoy the solace and spiritual sweetness that it confers, they grow complacent, not mortifying their heart or humbling their thought, and not thirsting and aspiring after the full measure of dispassion. Content</p>
      <p> with this slight solace of grace, they progress not in humility but in self-inflation, and are sometimes stripped even of the gift they have been given. With the truly devout soul it is different: even if it practices a thousand works of righteousness, crushes the body with extreme fasting and the most demanding vigils, and is vouchsafed various gifts, revelations and mysteries of the Spirit, it is so modest that it feels it has not yet even embarked on the spiritual path or acquired any of the virtues; and it craves insatiably for divine love.</p>
      <p> 111.   No one can attain such a state as this swiftly or easily: it can only be reached by way of many hardships and struggles, after much time and diligence, testing and temptation, thus bringing one to the full measure of dispassion. It is he who has thus been sifted by every kind of suffering and tribulation, and who has courageously endured all the trials of evil, that is finally found worthy to receive the great blessings, gifts and riches of the Spirit and to inherit the kingdom of heaven.</p>
      <p> 112.  The soul that has not yet acquired this citizenship in heaven and is not yet conscious of the heart's sanctification should be full of sorrow and should implore Christ fervently, that it may attain this blessing as well as the energy of the Spirit that is manifest in the intellect in the form of inexpressible visions. According to ecclesiastical law, those who are conquered by bodily sins are initially excluded from communion by the priest; then, when they have</p>
      <p> [V3] 334</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> shown the appropriate repentance, they are allowed to communicate once more. Those, however, who have not stumbled but have lived in purity may advance to priesthood and take their place within the sanctuary, officiating before the Lord at the Liturgy. We can apply the same distinction to inner communion in the Holy Spirit. Speaking of this, St Paul says: 'The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God the Father, and communion in the Holy Spirit...' (2 Cor. 15:14). Thus the Holy Trinity dwells in the pure soul, divine grace assisting. It dwells in the soul, not as it is in itself, for the Trinity is infinite and cannot be embraced by any created thing, but according to man's capacity and receptivity. Whenever the intellect turns aside from the pursuit of God's will and purpose, and grieves the Spirit, it is cast out and excommunicated from spiritual felicity: God's grace and love, and all the energy of the Holy Spirit, withdraw, and the intellect is delivered up to afflictions, trials and evil powers until the soul again walks in the path of the Spirit. When through confession and self-abasement it has shown that it is repentant, then it is again enabled to receive the visitation of grace and celestial felicity, even more than before. But should the soul not grieve the Spirit in any way, but live acceptably, rejecting every evil thought and cleaving continually to the Lord, rightly and fittingly will it go forward, receiving unutterable gifts and advancing from glory to glory and from peace to greater peace. Finally, when it has attained the full measure of the Christian life, it will be ranged among the perfect liturgists and faultless ministers of Christ in His eternal kingdom.</p>
      <p> 113.  Visible things are figures and reflections of invisible things. Thus the visible church figures and reflects the church of the heart, the visible priest the true priest of Christ's grace; and so on. In the visible church, if the readings, psalms and other parts of the appointed rite do not succeed one another in the proper sequence, then it is not possible for the priest to proceed with the celebration of the divine sacrament of Christ's body and blood; and even if the rest of the order of the service is properly carried out, but the mystical thanksgiving of the sacrifice is not offered by the priest and there is no communion in the body of Christ, then the ecclesiastical rite has not been fulfilled and again the celebration of the sacrament is deficient. One must look on the life of the Christian in a similar way. He may have fasted, kept vigils, chanted the psalms, carried out every ascetic practice and acquired every virtue; but if the mystic working of the</p>
      <p> [V3] 335</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the HomiHes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> Spirit has not been consummated by grace with full consciousness and spiritual peace on the altar of his heart, all his ascetic practice is ineffectual and virtually fruitless, for the joy of the Spirit is not mystically active in his heart.</p>
      <p> 114.   Fasting is good and so are vigils, ascetic practice and voluntary exile. But all these things are but the start, the prelude to the citizenship of heaven, so that it is altogether senseless to put one's trust merely in them. It sometimes happens that we attain a certain state of grace but that evil, as we said above, lying in ambush within us, plays a trick on us: it deliberately withdraws and remains inactive, thus making us think that our intellect has been cleansed. In this way it produces in us the self-conceit of perfection, whereupon it stealthily attacks us and carries us down to the lowest depths of the earth. It often happens that young soldiers or brigands resort to tricks against the enemy: they set up ambushes and, catching their opponents unexpectedly from behind and surrounding them, they slaughter them. If that is what they do, then how much more skilled must evil be, that has dedicated itself for thousands of years to the crucial task of destroying souls. It knows exactly how to devise such ambushes in the secret places of the heart, sometimes keeping quiet and inactive deliberately in order to entice the soul into the self-conceit of perfection. Indeed, the cardinal rule of the Christian life is not to put one's trust in acts of righteousness even if one practices all of them, or to imagine that one has done anything great; and even if one participates in grace, one must not think that one has achieved anything or reached the goal. On the contrary, one should then hunger and thirst, grieve and weep even more, and be totally contrite in heart.</p>
      <p> 115.  The spiritual state is like some royal palace that possesses many exterior courts, vestibules and outer residences; then there are various inner buildings, usually housing the royal robes and the treasure; and then, yet farther within, are the king's living quarters. Someone still in the outer courts and apartments may think he has reached the inner chambers, but he would be wrong. The same is true where the spiritual life is concerned. Those struggling against greed and sleep, and continually occupied with psalms and prayers, should not think that they</p>
      <p> have already attained the final place of rest: they are still in the exterior courts and vestibules, and have not even reached the place where the royal robes and treasure are kept. Even if</p>
      <p> [V3] 336</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the HomiHes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> they are found worthy of some spiritual grace, again this should not deceive them into thinking that they have attained their goal. They must examine to see whether they have found the treasure in the pot of clay (cf. 2 Cor. 4:7), whether they have put on the purple robe of the Spirit, whether they have seen the king and are at peace.</p>
      <p> Again, our soul has depths and many faculties. When sin insinuates itself, it lays hold of all these faculties and all the heart's thoughts. Then we ask for the grace of the Spirit: it is granted and perhaps embraces two of the soul's faculties. If we lack experience we fancy that this grace we have invoked has laid hold of all the soul's faculties and that sin has been completely uprooted; we do not realize that most of our soul is still subject to sin. For, as has been shown many times, it is possible for grace to be ceaselessly active, as the eye is in the body, and yet for the evil that despoils the mind to coexist with it. Hence, if we do not know how to discriminate, we fancy that we have attained something great and begin to think highly of ourselves, deluding ourselves that we have reached the final stage of purification, though this is very far from the truth. As has been said, one of the devil's ploys is to withdraw deliberately for a certain time and to remain inactive, thus promoting the conceit of perfection in those pursuing the spiritual way. But does the man who plants a vineyard immediately gather grapes? Or does he who sows seeds in the earth at once reap the harvest? Does the new-bom child attain maturity straight away? Think how Jesus Christ, the Son of God and God Himself, descended from the heights of glory to suffering, dishonor, crucifixion and death; and how because of this self-abasement He was taken up again and set at the right hand of the Father. But the evil serpent, that first sowed in Adam the desire for divinity (cf. Gen. 3:5), dragged him down into disgrace through this presumption. Think about these things and try to protect yourself as much as you can, keeping your heart always in a state of humility and contrition.</p>

      <p> 116.  When you hear that Christ descended into hell in order to deliver the souls dwelling there, do not think that what happens now is very different. The heart is a tomb and there our thoughts and our intellect are buried, imprisoned in heavy darkness. And so Christ comes to the souls in hell that call upon Him, descending, that is to say, into the depths of the heart; and there He commands death to release the imprisoned souls that call upon Him, for He has power to deliver us. Then, lifting up the heavy stone that oppresses the soul, and opening the tomb. He resurrects us - for we were truly dead - and releases our imprisoned soul from its lightless prison.</p>
      <p> 117.  It often happens that Satan will insidiously commune with you in your heart and say: 'Think of the evil you have done; your soul is full of lawlessness, you are weighed down by many grievous sins.' Do not let him deceive you when he does this and do not be led to despair on the pretext that you are being humble. After gaining admission through the fall evil has the power to commune at all times with the soul, as man to man, and so to suggest sinful actions to it. You should answer it: 'I have God's written assurance, for He says: "I desire, not the sinner's death, but that he should return through repentance and live'" (cf Ezek. 33:11). What was the purpose of His descent to earth except to save sinners, to bring light to those in darkness and life to the dead?'</p>
      <p> 118.  Just as the power of evil works by persuasion, not by compulsion, so does divine grace. In this way our liberty and free will are preserved. If a man commits sins when he is subject to the devil, he himself pays the penalty, not the devil, since he was impelled to evil not by force but by his own will. It is the same where a good action is concerned: grace does not ascribe this action to itself but to the man, giving him the credit for it, since he is the cause of the goodness that befalls him. Grace does not make a man incapable of sin</p>

      <p> by forcibly and compulsonly laying hold of his will but, though present, allows him freedom of choice, so as to make it clear whether the man's own will inclines to virtue or to evil. For the law looks not to man's nature but to his free power of choice, which is capable of turning towards either good or evil.</p>
      <p> 119.  One must guard the soul and not allow it to commune with impure pernicious thoughts. Just as the body is defiled through intercourse with another body, so the soul is corrupted through coupling with evil and polluted thoughts, assenting to them and uniting with them. Not simply thoughts of cunning and unchastity, but of every vice: unbelief, guile, self-esteem, anger, envy, contentiousness and so on. That is what St Paul means when he says: 'Let us cleanse ourselves from all pollution of the flesh and spirit' (2 Cor. 7:1). For corruption and unchastity work also through shameless thoughts in the hidden places of the soul; and just as God will destroy the person who destroys</p>
      <p> His temple, which is the body (cf 1 Cor. 3:17), so the person who corrupts his soul and intellect by assenting to shameless thoughts and uniting with them is liable to punishment. Just as one should guard the body against visible sins, so one should guard the soul, which is the bride of Christ, against shameless thoughts. 'I betrothed you to Christ, hoping to present you to Him as a pure virgin to her sole husband', writes St Paul (2 Cor. 11:2). 'Guard your heart with all diligence, for on this depends the outcome of-life', says Scripture (Prov. 4:23); and: 'Crooked thoughts separate us from God' (Wisd. 1:3).</p>
      <p> 120.  Let everyone call his own soul to account, examining it and testing it to see to what it is attached; and should he find that his heart does not conform to God's laws, let him try with all his strength to keep not only the body but also the intellect free from corruption and involvement with evil thoughts - if, that is to say, he wishes God in His purity to take up His dwelling within him according to His promise. For God has promised to dwell within souls that are pure and devoted to what is beautiful and good (cf. 2 Cor. 6:16).</p>
      <p> 121.  The prudent farmer first clears his land of brambles before sowing it with seed. Similarly, the man who aspires to receive from God the seed of grace must first clear the earth of his heart, so that when the seed of the Spirit falls it may yield a good and abundant harvest. If he does not first cleanse himself from 'all pollution of the flesh and spirit' (2 Cor. 7:1), he remains flesh and blood and is far from the realm of life (cf. 1 Cor. 15:50).</p>

      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> 122.   One must watch very carefully and in every direction for the enemy's trickery, guile and malice. Speaking through St Paul, the Holy Spirit says: 'I became all things to all men so as to save everyone' (cf. 1 Cor. 9:22); and in the same way the enemy tries to become all things so as to bring everyone to destruction. He pretends to pray with those who pray, so as to cheat them into self-conceit by making them think they have attained the state of prayer. He fasts with those who fast, with the purpose again of filling them with self-conceit because they have succeeded in fasting. With those who understand the Scriptures he tries to do the same, hoping to lead them astray by making them claim to possess spiritual knowledge. To those who have been granted a vision of the light, he pretends to offer the same kind of vision, transforming himself into 'an angel of light' (2 Cor. 11:14), so that through this simulation of the true light he may seduce them to him. In short, he uses every kind of deceit and adapts himself to every kind of appearance, so that by assuming the likeness of what is good he becomes a plausible agent of destruction. 'We destroy evil thoughts and all the self-esteem that exalts itself against the knowledge of God', says St Paul (2 Cor. 10:5). You see to what limits the impostor carries his defiance, wanting to cast down even those who have already attained a divine knowledge of the truth. Hence we must guard the heart with all diligence and beseech God for much understanding, so that He enables us to discern the devil's wiliness, to cultivate and train the intellect in understanding, to attend continually to our thoughts, and to conform ourselves to His will. There is no work greater</p>
      <p> than this. 'Praise and magnificence are His works', as the psalmist writes (Ps. 111:3. LXX).</p>
      <p> 123.  The devout soul, even if it practices all the virtues, ascribes everything to God and nothing to itself. God, on the other hand, when He sees its sound and healthy understanding and knowledge, attributes everything to the soul, and rewards it as though it had achieved everything through its own efforts. He does this in spite of the fact that, if He were to bring us to judgment, no true righteousness would be found in us. For material possessions and everything that man regards as valuable and through which he is able to do good, the earth and whatever is in it, all belong to God. Man's body and soul, and even his very being, are his only by grace. What, then, is left to him that he can call his own, by virtue of which he can pride himself or vindicate himself? Yet when the soul recognizes - what is</p>
      <p> [V3] 340</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> indeed the truth-that all its good actions for God's sake, together with all its understanding and knowledge, are to be ascribed to God alone and that everything should be attributed to Him, then God accepts this as the greatest gift that man can make, as the offering that is most precious in His eyes.</p>
      <p> 124.  When a woman comes to live and share her life with a man, all that each has is held in common. They share one house, a single being and existence. And the woman is mistress not only of the man's possessions but also of his very body: as St Paul says, 'The man does not have power over his own body, but the woman does' (1 Cor. 7:4). Similarly the soul, in its true and ineffable communion with Christ, becomes one spirit with Him (cf 1 Cor. 6:17). It necessarily follows that, since the soul has become His bride, it is as it were mistress of all His untold treasures. For there is no doubt that, when God joins Himself to the soul, all that He has belongs also to the soul, whether it be world, life, death, angels, principalities, things present or things to come (cf. Rom. 8:38).</p>
      <p> 125.  While the Israelites were well pleasing to the Lord-though they were never as they should have been, but at least while they seemed to have some faith in Him-the Lord went before them in a pillar of fire and in a pillar of cloud (cf. Exod. 13:21), He made the sea go back (cf. Exod. 14:21), and conferred on them a thousand other wonders. But when they lost their love for God, then they were handed over to their enemies and were sold into bitter slavery. Something similar happens in the case of the soul. When through grace it has come to know God and has been cleansed of its many past stains, then it is granted gifts of grace; but when it does not ceaselessly maintain befitting love for the celestial bridegroom, it falls away from the life in which it shared; for the enemy can attack even those who have attained a high level of grace. Let us struggle, therefore, as much as we can, and guard our life with fear and trembling. In particular, those who have come to share in the Spirit of Christ should be careful not to grieve the Spirit by acting negligently in any way, great or small. Just as there is joy in heaven over one sinner who repents (cf. Luke 15:7), so there is grief over one soul that falls away from eternal life.</p>
      <p> 126.   When a soul has become worthy of grace, then God will give it spiritual knowledge, understanding and discrimination to the degree that is profitable for it. God will give these things when the</p>

      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> soul asks for them, so that it may be enabled acceptably to serve the Spirit that it has received, and not be seduced by evil, or led into error through ignorance, or perverted by negligence and lack of fear into doing something contrary to His will.</p>
      <p> 127.   The energy of the passions-which is the worldly spirit of delusion, darkness and sin-fills the man in whom it dwells with concern for things of the flesh. The energy and power of the Spirit of light, on the other hand, dwell in the saintly man, as St Paul indicates when he says: 'Do you seek a proof that Christ is speaking through me?' (2 Cor. 13:3); and: '1 no longer live, but Christ lives in me' (Gal. 2:20); and: 'Those of you who have been baptized in Christ have clothed yourselves in Christ' (Gal. 3:27). And Christ affirms the same when He says: '1 and My Father will come and make Our dwelling with him' (cf John 14:23). To those who are found worthy of them these things happen, not unperceived or without manifesting their activity, but with power and trath. The Law with its implacable sentence first brought men to repentance, placing them under an unbearably heavy yoke without being able to hold out the least help. But what the Law cannot offer, the power of the Spirit can provide: 'For what the Law could not do because it was enfeebled through our fleshlmess, God has done', says St Paul (Rom. 8:3). Since Christ's coming the door of grace has been opened to those who truly believe, and they have been given the power of God and the energy of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> 128.  Christ first sent the gift of the natural goodness of the Holy Spirit to His disciples (cf. Acts 2:3). Thereafter the divine power, overshadowing all the faithful and dwelling in their souls, healed the passions of sin and delivered them from darkness and spiritual death. For until then the soul was wounded and captive, held fast in the obscurity of sin. Indeed, even now the soul is still in darkness if Christ has not yet come to dwell in it, and if the power of the Holy Spirit is not active in it, filling it with all strength and assurance. But to those on whom the grace of the divine Spirit has descended, coming to dwell in the deepest levels of their intellect, Christ is as the soul. As St Paul says: 'He who cleaves to the Lord becomes one spirit with Him' (1 Cor. 6:17). And as the Lord Himself says: 'As 1 and Thou are one, so may they be one in Us' (cf. John 17:21). What blessing and goodness has human nature received, abased as it was by the power of evil! But when the soul is entangled in the depravity of the passions, it becomes as though one with it, and even though it possesses its own</p>

      <p> will it cannot do what it wants to do. As St Paul says: 'What I do is not what I want to do' (Rom. 7:15). On the other hand, how much closer is the union it enjoys when one with God's will, when His power is conjoined with it, sanctifying it and making it worthy of Him. For then in truth the soul becomes as the soul of the Lord, submitting willingly and consciously to the power of the Holy Spirit and no longer acting in accordance with its own will. 'What can separate us from the love of Christ' (Rom. 8:35), when the soul is united to the Holy Spirit?</p>
      <p> 129. He who wants to be an imitator of Christ, so that he too may be called a son of God, bom of the Spirit, must above all bear courageously and patiently the afflictions he encounters, whether these be bodily illnesses, slander and vilification from men, or attacks from the unseen spirits. God in His providence allows souls to be tested by various afflictions of this kind, so that it may be revealed which of them truly loves Him. All the patriarchs, prophets, apostles and martyrs from the beginning of time traversed none other than this narrow road of trial and affliction, and it was by doing this that they fulfilled God's will. 'My son,' says Scripture, 'if you come to serve the Lord, prepare your soul for trial, set your heart straight, and patiently endure' (Ecclus. 2:1-2). And elsewhere it is said: 'Accept everything that comes as good, knowing that nothing occurs without God willing it.' Thus the soul that wishes to do God's will must strive above all to acquire patient endurance and hope. For one of the tricks of the devil is to make us listless at times of affliction, so that we give up our hope in the Lord. God never allows a soul that hopes in Him to be so oppressed by trials that it is put to utter confusion. As St Paul writes: 'God is to be trusted not to let us be tried beyond our strength, but with the trial He will provide a way out, so that we are able to bear it' (1 Cor. 10:13). The devil harasses the soul not as much as he wants but as much as God allows him to. Men know what burden may be placed on a mule, what on a donkey, and what on a camel, and load each beast accordingly; and the potter knows how long he must leave the pots in the fire, so that they are not cracked by staying in it too long or rendered useless by being taken out of it before they are properly fired. If human understanding extends this far, must not God be much more aware, infinitely more aware, of the</p>

      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> degree of trial it is right to impose on each sod, so that it becomes tried and true, fit for the kingdom of heaven?</p>
      <p> 130.  Hemp, unless it is well beaten, cannot be worked into fine yam, while the more it is beaten and carded the finer and more serviceable it becomes. And a freshly molded pot that has not been fired is of no use to man. And a child not yet proficient in worldly skills cannot build, plant, sow seed or perform any other worldly task. In a similar manner it often happens through the Lord's goodness that souls, on account of their childlike innocence, participate in divine grace and are filled with the sweetness and repose of the Spirit; but because they have not yet been tested, and have not been tried by the various afflictions of the evil spirits, they are still immature and not yet fit for the kingdom of heaven. As the apostle says: 'If you have not been disciplined you are bastards and not sons' (Heb. 12:8). Thus trials and afflictions are laid upon a man in the way that is best for him, so as to make his soul stronger and more mature; and if the soul endures them to the end with hope in the Lord it cannot fail to attain the promised reward of the Spirit and deliverance from the evil passions.</p>
      <p> 131.  It was by experiencing many torments and enduring even to the point of death that the martyrs earned their crowns of glory; and the greater and more grievous the suffering, the greater their glory and the more intimate their communion with God. In the same way, when our souls are undergoing afflictions-whether they come in a visible form from men, or in an intellectual form by means of evil thoughts, or derive from bodily illnesses-if we endure them to the end, we will gain the same crowns as the martyrs and will enjoy the same intimacy with God. For we will have sustained the martyrdom of afflictions produced by the evil spirits, as the martyrs sustained those that came through men; and the greater the diabolic afflictions we have endured, the greater the glory we receive from God, not only in the future but also in this present life through the grace of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> 132.   Since the road leading to immortal life is extremely narrow and full of affliction, and on account of this there are few who traverse it (cf. Matt. 7:14), we must staunchly endure every trial of the devil, awaiting with hope our heavenly reward. For, however great the afflictions we suffer, what are they compared with the promised future reward, or with the grace of the Holy Spirit that</p>
      <p> [V3] 344</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> visits souls even in this present life, or with the deliverance that we have received from the obscurity of evil passions, or with the enormous debts we owe because of our sins'? As St Paul says: 'The sufferings of this present life are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us' (Rom. 8:18). Hence we must patiently endure everything for the Lord's sake, like brave soldiers dying for our King. Yet why is it that when we gave our attention to the world and to worldly things we did not fall into such distress, but now that we have come to serve God we suffer these manifold trials? It is because the devil, jealous of the blessings stored up for us, tries to make our souls sluggish and lazy, lest by enduring these afflictions for Christ's sake in the way that He wishes we should be granted our reward. No matter how much the devil arms himself against us, if we endure his attacks</p>
      <p> courageously, with Christ's help all his designs against us will be brought to nothing. For we have Jesus as our defender and ally: let us keep in mind that He too passed through this present life vilified, persecuted and reviled, and that finally He was made perfect by a shameful death on the Cross (cf. Heb. 2:10).</p>
      <p> 133.  If we want to endure every affliction and trial readily, let us long to die for Christ and let us keep this death continually before our eyes. For we have been commanded to take up the cross and to follow Him (cf. Matt. 16:24); and this means that we must be prepared and ready for death. If we have this disposition we will endure every affliction, visible and invisible, much more easily. How can he who is anxious to the for Christ's sake have any difficulty in putting up with suffering and distress? Yet we think afflictions are hard to bear, for we do not keep death for Christ's sake before us or rivet our mind always on Christ. But if we want to share His inheritance we must be willing to share His sufferings with an equal zeal. Those who love the Lord may be recognized by the fact that because of their hope in Him they bear every affliction that comes, not simply courageously but also wholeheartedly.</p>
      <p> 134.  If we want to draw close to Christ we must first drag ourselves forcibly towards the good, even though our heart may not wish it. 'The kingdom of heaven is subjected to violence, and the violent take it by force', said the Lord (Matt. 11:12). And He also said: 'Strive to enter through the narrow gate' (Luke 13:24). We must, then, force ourselves even against our will towards virtue, towards love when we lack love, towards gentleness when we have</p>
      <p> [V3]345</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the HomiHes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> need of it, towards sympathy of heart and compassion, towards patience in the face of insult and contempt, and steadfastness in the face of mockery, if we have not yet acquired the habit of these things, and towards prayer if we still have not attained spiritual prayer. If God sees us struggling in this way and forcibly dragging ourselves towards the good even when our heart seems to oppose it. He will bestow true prayer on us, will give us compassion, patience, forbearance, and in general will fill us with all the fruits of the Spirit. Indeed, if a person lacking the other virtues forces himself towards, say, prayer alone, so that he may possess the grace of prayer, but at the same time is not apathetic or indifferent with regard to gentleness, humility, love and all the other virtues that ennoble our soul, including firmness of faith and trust in Christ, then sometimes the Holy Spirit gives him, at least in part, the grace of prayer for which he has asked, and fills him with gladness and repose. But he is still bereft of all the other virtues, because he has not forced himself to acquire them, nor has he besought Christ for them. Moreover, we should force ourselves, even unwillingly, not only towards the virtues mentioned, asking to receive them from God, but also towards the power to judge useless and wholly idle words, unworthy of being spoken; for we should assiduously meditate upon God's words both when we speak and in our heart. And we must also force ourselves not to get angry or to shout-'Rid yourselves of all bitterness, anger and shouting', the apostle says (Eph. 4:31); not to defame or to</p>
      <p> judge anyone, not to become puffed up. When the Lord sees us putting pressure on ourselves and dragging ourselves along forcibly. He will assuredly give us the strength to do painlessly and easily what it was impossible for us to do before, even with force, because of the evil dwelling within us. And then the whole practice of the virtues becomes as it were part of our nature, since henceforward the Lord, as He promised, comes and dwells in us, as we equally dwell in Him; and in Him we fulfill the commandments with great ease.</p>
      <p> 135.  When someone forces himself only towards prayer, while he does not exert or force himself with regard to humility, love, gentleness and all the other interdependent virtues, the result is much as follows. Sometimes in response to his entreaty divine grace visits him, because God in His goodness and love does respond to the petitions of those who call upon Him; but because he has not habituated and trained himself in the practice of the other virtues,</p>
      <p> [V3] 346</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> either he lapses from the grace he has received, falling through self-conceit, or else he does not dedicate himself to this grace and grow in it. The abode and resting-place of the Holy Spirit is humility, love, gentleness and the other holy commandments of Christ. If, therefore, a person desires to grow and to attain perfection by acquiring all these virtues, he must initially force himself to acquire and must establish himself in the first-mat is to say, in prayer-wrestling and striving with his heart to make it receptive and obedient to God. If he first forces himself in this way, completely subduing the resistance of his soul, through good habit making it obedient to him so that it joins with him in his prayer and supplication, then the grace of prayer that he has been given by the Spirit grows and flourishes, reposing upon him together with the humility, love and blessed gentleness which he has also sought to acquire. So, then, the Spirit grants him these virtues as well, teaching him the true humility, genuine love and gentleness that he has previously impelled himself to ask for. Thus he grows and is made perfect in the Lord, and is found worthy of the kingdom of heaven. For the humble man never falls: where, indeed, can he fall to if he regards himself as lower than all things? While lofty-mmdedness leads to great humiliation, humble-mmdedness on the contrary is a great and highly exalted glory.</p>
      <p> 136.  Those who truly love God do not serve Him in order to obtain the kingdom, as though they were engaged in commerce for the sake of gain, nor yet to avoid the punishment that is in store for sinners. They love Him because He is their sole God and Creator, since they know the proper hierarchy of things and that it is the duty of servants to please their lord and maker; and they submit to Him with great understanding in the face of all the afflictions that befall them. Many are the obstacles that stand in the way of pleasing God; for not merely poverty and obscurity but also riches and honor are trials for the soul. Indeed, to some extent even the solace and ease which grace bestows on the soul can easily become a temptation and a hindrance if the soul is not properly conscious of these effects of</p>
      <p> grace and does not enjoy them with great circumspection and understanding: for the spirit of evil tries to persuade the soul to relax now it possesses grace, and so contrives to implant in it sluggishness and apathy. Thus even participation in grace requires caution and discretion on the soul's part, so that the soul shows proper respect for grace and produces fruit worthy of it. There is a danger, then, that</p>
      <p> [V3] 347</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> not only affliction but also relaxation may prove a temptation for the soul, since through both it is tested by the Creator, so as to make it quite clear that it loves Him not for the sake of some gain but for Himself alone, who is truly worthy of love and honor. For the inattentive, who are deficient in faith and immature in mind, there are many obstacles to eternal life - not only distressing and painful things such as sickness, poverty and obscurity, but equally their opposites like riches, honor and praise from others, as well as the unseen warfare of the devil. For those with faith, understanding and courage, on the other hand, such things aid and abet progress towards the kingdom of God: as St Paul says, 'AH things work together for good to them that love God' (Rom. 8:28). The devout man, therefore, breaking through, overcoming and transcending those things regarded by the world as obstacles, cleaves to divine love alone. 'The cords of sinners have entangled me,' writes the psalmist, 'but I have not forgotten Thy law' (Ps. 119:61. LXX).</p>
      <p> 137. St Paul most accurately and lucidly revealed to every believing soul the perfect mystery of the Christian faith, showing to all how to attain experience of it through divine grace. This mystery is the effulgence of celestial light in the vision and power of the Spirit. He did not want anyone to think that the illumination of the Spirit consists simply in enlightening us through conceptual knowledge, and so to risk falling short of the perfect mystery of grace through ignorance and laziness. To indicate the true character of spiritual knowledge St Paul therefore gives as an example the glory of the Holy Spirit that shone from the face of Moses. 'If the ministry of death,' he says, 'engraved in letters on stone, was accompanied by such glory that the sons of Israel could not bear to gaze at the face of Moses because of the glory, transitory though it was, that shone from it, then how much greater must the glory be that accompanies the ministry of the Spirit? If the ministry of condemnation is glorious, the ministry of righteousness must greatly excel it in glory. Indeed, what once seemed full of glory now seems to have no glory at all, because it is outshone by a glory that is so much greater. If what was transitory came with glory, what endures will be far more glorious' (2 Cor. 3:7-11). He says 'transitory' because it was Moses' mortal body that shone with the glory of light. And he continues: 'Having such hope as this, we can proceed with great confidence' (2 Cor. 3:12). A little later he affirms that this everlasting and immortal glory of the Spirit</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the HomiHes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> shines even now with immortal and indestructible power in the immortal inner being of the saints: 'With unveiled face we all'-all, that is to say, who through perfect faith are bom in the Spirit -'reflect as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, and are transfigured into the same image from glory to glory through the Lord who is the Spirit' (2 Cor. 3:18). The words 'with unveiled face' indicate the soul; he adds that when one turns back to the Lord the veil is taken off, and that the Lord is the Spirit (cf 2 Cor. 3:16-17). By this he dearly shows that from the time of Adam's transgression a veil of darkness has encroached upon mankind and has covered the soul. But we believe that through the illumination of the Spirit this veil is now removed from truly faithful and saintly souls. It was for this reason that Christ came; and to those who truly believe in Him God has given the grace to attain this measure of holiness.</p>
      <p> 138.   As we said, the effulgence of the Holy Spirit is not merely some kind of revelation on the level of conceptual images, or merely an illumination of grace. It is the true and unceasing effulgence of God's own light in the soul: 'The God who said, "Out of darkness let light shine", has made His light shine in our hearts, to give us the illumination of the knowledge of Christ's glory' (2 Cor. 4:6). And the psalmist says: 'Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep unto death' (Ps. 13:3) - that is to say, lest when my flesh is dissolved my soul is darkened by the veil of the death that is the result of sin. And other passages in the psalms speak in the same way: 'Open my eyes and I will perceive the wonders of Thy law' (Ps. 119:18); and: 'Send Thy light and Thy truth, and they will guide and lead me to Thy holy mountain and into Thy tabernacles' (Ps. 43:3); and: 'We have been marked by the light of Thy countenance, 0 Lord' (Ps. 4:6. LXX), and so on.</p>
      <p> 139.   Again, the light that illumined St Paul on the road to Damaskos (cf Acts 9:3), the light through which he was raised to the third heaven where he heard unutterable mysteries (cf. 2 Cor. 12:4), was not merely the enlightenment of conceptual images or of spiritual knowledge. It was the effulgence of the power of the Holy Spirit shining in His own person in the soul. Such was its brilliance that corporeal eyes were not able to bear it and were blinded (cf. Acts 9:8); and through it all spiritual knowledge is revealed and God is truly known by the worthy and loving soul.</p>
      <p> 140.   Every soul that through its own effort and faith is privileged [V3] 349</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the Homilies</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> in this present life to put on Christ completely in the power and full assurance of grace, and to unite with the heavenly light of the incorruptible image, is initiated here and now substantively into the knowledge of all the heavenly mysteries. Moreover, in the great day of the resurrection the body also will be glorified with the same heavenly image of glory; it will be caught up by the Spirit to the heavens (cf 1 Thess. 4:17), will be given a form like the body of Christ's glory (cf. Phil. 3:21), and with Him will comhent the eternal kingdom.</p>
      <p> 141.  In so far as a man through his own effort and faith has partaken of the heavenly glory of the Holy Spirit, and has beautified his soul with good works, to the same degree will his body, too, be glorified on the day of the resurrection. What he has now stored up inwardly will then manifest itself outwardly, just as the fruit hidden during winter inside the tree comes out when it is spring. The deiform image of the Spirit imprinted even now on the inner being of the saints will make their body, too, outwardly deiform and heavenly. But impure sinners who enwrap the soul in the tenebrous veil of the spirit of this world, and who darken and disfigure the intellect with the ugliness of the passions, will outwardly manifest a body that is also tenebrous and full of every vileness.</p>
      <p> 142.  When God in His love condemned Adam to death after his transgression, he first experienced this death in his soul (cf. Gen. 3:19): his spiritual and deathless organs of perception, deprived of their celestial and spiritual enjoyment, were quenched and became as though dead. Later, after 930 years (cf. Gen. 5:5), came the death of the body. Similarly, now that God has reconciled mankind through the Cross and death of the Savior, He restores to the truly believing soul its enjoyment of spiritual light and mystery while it is still in the flesh, and once more enlightens its spiritual organs of perception with the divine light of grace. Later He will invest the body also with deathless and incorruptible glory.</p>
      <p> 143.   Those who have withdrawn from the world and lead a godly and devout life are still in many cases subject to the veil of the passions to which we all became liable through Adam's transgression: I refer to the carnal will, fittingly called death by St Paul when he said that 'the will of the flesh is death' (Rom. 8:6). Such people may be likened to men walking at night, their way lighted by the stars that are God's holy commandments; but since they have not yet completely escaped from the darkness, they cannot see everything</p>
      <p> [V3] 350</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the Homilies</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> clearly. Thus, cultivating virtue with tribulation and great faith, they should beseech Christ, the sun of righteousness, to shine in their hearts, so that they can see everything lucidly. For to those who have reached the heights of virtue, and whose hearts have been actively illumined by spiritual light, the manifold attacks of the demons are clearly evident, as are also the inexpressible vision and the hidden delight and beauty of the incorruptible world. As St Paul says: 'The perfect, whose organs of perception have been trained by practice to discriminate between good and evil.</p>
      <p> take solid food' (Heb. 5:14). And St Peter also says: 'We have the assurance of the message of the prophets; and until the day breaks and the morning star rises in your hearts you do well to give attention to it, for it is like a lamp shining in a dark place' (2 Pet. 1:19). Most people, however, are exactly like men walking at night wholly without light and not enjoying the slightest illumination in their souls from the divine Logos, so that they scarcely differ from the blind. They are totally caught up in material entanglements and the chains of temporal life, neither restrained by divine awe nor performing any virtuous acts. On the other hand, those who live in the world and are illumined by the holy commandments as by the stars, and who do cleave to God with faith and awe, are not utterly shrouded in darkness and for this reason can hope to attain salvation.</p>
      <p> 144.  Worldly riches come to men from different sources and pursuits, from high-ranking office, trade, industry, farming and so on. Something similar is the case where spiritual riches are concerned: some derive them from various gifts of grace, as St Paul makes clear when he says, 'Having then gifts different according to the grace given to us .. .' (Rom. 12:6); and some from various ascetic labors and acts of righteousness and virtue carried out for God alone, when through grace they refrain from judging, mocking or censuring their fellow-men. But some can be likened to people who dig for gold, and they are quite unmistakable: they are those who strive forward with forbearance and patience, gradually enriching the blessed hope that sustains them. Unmistakable, too, are those who are like hirelings, who are stupid and sluggish, who consume at once whatever they can lay hands on, and never patiently bring to conclusion what they have undertaken but are always threadbare and indigent. Even if they are anxious and ready to receive grace, they are lazy, indolent and fickle when it comes to putting it into practice or developing it. They have</p>
      <p> [V3]351</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> no sooner started than they have had enough, and lose all impetus for spiritual labor. For this reason whatever grace they may have received is taken away from them. The dull, slothful, lifeless and negligent disposition, always at variance with grace, barren of good works, worthless and ignoble in the sight of God, is recognizable both now and in the age to come.</p>
      <p> 145.  When man broke God's commandment and was expelled from paradise he was bound in consequence as by two chains. The first is that of temporal things and worldly pleasures-riches, glory, affection, wife, children, relations, country, possessions and, in short, all visible things from which God has summoned us to liberate ourselves through our own free choice. The second is hidden and invisible; for the soul is bound by a certain chain of darkness to the spirits of evil, and because of this darkness it cannot love God, or believe or pray as it wishes. In consequence of the transgression of the first man, we each of us find that all things visible and invisible are opposed to us. Thus, whenever someone listens obediently to the word of God, he must first begin by cutting his attachment</p>
      <p> to temporal things and renouncing all worldly pleasures. Then, if he waits attentively upon God and enters into constant communion with Him, he will receive the power to learn that there is another struggle and another battle of thoughts hidden in the depths of his heart. Persevering in this way and beseeching Christ's mercy, combining great faith in Him with endurance, he can with God's help escape from these inner bonds and fetters and from the darkness of the spirits of evil, which are the energies of the hidden passions. Through Christ's grace and power we can bring this war to a successful conclusion. But by ourselves and without divine aid it is altogether impossible for us to free ourselves from the struggle against evil thoughts: we can merely rebut them and not take pleasure in them.</p>
      <p> 146.  If a man is entangled in the things of this world, caught by their many shackles, and seduced by the evil passions, it is very hard for him to recognize that there is another invisible struggle and another inner warfare. But, after detaching himself from all visible things and worldly pleasures, and beginning to serve God, he then becomes capable of recognizing the nature of this inner struggle and unseen warfare against the passions. Yet, as we said, unless he first achieves outward detachment by aspiring to serve God totally with his whole soul, he will not recognize the secret passions of evil and his</p>
      <p> [V3] 352</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> inner fetters. On the contrary, he will be in danger of thinking that he is healthy and not ailing, when in fact he is lull of wounds and nourishes unseen passions. But if he has despised desire and glory, he may first become aware of these inner passions and then fight against them, calling on Christ with faith and receiving from heaven the weapons of the Spirit: the breastplate of righteousness, the helmet of salvation, the shield of faith, and the sword of the Spirit (cfEph. 6:14,17).</p>
      <p> 147.  The devil tries to disrupt our hope in Christ and our love for Him in a thousand ways. Inwardly he brings afflictions on the soul by means of the evil spirits, or he fills it with foul and immoral thoughts by stirring up its memory of former sins, so as to make it grow sluggish and to despair of ever attaining salvation. His aim is to cheat the soul into thinking that it generates these thoughts of its own accord and that they are not sown in it maliciously by an alien spirit. Or else he inflicts bodily suffering and brings on us vilification and tribulation through the agency of other people. But the more he shoots his fiery arrows at us, the more we must enkindle our hope in God, knowing with certainty that He deliberately permits souls that long for Him to suffer these things, so as to discover if they truly love Him.</p>
      <p> 148.  Compared with the incorruptible and eternal world, a thousand years of this world are like a grain of sand. I look at things in this way. Suppose it is within your power to be sole king of the entire world and to possess all its treasures; and suppose that your rule had begun with the first creation of mankind, and was to continue until the final transformation of the whole visible world. Would you, then, given the choice, exchange the true and unchanging</p>
      <p> kingdom, that contains nothing fleeting or perishable, for this temporal kingdom? Not, it seems to me, if your judgment is sound and you have a proper regard for yourself. 'What good will it do a man if he gains the whole world but loses his soul?' Christ asks His disciples (Matt. 16:26); and He says that there is nothing equal in value to the soul. Since the soul by itself is far more valuable than the whole world and any worldly kingdom, is not the kingdom of heaven also more valuable? That the soul is more valuable is shown by the fact that God did not see fit to bestow on any other created thing the union and fellowship with His own coessential Spirit. Not sky, sun, moon, stars, sea, earth or any other visible thing did He bless in this way, but man alone, whom of</p>
      <p> [V3]353</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> all His creatures He especially loved. If, therefore, no one with sound judgment would exchange the eternal kingdom for all the great wealth of the world and for the kingdom of the whole earth, how great is the folly of those who exchange it for accidental and casual things such as desire for something, meager glory, mediocre gain, and so on? For whenever we love something worldly and are attached to it, we are certainly choosing it instead of the kingdom of heaven. Worst of all, we regard this thing as God: as it has been said, 'A man is the slave to whatever has mastered him' (2 Pet. 2:19). We should, therefore, commit ourselves entirely to God, making ourselves dependent on Him and crucifying ourselves in soul and body as we advance in the practice of all His holy commandments.</p>
      <p> 149.  Would you think it right if this perishable glory, ephemeral kingdom and other such temporal things were gained only after great toil and sweat by those who hanker after them, while to reign endlessly with Christ and to enjoy inexpressible blessings was something to be gained cheaply and easily, and could be attained without labor and effort by anyone who wished?</p>
      <p> 150.  What is the purpose of Christ's advent? The restoration and reintegration of human nature in Him. For He restored to human nature the original dignity of Adam, and in addition bestowed on it the unutterable grace of the heavenly inheritance of the Holy Spirit. Leading it out of the prison of darkness. He showed it the way and the door to life. By traversing this way and knocking on this door we can enter the kingdom of heaven. As He said: 'Ask and it will be given to you... knock and it will be opened to you' (Matt. 7:7). By passing through this door it is possible for everyone to attain the freedom of his soul, to cut off his evil thoughts, and to become Christ's bride and consort through the communion of the Holy Spirit. Such is the ineffable love of the Lord towards man, whom he has created in His own image.</p>

      <p> (949-1022) (Toliime 4, pp. 11-75)</p>
      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> Among the Greek Fathers there are few if any who are better known to us than St Symeon the New Theologian (949-1022). We are fortunate to have not only the biography composed by his disciple Nikitas Stithatos but also frequent personal references, of the utmost vividness, in the writings of St Symeon himself/ His life-story illustrates the central significance of spiritual fatherhood within the Orthodox mystical tradition. Bom in Asia Minor, from parents belonging to the lesser provincial nobility, St Symeon was sent as a child of eleven to an uncle in Constantinople, probably with the expectation that he would eventually follow a career in the imperial service. But when he was fourteen there occurred an encounter that proved decisive for his future life - his meeting with a monk at Constantinople, also named Symeon and usually styled 'the Pious' or 'the Devout' (6  ILvika^f[(^)  who belonged to the celebrated monastery of Studios. St Symeon the Studite (c. 917-986/7), who soon became spiritual father to the young Symeon, was a lay monk, never ordained priest; for in the Christian East the ministry of spiritual direction has often been exercised by monks not in holy orders, and also, although less frequently, by nuns and even by non-monastics. St Symeon the New Theologian himself wrote a treatise specifically defending the right of monks who are not priests to 'bind' and 'loose', that is, to receive confessions and to confer absolution."</p>
      <p> ' The fullest treatment of St Symeon's life and teaching is by Archbishop Basil (Krivocheine),  In the Light of Christ: Saint Svmeon the New Theologian  (Crestwood, 1986). For further bibliography, see H.J.M. Turner,  St Symeon the New Theologian and Spiritual Fatherhood  (Leiden, 1990), pp. ix-xii; and the article by T. Spidlik in  Dictionnaire de  Spiritualiti  xiv (1990), cols 1387-1401. The  Life  by Nikitas Stithatos has been edited (with a French translation) by 1. Hausherr and G. Horn,  Vie de Svmeon le Nouveau Theologien (949-1022) par Nicetas Stethatos (Orientalia Christiana  xii [45): Rome, 1928). In our introductory note we follow the generally accepted dating of St Symeon's life; but it is possible that in fact he was bom in 957 and died in 1035, in which case the dating of the other events in his life must also be adjusted.</p>

      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian</p>
      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> Under the Studite's guidance, the young Symeon's life of prayer developed rapidly. When he was aged about twenty - and still fully involved in a secular career - he received a vision of the divine and uncreated light, the first in a series of such visions that marked his later years. After an unhappy relapse to a worldly manner of life, in 977 he entered the monastery of Studios as a novice. But a group of monks in the community, resenting his close relationship with his spiritual father Symeon the Studite, forced him to leave within less than a year. His spiritual father placed him in the nearby Constantinopolitan monastery of St Mamas, and here in quick succession he was professed as a monk, and then (c. 98o) ordained to the priesthood and elected abbot, an office that he held for the next twenty-five years. The monastery, at that time in a state of decline, underwent a striking revival under his leadership. St Symeon became well known in the capital as a spiritual father, with many prominent lay people coming to him for counsel and confession.</p>
      <p> There is every reason to believe that St Symeon was a loving and compassionate shepherd to his monks. But he was also, in his own words, an 'enthusiastic zealot' who set high standards. He expected, for example, that each monk would receive communion frequently and, following the teaching of St Symeon the Studite, he urged that no one should ever do so without shedding tears. His demanding expectations led in 996-8 to a revolt among the monks, but St Symeon eventually succeeded in reconciling the dissidents. More seriously, a few years later he was</p>
      <p> denounced to the church authorities by persons outside the monastery, among other reasons because, after the death of his spiritual father Symeon the Studite, he had at once begun to honour him publicly as a saint. Doubtless the New Theologian's teaching on lay confession also brought him under suspicion. These continuing attacks led him to resign his position as abbot in 1005. Four years later, in 1009, he was tried before the patriarch and the holy synod and condemned to exile at Paloukiton, on the Asiatic coast of the Bosphorus. Although the sentence was soon revoked and he was even offered a bishopric, he chose to continue living at his place of exile, in the company of a few disciples. Here he died on 12 March 1022.</p>
      <p> The high respect felt for St Symeon by his followers is evident in the title that they ascribed to him, 'the New Theologian'. The term 'theologian' is to be understood in this context, not in its modem</p>
      <p> [V4] 13</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian Introductory Note</p>
      <p> academic sense, but to signify a person of prayer, who speaks about the vision of God on the basis of his own immediate experience. Before St Symeon's time, the title 'theologian' had been reserved in the Orthodox Church chietly for two writers: for St John the Evangelist, author of the most 'mystical' of the four Gospels, and for St Gregory of Nazianzos, writer of contemplative poetry, honoured in the Christian East as one of the Three Great Hierarchs. If St Symeon is called 'the New Theologian', this means that he is to be ranked with the other two as a faithful witness to the continuing tradition of inner prayer. As well as being in this experiential sense a 'theologian', St Symeon may also be regarded as a 'missionary' of the mystical life. Convinced that contemplative union with God is possible for all alike, he believed that it was his duty to share with others his experiences of divine grace. When he spoke in this way about his visions, it was not from pride but from a radical humility. 'If God has shown such mercy to me a sinner,' he was saying in effect, 'then certainly He can and will do as much and more for you. The best is for all - if only you will accept it.'</p>
      <p> From the voluminous writings of St Syrneon, the editors St Makarios and St Nikodimos have selected two for inclusion in the Philokalia.  The first work.  On Faith,  is one of the catecheses or homilies which St Symeon delivered to his monks while abbot of St Mamas. Here he speaks in the third person about the inner life of a young man named George. It is generally agreed that this is none other than Symeon himself; possibly George was the baptismal name that he used before entering the monastic life. The narrative makes abundantly plain how crucial was the role played in his development by his spiritual father Symeon the Studite, the 'holy monk as he is termed in the text. It is significant that, in the work by Mark the Ascetic that the young Symeon was given to read, he was struck particularly by the injunction, 'Tisten to your conscience', and by the reference to 'the energies of the Holy Spirit': an insistence on the need for direct personal experience is one of the  leitmotifs  in the New Theologian's teaching. When describing his initial vision of divine light, accompanied by tears of joy, he emphasizes that this happened to him</p>

We have based our translation on the critical text of the original Greek in the edition of the  Catecheses  by Archbishop Basil (Krivocheine),  Sources chretiennes  104 (Paris, 1964), pp. 364-93.

      <p> while still a layman, heavily burdened by worldly distractions: this shows that the heights of contemplation are accessible to anyone with genuine faith in God, whatever their outward circumstances.</p>
      <p> The second piece.  One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts,  is a composite work. The opening section, §§ 1-118, comes from a longer series of 226 texts by St Symeon the New Theologian.^ The section that follows, §§ 119-52, is by the New Theologian's teacher, St Symeon the Studite, while the first part of § 153 is from the  Life  of St Symeon the New Theologian by Nikitas Stithatos, § 31.</p>
      <p> The section by the New Theologian alludes to many of his favourite themes: to the vision of divine light (§§68,</p>
      <p> 105-6) and the gift of tears (§§ 67, 69); to the need for conscious experience of the Holy Spirit (§ 85); to the ministry of the spiritual father (§§ 16-19, 38-9, 41) - but note that the disciple's obedience is not wholly unqualified (§ 33). St Symeon's rigour as an 'enthusiastic zealot' is evident in his demand for a definitive break on the monk's part with all past links, especially with his family (§§ 3-8). At the same time the New Theologian is generous in his recognition of the variety of individual vocations: we cannot speak in the abstract of any one form of life as higher than another - of the hermit life, for example, as superior to the cenobitic - for the best and highest form of life is, for each one, the particular way to which he or she is personally called (§§ 88-92). The fullness of contemplation is accessible to married people living in cities as well as to the desert- dweller.</p>
      <p> In the texts that follow, from the pen of St Symeon the Studite, the situation envisaged is that of a large, highly organized community such as the Studios monastery itself. The author insists upon strict poverty, the cutting-off of self-will, simplicity in personal relationships, the avoidance of all unnecessary complications. He speaks about compunction  (katanyxis)  as an experience that is not so much penitential as joyful (§ 140), about the vision of divine light (§ 150), and about the importance of obedience to the spiritual father (§§ 129, 141) - themes which his disciple the New Theologian was later to develop.</p>

      <p> Brethren and fathers, it is good that we make God's mercy known to all and speak to those close to us of the compassion and inexpressible bounty He has shown us. For as you know 1 neither fasted, nor kept vigils, nor slept on bare ground, but - to borrow the Psalmist's words - '1 humbled myself and, in short, 'the Lord saved me'.</p>
      <p> Or, to put it even more briefly, 1 did no more than believe and the Lord accepted me (cf. Ps. 116:6, 10; 27:10. LXX). Many things stand in the way of our acquiring humility, but there is nothing that prevents us from having</p>
      <p> faith. For if we want it with all our heart, it will immediately become active in us, since it is God's gift to us and a pre-eminent characteristic of our nature, even though it is also subject to our individual power of free will. That is why even Scythians and other outlandish peoples have faith in each other's words. Yet to demonstrate through actual facts the effect of our deeply rooted faith and to confirm what I have just said, I will tell you a story related to me by someone who was entirely trustworthy.</p>
      <p> A man by the name of George, young in age - he was about twenty - was living in Constantinople during our own times. He was good-looking, and so studied in dress, manners and gait, that some of those who take note only of outer appearances and harshly judge the behavior of others began to harbor malicious suspicions about him. This young man, then, made the acquaintance of a holy monk who lived in one of the monasteries in the city; and to him he opened his soul and from him he received a short rule which he had to keep in mind. He also asked him for a book giving an account of the ways of monks and their ascetic practices; so the elder gave him the work of Mark the Monk,  On the Spiritual Law.  This the young man accepted as though it had been sent by God Himself, and in the expectation that he would reap richly from it he read it from end to end with eagerness</p>
      <p> [V4] 17</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian On Faith</p>
      <p> and attention. And though he benefited from the whole work, there were three passages only which he fixed in his heart.</p>
      <p> The first of these three passages read as follows: 'If you desire spiritual health, listen to your conscience, do all it tells you, and you will benefit.' The second passage read: 'He who seeks the energies of the Holy Spirit before he has actively observed the commandments is like someone who sells himself into slavery and who, as soon as he is bought, asks to be given his freedom while still keeping his purchase-money.' And the third passage said the following: 'Blind is the man crying out and saying: "Son of David, have mercy upon me" (Luke 18:38). He prays with his body alone, and not yet with spiritual knowledge. But when the man once blind received his sight and saw the Lord, he acknowledged Him no longer as the Son of David but as the Son of God, and worshipped Him' (cf. John 9:38).</p>
      <p> On reading these three passages the young man was struck with awe and fully believed that if he examined his conscience he would benefit, that if he practiced the commandments he would experience the energy of the Holy Spirit, and that through the grace of the Holy Spirit he would recover his spiritual vision and would see the Lord. Wounded thus with love and desire for the Lord, he expectantly sought His primal beauty, however hidden it might be. And, he assured me, he did nothing else except carry out every evening, before he went to bed, the short rule given to him by the holy elder. When his conscience told him, 'Make more prostrations, recite additional psalms, and repeat "Lord, have mercy" more often, for you can do so', he readily and unhesitatingly obeyed, and did everything as though asked to do it by God Himself. And from that time on he never went to bed with his conscience reproaching him and saying, 'Why have you not done this?" Thus, as he followed it scrupulously, and as daily it increased its demands, in a few days he had greatly added to his evening office.</p>
      <p> During the day he was in charge of a patrician's household and each day he went to the palace, engaging in the</p>
      <p> tasks demanded by such a life, so that no one was aware of his other pursuits. Every evening tears flowed from his eyes, he multiplied the prostrations he made with his face to the ground, his feet together and rooted to the spot on which</p>
      <p> [V4] 18</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian On Faith</p>
      <p> he stood. He prayed assiduously to the Mother of God with sighs and tears, and as though the Lord was physically present he fell at His most pure feet, while like the blind man he besought mercy and asked that the eyes of his soul should be opened. As his prayers lasted longer every evening, he continued in this way until midnight, never growing slack or indolent during this period, his whole body under control, not moving his eyes or looking up. He stood still as a statue or a bodiless spirit.</p>
      <p> One day, as he stood repeating more in his intellect than with his mouth the words, 'God, have mercy upon me, a sinner' (Luke 18:13), suddenly a profuse flood of divine light appeared above him and filled the whole room. As this happened the young man lost his bearings, forgetting whether he was in a house or under a roof; for he saw nothing but light around him and did not even know that he stood upon the earth. He had no fear of falling, or awareness of the world, nor did any of those things that beset men and bodily beings enter his mind. Instead he was wholly united to non-material light, so much so that it seemed to him that he himself had been transformed into light. Oblivious of all else, he was filled with tears and with inexpressible joy and gladness. Then his intellect ascended to heaven and beheld another light, more lucid than the first. Miraculously there appeared to him, standing close to that light, the holy, angelic elder of whom we have spoken and who had given him the short rule and the book.</p>
      <p> When I heard this story, I thought how greatly the intercession of this saint had helped the young man, and how God had chosen to show him to what heights of virtue the holy man had attained.</p>
      <p> When this vision was over and the young man, as he told me, had come back to himself, he was struck with joy and amazement. He wept with all his heart, and sweetness mingled with his tears. Finally he fell on his bed, and at that moment the cock crowed, announcing the middle of the night. Shortly after the church bells rang for matins and he got up as usual to chant the office, not having had a thought of sleep during the whole night.</p>
      <p> As God knows - for He brings things about according to decisions of which He alone is aware - all this happened without the young man having done anything more than you have heard. But what he did he did with true faith and unhesitating expectation. And let it not be said that he did these things by way of an experiment, for he had never spoken or thought of acting in such a spirit. Indeed, to make</p>
      <p> [V4] 19</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian On Faith</p>
      <p> experiments and to try things out is evidence of a lack of faith. On the contrary, after rejecting every passion-charged and self-indulgent thought this young man, as he himself assured me, paid such attention to what his</p>
      <p> conscience said that he regarded aU material things of hfe with indifference, and did not even find pleasure in food and drink, or want to partake of them frequently.</p>
      <p> You have heard, my brethren, what great things faith in God can bring about when it is confirmed by actions. You will have realized that youth is not to be despised and that without understanding and fear of God old age is useless. You have learnt that the heart of a city cannot prevent us from practicing God's commandments so long as we are diligent and watchful, nor can stillness or withdrawal from the world be of any benefit if we are lazy and negligent. We have certainly all heard of David, and we admire him and say that he is unique and there cannot be another like him. Yet here, lo and behold, is something more than David. For David was specially chosen by God: he was anointed to be prophet and king; he was inspired by the Holy Spirit; and he was granted many revelations concerning God. Thus when he sinned and was deprived of the grace of the Spirit and of his gift of prophecy, and was estranged from his usual communion with God, is there anything astonishing in the fact that he should recall the state of grace from which he had fallen and should ask to enjoy those privileges once more (cf Ps. 51:11-12)? But our young man had never even conceived of any of these things. He was devoted only to what is transient and worldly, and he could imagine nothing superior to such things. Yet - how unpredictable are Thy ways. Lord - he had only to hear of these divine realities and he believed in them immediately; indeed, he believed so surely that he implemented his faith in corresponding action. It was thanks to this action that his mind took wing and rose to heaven, drawing to it the compassion of Christ's Mother. Through her intercession God was appeased and bestowed on him the grace of the Spirit. This gave him the strength to rise to heaven and to behold the light that everyone longs for but very few attain.</p>
      <p> This young man had not observed long fasts or slept on the ground, worn a hair shirt or shaved his head, nor had he shunned the world physically, though he had in spirit, by keeping a few vigils; yet he appeared to be superior to Lot, so renowned in Sodom (cf. Gen. 19). Or, rather, although in a body, he was an angel, constrained yet unconstrained, visible but transcending physicality, human in appearance</p>
      <p> [V4] 20</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian On Faith</p>
      <p> but immaterial when perceived spiritually, outwardly all things to all men (cf. 1 Cor. 9:22) but inwardly solely present to God alone, the knower of all things. Thus when the visible sun set, he found that its place was taken by the tender light of spiritual luminosity, which is the pledge and foretaste of the unceasing light that is to succeed it. And this was as it should be; for the love of that for which he was searching took him out of the world, beyond nature and all material things, filling him wholly with the Spirit and transforming him into light. And all this happened to him while he was living in the middle of the city, and was steward of a house, having in his charge slaves and free men and carrying out all the tasks incumbent on such a life.</p>
      <p> Enough has been said in praise of this young man and to stimulate you to a similar longing, in imitation of him. Or would you still like me to speak of other things, greater than these - things which perhaps you might not be able to take in? Yet what can be greater or more perfect than the fear of God? Indeed, nothing is greater than this. It is as St Gregory of Nazianzos has written: "Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (Prov. 1:7). For where there is fear, there the commandments are kept, and where the commandments are kept the flesh is purified, together with</p>
      <p> the cloud that envelops the soul and prevents it from clearly seeing the divine radiance. Where there is this purification there is illumination, and illumination is the fulfillment of the longing of those who desire the greatest of all supernal things or even that which is above all greatness." With these words he showed that illumination by the Spirit is the endless end of every virtue, and that whoever attains it has finished with everything sensory and has begun to experience the knowledge of spiritual realities.</p>
      <p> Such, my brethren, are the wonders of God. And God reveals His hidden saints so that some may emulate them and others have no excuse for not doing so. Provided they live a worthy life, both those who choose to dwell in the midst of noise and hubbub and those who dwell in monasteries, mountains and caves can achieve salvation. Solely because of their faith in Him God bestows great blessings on them. Hence those who because of their laziness have failed to attain salvation will have no excuse to offer on the day of judgment. For He who promised to grant us salvation simply on account of our faith in Him is not a liar. So show mercy to yourselves and to us who love you</p>
      <p> [V4] 21</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian On Faith</p>
      <p> and often grieve and shed tears far you - for this is what the merciful and compassionate God has asked us to do. Trust in the Lord with all your soul. Leave the world and everything that passes away, and draw close to God and cleave to Him; for in a little while 'heaven and earth will pass away' (Matt. 24:35), and apart from Him there will be no firm ground on which to stand, no limit, nothing to check the fall of sinners. God is infinite and cannot be grasped. Tell me, then, if you can, what place there will be for those who fall away from His kingdom?</p>
      <p> I grieve, I exhaust my heart, I pine for you when I bring to mind that we have a Lord so bountiful and compassionate that simply if we have faith in Him He grants us gifts beyond our imagination - gifts we have never heard or thought of and that 'man's heart has not grasped' (1 Cor. 2:9). Yet we, like beasts, prefer the earth and the things of the earth that through His great mercy it yields in order to supply our bodily needs; and if we use these things modestly, then our soul may ascend unhampered towards divine realities, nourished spiritually by the Holy Spirit according to the degree of our purification and to the level to which we have ascended.</p>
      <p> This is our purpose, for this we were created and brought forth: that after having received lesser blessings in this world we may through our gratitude to God and our love for Him enjoy great and eternal blessings in the life to come. But, alas, far from having any concern for the blessings in store, we are even ungrateful for those at hand, and we are like the demons, or - if trath be told - even worse. Thus we deserve greater punishment than they, for we have been given greater blessings. For we know that God became for our sakes like us in everything except sin, so that He might deliver us from delusion and free us from sin. But what is the use of saying this? The truth is that we believe in all these things only as words, while we deny them where our acts are concerned. Is not Christ's name uttered everywhere, in towns and villages, in monasteries and on mountains? Search diligently, if you will, and find out whether anyone keeps His commandments. Among thousands and myriads you will scarcely find one who is a Christian both in word and in act. Did not our Lord and God say in the Gospel, 'He that believes in Me will also do what I do - indeed, he will do greater things' (John 14:12)? But which of us dares to say, 'I do Christ's work and I truly believe in Christ?' Do you not see, brethren, that on the day of judgment we risk being classed among the</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian On Faith</p>
      <p> unbelievers and will be chastised more severely even than those ignorant of Christ? Inevitably either we must be chastised as unbelievers or Christ is a liar - and that, my brethren, is impossible.</p>
      <p> I have written this not to dissuade you from withdrawing from the world or to encourage you to live in the midst of it. Rather I have written it so that all who happen to read it may be assured that whoever wants to act rightly will receive from God the power so to do, wherever he may be. In fact, the tale I have told actually encourages withdrawal. For if the young man in question, who lived in the world and never had a thought of renouncing it, or of shedding his possessions, or of submitting to the rule of obedience, received such mercy from God simply because he trusted in Him and called on Him with his whole soul, how much greater blessings should those hope to attain who have abandoned all worldly things and all worldly relationships and who as God commanded have for His sake surrendered their very souls to death (cf Luke 14:26)? Moreover, if, unhesitating in your faith and wholehearted in your determination, you do begin to act rightly and to experience the blessing that comes from so doing, you will of your own accord realize that worldly cares and living in the world are a great obstacle to those who wish to live in conformity with God. What we have related about this young man is amazing and unexpected, and we have never heard of anything like it happening to anyone else. Even though it may have happened to others or may happen in the future, they should realize that they will lose the blessing they have received unless they do promptly abandon the world. This is exactly what I learnt from that young man.</p>
      <p> I subsequently met him after he had become a monk, in the third or fourth year of his monastic life. He was then thirty-two. I knew him very well: we had been friends from childhood and had been brought up together. On account of this he also told me the following: 'A few days after that incredible change in my life and the more than human help I received, I was continually attacked by the temptations of my worldly life - temptations that thwarted my secret activities and that little by little deprived me of the blessings I had been given. As a result I longed to get completely away from the world and in solitude to seek out Him who had appeared to me. For, brother, I was convinced that He had appeared to me solely in order to draw me, unworthy as I was, to Himself and to separate me entirely from the world. Yet lacking the strength to respond straight away I gradually forgot everything I have</p>
      <p> [V4] 23</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian On Faith</p>
      <p> told you about and fell into utter darkness, to such an extent that 1 no longer remembered or even thought of anything, major or minor, connected with those experiences. Rather, I plunged into evil ways more deeply than ever before and ended up in such a state that it was as if I had never understood or heard Christ's holy words. Even the saint who had once shown me such mercy and who had given me that short rule and had sent me that book became for me merely someone I had happened to meet, and I gave no thought to the things I had seen because of him. I am telling you this,' he continued, 'so you can see quite clearly the pit of perdition into which I fell, contemptible as I was, because of my sloth and negligence, and so you will be filled with amazement at the inexpressible blessings</p>
      <p> that God subsequently bestowed on me.</p>
      <p> 'For - though I do not know how to explain it - unknown to myself love and trust toward that saintly elder had remained in my unhappy heart; and it was I think for this reason that, as a result of his prayers, after many years God in His compassion had mercy on me. Through him God again dragged me out of my chronic state of delusion and rescued me from the pit of evil. In spite of my unworthmess I had not completely broken with the elder, but when I was in the city I often visited him in his cell and confessed to him what had happened to me, although, without conscience as I was, I did not carry out any of his instructions. But now, as you see, the merciful God has forgiven my many sins, and through that same saintly elder has granted me the grace to become a monk and - in spite of my being truly unworthy of it - has permitted me to be constantly with him. After .great labors and many tears, combined with strict solitude, total obedience, the complete elimination of my own will and many other rigorous practices and actions, I have been going forward resolutely and unremittingly along my path, and have again been granted a vision, faint as it is, of a small ray of that most gentle divine light, although up to now I have not been privileged to see it as I saw it on that original occasion.'</p>
      <p> This and many other things he told me with tears. And I, hapless that I am, as I listened to his holy words realized that he was entirely filled with divine grace and was truly wise, despite his lack of worldly wisdom. Moreover, since he had acquired his unerring knowledge of spiritual realities through actual experience, I asked him to tell me how faith could bring about such miracles and to instruct me by setting it</p>
      <p> [V4] 24</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian On Faith</p>
      <p> down in writing. He began to speak to me about these matters and was quite ready to write down his observations. Not to lengthen this present text, I have set forth what he said elsewhere for the delight of those who seek with Faith to learn from such writings.</p>
      <p> Thus I beg you, brethren in Christ, let us also diligently follow the path of Christ's commandments, so that our faces are not covered in shame (cf Ps. 34:5). To everyone who knocks resolutely He opens the gates of His kingdom, and on him who asks He at once bestows the Holy Spirit (cf. Luke 11:13). Nor is it possible for the person who seeks with all his soul not to find (cf. Matt. 7:7-8) and not to be enriched with the richness of His gifts. Thus you, too, will be nourished by the inexpressible blessings that He has prepared for those who love Him (cf. 1 Cor. 2:9). Here, in this present life, you will enjoy them in part, in accordance with His supernal wisdom; while in the life to come you will enjoy them fully, in company with the saints of all time, in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be glory throughout the ages. Amen.</p>
      <p> [V4] 25</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> 1. To have faith is to die for Christ and for His commandments; to believe that this death brings life; to regard poverty as wealth, and lowliness and humiliation as true glory and honor; to believe that by not possessing anything one possesses everything (cf. 2 Cor. 6:9-10) or, rather, that not possessing anything is to possess the 'unsearchable</p>
      <p> riches' of the knowledge of Christ (Eph. 3:8); and to look upon all visible things as dross and smoke.</p>
      <p> 2.  To have faith in Christ means not only to stand aloof from the delights of this life, but also to endure patiently every temptation and test that brings upon us distress, affliction and misfortune, for as long as God wishes and until He comes to us. 'I waited patiently for the Lord and He heard me' (Ps. 40:1).</p>
      <p> 3.   Those who in any way esteem their parents above the commandments of God do not possess faith in Christ (cf Matt. 10:37). Their own conscience will certainly accuse them - if their conscience is still alive to their lack of faith. People who possess faith never transgress at any point the commandment of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p> 4.  Faith in God engenders desire, for spiritual blessings and fear of punishment. Desire for spiritual blessings and fear of punishment induce a strict keeping of the commandments. The strict keeping of the commandments teaches us our own weakness. Awareness of our true weakness generates mindfulness of death. The person who is mindful of death will insistently strive to discover what awaits him after his exit from this present life. But he who seeks to know what is to come should first of all detach himself from the things of this world; for whoever is constrained by an attachment, however small, to these</p>
      <p> [V4] 26</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> things cannot acquire full knowledge of his post-mortal state. Even should God in His mercy give him some taste of this knowledge, it will be taken away from him unless he speedily severs his worldly attachments and dedicates himself wholly to it, not willingly giving thought to anything extraneous to it.</p>
      <p> 5.  The renunciation of and total separation from this world - which includes self-alienation from all material things, from the modes, attitudes and forms of this present life, as well as the denial of one's own body and will -swiftly brings great rewards whenever it is zealously accomplished.</p>
      <p> 6.   If you are intent on renouncing the world, do not permit yourself the solace of dwelling in it for the time being, even if all your relatives and friends try to compel you to do so. It is the demons who provoke them in this way in order to extinguish the ardor of your heart; for even if they cannot thwart your purpose completely, they will try to slacken and enfeeble it.</p>
      <p> 7.  When you are courageously impervious to all the pleasures of this life, then the demons will promote in your relatives a spurious compassion for you, making them weep and lament over you before your eyes. You will realize that it is spurious when you stick firmly to your purpose, for you will then see them becoming suddenly infuriated with you: they will no longer want to set eyes on you and will reject you as if you were an enemy.</p>
      <p> 8.  When you see the pain which your parents, relatives and friends experience because of you, mock the demon who in his subtlety has provoked these feelings against you. Withdraw with fear and determination, and entreat God insistently to bring you swiftly into His haven, where He will give rest to your tired and over-burdened soul. The sea of life nourishes many forms of danger and even of utter destruction.</p>
      <p> 9.  He who would hate the world must love God from the depths of his soul and always have Him in mind; nothing else leads us to abandon the world more joyfully and to turn away from it as though it were so much trash.</p>
      <p> 10.   Once called, do not seek to remain in the world for any reason at all, good or bad; obey the call straight away. God rejoices at nothing so much as our promptitude; and swift obedience involving a life of frugality is better than procrastination amidst great wealth.</p>
      <p> 11.   If the world and everything in it passes away, while God alone is [V4] 27</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> eternal and immortal, then rejoice, since for His sake you have renounced what is corruptible. Not merely wealth and possessions, but every sensual pleasure and sinful enjoyment are corruptive. Only the commandments of God are light and life, and everyone acknowledges them as such.</p>
      <p> 12.  If, brother, consumed by spiritual ardor you have entered a monastery or placed yourself under a spiritual father, do not indulge in baths, food or other bodily consolations, even if urged to do so by your spiritual father himself or by your monastic brethren. On the contrary, always be ready to fast, to endure hardship, to exercise the utmost self-control. If, however, your spiritual father insists that you should enjoy some comfort, you will obey him, not even in such a case acting according to your own will. But if he does not insist, then gladly endure what you have freely chosen to do, and your soul will benefit. By keeping to this rule, you will find that always, in every situation, you are abstinent and self-controlled, prompt to renounce your own will in all things. Moreover, you will keep alight in your heart that flame which constrains you to stand aloof from everything.</p>
      <p> 13.  When the demons have done all they can to shake our resolve to live a spiritual life and to hinder us from carrying it out, and have failed in their efforts, they enter pious hypocrites and through them try to obstruct us. First, as if moved by love and compassion, they exhort us to give our bodies some relaxation, on the grounds that otherwise we will become physically exhausted and listless. Then they invite us to join in useless discussions, making us waste whole days in them. If we pay attention to these hypocrites and model ourselves on them, the demons change tactics, mocking us for falling in this way; but if we take no notice of their suggestions, and hold ourselves aloof from all, recollected and reserved, they are consumed with jealousy and do everything they can until they have driven us from the monastery. Arrogance cannot bear to see itself scorned and humility held in honor.</p>
      <p> 14.  A man full of self-esteem suffers torture when he sees a humble person weeping and being doubly compensated: by God, who is moved to pity because of his tears, and by men, who are moved to give him praise that he never sought.</p>
      <p> 15.  Once you have entrusted yourself wholly to your spiritual father, you will find yourself alienated from all things human, worldly or material, that might lead you astray. Without his consent you will</p>
      <p> [V4] 28</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> not have any desire to concern yourself with such things; nor wiU you ask him to allow you anything, great or small, unless he himself on his own initiative either tells you to take it or gives it to you with his own hands.</p>
      <p> 16.  Without the permission of your spiritual father, do not give alms from the money you brought with you, and do not even allow an agent acting on your behalf to distribute any of your wealth. It is better for others to regard you as poor and destitute than to distribute your wealth to those in need while you are still a novice. A person of pure faith will entrust everything to the decision of his spiritual father as if putting it into the hands of God.</p>
      <p> 17.  Even if you are burning with thirst, do not ask for a drink of water until on his own initiative your spiritual father urges you to drink. Constrain yourself, force yourself in all things, prevail over yourself, saying to yourself: 'If God wills.  ..."  And if you deserve a drink, God will certainly reveal this to your spiritual father and he will say to you, 'Drink.' Thus you will drink with a pure conscience, even if it is not the correct moment to do so.</p>
      <p> 18.   Someone with experience of spiritual grace and possessing an unadulterated faith once said, invoking God as witness of its truth: 'I resolved never to ask for anythmg to eat or drink from my spiritual father, or to take anything at all without his consent, but to wait until God prompted him to give me an order. Acting in this way, I never deviated from my aim.'</p>
      <p> 19.  Whoever possesses unclouded faith in his spiritual father will, on seeing him, think that he is seeing Christ Himself; when with him or following him, he will firmly believe that he is with and following Christ. Such a person will never want to associate with anyone else, nor will he value anything in the world more than his thought of him and his love for him. For what is finer or more profitable in this world or in the next than to be with Christ? What is more gracious or beautiful than the sight of Him? If someone is privileged to enjoy His companionship, he draws from this eternal life.</p>
      <p> 20.  If you truly love and pray for those who slander and maltreat you, who hate and defraud you, you will make rapid progress, for when your heart is fully aware that this is happening, your thoughts and, indeed, your whole soul with all its three powers are drawn down into the depths of humility and washed with tears. This in its turn raises your intellect to the heaven of dispassion, conferring on it the</p>
      <p> [V4] 29</p>
      <p> St Symeon the New Theologian One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts</p>
      <p> gift of contemplation. Because you have tasted such blessing, you come to regard all the things in this life as mere dross, so that you do not even take food or drink with pleasure or any frequency.</p>
      <p> 21.  The spiritual contestant must not only abstain from evil actions, but must also strive to be free from hostile thoughts and notions. He should always concentrate on ideas of a soul-nourishing and spiritual nature, thus remaining detached from worldly cares.</p>
      <p> 22.  A person who strips his whole body bare, but keeps his eyes covered with a cloth, cannot see the light despite his nakedness. Similarly a person detached from all things, including possessions, and even delivered from the passions themselves, will never see the spiritual light - our Lord and God, Jesus Christ - until he frees his soul's eye from worldly concerns and evil thoughts.</p>
      <p> 23.   Worldly thoughts and material concerns blind the mind, or eye of the soul, like a cloth that covers the physical eyes: so long as we are not free of them, we cannot see. But once they are removed by mindfulness of death, then we clearly see the true light, that which illumines everyone who attains the spiritual world.</p>
      <p> 24.  The person blind from birth will not recognize or believe the significance of what I have just written; but the person privileged with sight will bear witness that what I have said is true.</p>
      <p> 25.  The person who sees with physical eyes knows when it is night and when it is day; the blind man is unaware of both. The person who has come to see with the eyes of the spirit, and who has beheld the true and quenchless light, is consciously aware when he is deprived of it should he return, out of laziness, to his former blindness; and he will not be ignorant of why this has happened. But the person blind from birth, and remaining so, knows nothing of these things from personal experience of their operation. He knows about them only from hearsay, but has never actually seen them; and if he tells others what he has heard, neither he nor his audience will know what he is talking about.</p>
      <p> 26.  We cannot both sate ourselves with food and spiritually enjoy divine and noumenal blessings; the more we pander to the stomach the less can we experience such enjoyment. But to the degree that we discipline the body we are filled with spiritual nourishment and grace.</p>
      <p> 27.   We should abandon all that is earthly. We should not only renounce riches and gold and other material things, but should also expel desire for such things completely from our soul We should hate</p>
