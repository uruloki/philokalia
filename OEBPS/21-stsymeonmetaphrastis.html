      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homilies</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> (lOth century) (Volume 3, pp. 282-353)</p>
      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> The Makarian Homilies were attributed in the past to St Makarios the Great of Egypt (c. 300-c. 390). A Coptic monk, priest and spiritual father in the desert of Sketis, he figures prominently in the  Lausiac History  of Palladios^ and in the  Sayings of the Desert Fathers,^  and is commemorated in the Church's calendar on 19 January. But this ascription is open to doubt for many reasons: in particular, the early sources say nothing whatever about any writings by Makarios of Egypt, while the background presupposed by the Homilies is not Egyptian but Syrian. All that can be said with any confidence is that the Homilies are the work of an unknown author, writing probably in Syria or Mesopotamia during the late fourth or the early fifth century.</p>
      <p> There are similarities in language and symbolism, and sometimes also in thought, between the Homilies and Messalianism, an ascetic movement that originated in Syria in the late fourth century and spread rapidly to other parts of the Christian East. Some scholars have even concluded that the Homilies are in reality the Ascetic Book' of the Messalians, and on somewhat slender evidence they attribute them to Symeon of Mesopotamia, one of the leading Messalians. Other specialists, without denying the points of resemblance, argue that they should not be exaggerated. The heretical teachings characteristic of extreme Messalianism are not in fact to be found in the Homilies; when language and symbols associated with the Messalians are employed, they are used in a fundamentally Orthodox way.</p>

      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> Indeed, the Homilies may continue to be regarded, today as in the past, as an authentic expression of Eastern Christian spirituahty at its best.^</p>
      <p> St Nikodimos and St Makarios included in the  Philokalia,  not the original text of the Homilies - which, while lively, is also repetitive and diffuse - but an eleventh-century adaptation attributed to St Symeon Metaphrastis ('the Translator': not to be confused with St Symeon the New Theologian). Symeon Metaphrastis followed an administrative career in the civil service, rising to the high rank of logothete or chancellor, which he held under the Emperors Nikiphoros II Phokas (963-9), John I Tzimiskis (969-76) and Basil II (976-1025). It is thought that he became a monk at the end of his life, and he is commemorated on 9 November. Probably he is to be identified with the chronicler Symeon Magistros. A voluminous writer, he is chiefly remembered for his edition  of \he Menologion or  Lives of the Saints.  He is also probably the author of the prayers for use before and after communion, often ascribed to his namesake Symeon the New Theologian. The Greek title in the  Philokalia  states that Symeon has paraphrased the main group of Fifty Homilies (known as collection II),' but in reality most of the material comes from another group of Twenty-Six Homilies (collection IV).^</p>
      <p> In his selection'' St Symeon Metaphrastis has embodied the master- themes that dominate the Makarian Homilies: the constant conflict or 'unseen warfare' (§ 146) in the depths of the human heart between grace and Satan, between the Holy Spirit and the spirit of evil; the 'co-operation' or  synergeia  (§41) between divine grace and human free will; the need for direct personal experience, for a 'full and conscious assurance' (§ 106) of the indwelling presence of the</p>

      <p> Holy Spirit - a theme taken up and developed by St Symeon the New Theologian. Much is said about the resurrection glory of the human body at the last day (§§61-3, 140-1), but it is also insisted that the saints experience here and now a genuine foretaste of the glory of the age to come: the final resurrection is simply the outward and bodily manifestation of what is already hidden during this present life in the souls of the righteous. The passages on the vision of divine light (§§137-9) anticipate the teaching of St Gregory Palamas and the fourteenth-century Hesychasts.</p>
      <p> While the Makarian Homilies do not underestimate the need for 'labour and sweat of the brow' (§51), what chiefly distinguishes them is their sense of communion with the Holy Spirit, and of the love and joy that He imparts. With their message of encouragement, their vigorous style and simple illustrations, it is not surprising that they should often be given as reading to novices at their first entry to the monastery.</p>

      <p> 1.  We receive salvation by grace and as a divine gift of the Spirit. But to attain the full measure of virtue we need also to possess faith and love, and to struggle to exercise our free will with integrity. In this manner we inherit eternal life as a consequence of both grace and justice. We do not reach the final stage of spiritual maturity through divine power and grace alone, without ourselves making any effort; but neither on the other hand do we attain the final measure of freedom and purity as a result of our own diligence and strength alone, apart from any divine assistance. If the Lord does not build the house, it is said, and protect the city, in vain does the watchman keep awake, and in vain do the laborer and the builder work (cf. Ps. 127:1 -4).</p>
      <p> 2.   What is the will of God that St Paul urges and invites each of us to attain (cf. 1 Thess. 4:3)? It is total cleansing from sin, freedom from the shameful passions and the acquisition of the highest virtue. In other words, it is the purification and sanctification of the heart that comes about through fully experienced and conscious participation in the perfect and divine Spirit. 'Blessed are the pure in heart," it is said, 'for they shall see God' (Matt. 5:8); and again: 'Become perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matt. 5:48). And the psalmist says: 'Let my heart be unerring in Thy statutes, so that I am not ashamed" (Ps. 119:80); and again: 'When I pay attention to all Thy commandments, then I will not be ashamed" (Ps. 119:6). And to the person that asked, "Who will ascend the Lord's hill, or who will stand in His holy place?" The psalmist replied: "He that has clean hands and a pure heart" (Ps. 24:3-4), that is to say, he who has completely destroyed sin in act and thought.</p>
      <p> 3.  The Holy Spirit, knowing that the unseen and secret passions are hard to get rid of - for they are as it were rooted in the soul - shows us through the psalmist how we can purify ourselves from</p>

      <p> them. 'Cleanse me from my secret faults', writes the psalmist (Ps. 19:12), as though to say that through much prayer and faith, and by turning completely to God, we are able, with the help of the Spirit, to conquer them. But this is on condition that we too strive against them and keep strict watch over our heart (cf Prov. 4:23).</p>
      <p> 4.  Moses indicates figuratively that the soul should not be divided in will between good and evil, but should pursue the good alone; and that it must cultivate not the dual fruits of virtue and vice but those of virtue only. For he says: 'Do not yoke together on your threshing floor animals of a different species, such as ox and ass; but yoke together animals of the same species and so thresh your com' (cf. Deut. 22:10). This is to say, do not let virtue and vice work together on the threshing floor of your heart, but let virtue alone work there. Again he says: 'Do not weave flax into a woolen garment, or wool into a linen garment" (cf. Deut. 22:11); and: "Do not cultivate two kinds of fruit together on the same patch of your land' (cf. Deut. 22:9). Similarly, you are not to mate an animal of one species with an animal of another species, but to mate like with like. All this is a concealed way of saying that you must not cultivate virtue and vice together in yourself, but you must devote yourself singlemindedly to producing the fruits of virtue; and you must not share your soul with two spirits - the Spirit of God and the spirit of the world -but you must give it solely to the Spirit of God and must reap only the fruits of the Spirit. It is for this reason that the psalmist writes: 'I have prospered in all Thy commandments; I hate every false way' (Ps. 119:128).</p>
      <p> 5.   The virgin soul that desires to be united to God must keep itself pure not only from overt sins like unchastity, murder, theft, gluttony, backbiting, falsity, avarice, greed and so on; but to an even greater degree it must keep itself pure from sins that are hidden, such as desire, self-esteem, love of popularity, hypocrisy, love of power, wiliness, malice, hatred, unbelief, envy, self-love, affectation and other things of this kind. According to Scripture, these concealed sins of the soul are just as pernicious as the overt sins. "The Lord has scattered the bones of those who seek to please men', it says (Ps. 53:5. LXX); and: The Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man' (Ps. 5:6), thus making it clear that deceitfulness is just as abhorrent to God as murder. Again, it numbers among the "workers of iniquity' those who 'speak peace to their neighbor but have evil in their hearts' (Ps. 28: 3),</p>

      <p> and elsewhere it speaks of those who commit lawless acts in their hearts (cf. Ps. 58:2). It also says: 'Woe to you, when men speak well of you' (Luke 6:26) - that is to say, when you want to hear people say good things about you and when you hang upon their glory and praise. It is true that those who do good cannot escape notice altogether. Indeed, the Lord Himself says: 'Let your light shine before men' (Matt. 5:16), though here it is understood that we do good for the glory of God and not for our own glory or because we desire men's praise. If this is not the case, then we are lacking in faith, as the Lord makes clear when He says: 'How can you have faith when you receive honor from one another, and do not seek the honor that comes from the only God?' (John 5:44). St Paul bids us to do everything, even to eat and to drink, for the glory of God; "for." he says, 'whether you eat or drink, or do anything else, do it for the glory of God" (1 Cor. 10:31). And St John equates hatred with murder when he says: 'Whoever hates his brother is a murderer' (1 John 3:15).</p>
      <p> 6.  'Love bears with all things, patiently accepts all things; love never fails' (1 Cor. 13:7-8). This phrase 'never fails' makes it clear that, unless they have been granted total deliverance from the passions through the most complete and active love of the Spirit, even those who have received spiritual gifts are still liable to falter: they are still in danger, and must struggle in fear against the attacks launched on them by the spirits of evil. St Paul shows that not to be in danger of falling or liable to passion is such a lofty state that the tongues of angels, prophecy, all knowledge and gifts of healing are as nothing compared to it (cf. 1 Cor. 13:1-8).</p>
      <p> 7.  St Paul has here indicated the goal of perfection so that everyone, realizing his poverty in the face of such richness, may long for it intensely and may strive forward along the spiritual path until he attains it. As has been said: 'Run, that you may reach your goal" (1 Cor. 9:24).</p>
      <p> 8.  To deny oneself (cf. Matt. 16:24) is to be ready to give up everything for the brethren's sake and not to follow one's own will in anything, or to possess anything except one's own clothes. He who attains this state, and is thus freed from all things, joyfully does only what he is asked to do. He regards all the brethren, and especially the superiors and those appointed to bear the burdens of the monastery, as lords and masters for Christ's sake. In this way he obeys Christ who</p>

      <p> said: 'He among you who wants to be first and pre-eminent, let him be the last of all and the servant and slave of air(cf Mark 9:35), not inviting any glory, honor or praise from the brethren for his service and conduct. He serves the brethren with complete goodwill, with love and simplicity, not with outward show and with an eye to gaining popularity, but regarding himself as a debtor in everything.</p>
      <p> 9. The superiors of the community, who shoulder a great burden, must fight the crafty designs of evil with the weapon of humility, lest because of the authority they exercise over their subordinate brethren they grow proud and so act to their own detriment rather than to their profit. They should be like compassionate fathers, in the name of God giving themselves bodily and spiritually to the service of the community, keeping watch over the brethren and</p>
      <p> constantly looking after them as children of God. Outwardly they should not disown the rank of superior, as for instance in giving orders or advice to the more experienced monks, or in punishing or rebuking someone when necessary, and in encouraging where it is appropriate; otherwise, on the grounds that they are being humble or gentle, they will introduce confusion into the monastery through not preserving the due order of superiors and subordinates. But inwardly, in their own minds, they should regard themselves as unworthy servants of all their brethren, and as teachers entrusted with the Lord's children; and with unreserved goodwill and fear of God they should do all they can to make each of the brethren apt for every good work, knowing that the reward they will receive from God for such labor will be great and inalienable.</p>
      <p> 10.  There are times when servants whose task it is to instruct the young do not hesitate in all charity to beat them for the sake of discipline or good behavior, even if those they punish are the children of their own masters. Similarly, superiors should punish those of the brethren in need of discipline, yet not in anger or haughtiness, or for personal revenge, but with compassion and with a view to their reform and spiritual profit.</p>
      <p> 11.   He who wants to be stamped with the virtues should pursue before everything else and at all times fear of God and holy love, the first and greatest of the commandments (cf. Matt. 22:38). Let him continually beseech the Lord to send this love into his heart, and thus let him advance and grow, augmenting it by grace day by day through the ceaseless and unbroken remembrance of God. Through diligence</p>
      <p> [V3] 289</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>

      <p> Spiritual Perfection</p>
      <p> and effort, concern and struggle he becomes capable of acquiring love for God, given form within him by the grace and bounty of Christ. Through such love the second commandment, love for one's neighbor (cf Matt. 22:39), can easily be attained. Let these two primary commandments take precedence over the others and let him pursue them more than the others. In this way the secondary commandments will follow naturally on the primary. But should he neglect this first and great commandment, the love for God that is formed with divine help from our inner disposition, our clear conscience and our life-giving remembrance of God, then in consequence of this neglect he cannot soundly and purely accomplish the second commandment, that requires simply the outward diligence of service. For the guile of evil, finding the intellect void of the remembrance of God, and of love and longing for Him, will make the divine commandments appear harsh and laborious, kindling in his soul grumbling, resentment and complaints about having to serve the brethren; or else it will deceive him with the presumption of self-righteousness, filling him with arrogance and making him think that he is of great importance and worthy of esteem, and that he</p>
      <p> has entirely fulfilled the commandments.</p>
      <p> 12.  When a man thinks that he is keeping the commandments perfectly, it is obvious that he is mistaken and that he is breaking one of them, since he judges himself and does not submit to the true judge. But when, in St Paul's words (cf. Rom. 8:16), the Spirit of God testifies along with our spirit, then indeed we are worthy of Christ and are children of God. This is not the case", however, when we justify ourselves merely on the basis of what we ourselves think. It is not the man who commends himself that is to be trusted, but he whom Christ commends (cf. 2 Cor. 10:18). When a man lacks the remembrance and fear of God, it is inevitable that he will long for glory and will seek for praise from those whom he serves. As has already been explained, such a person is called an unbeliever by Christ; for He says: 'How can you have faith when you receive honor from one another, and do not seek the honor that comes from the only God?" (John 5:44).</p>
      <p> 13.  As has been said, love for God can be attained through the intellect's great struggles and labors in holy meditation and in unremitting attention to all that is good. The devil, on the contrary, impedes our intellect, not letting it devote itself to divine love</p>
      <p> [V3] 290</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>

      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> I</p>
      <p> Spiritual Perfection</p>
      <p> through the remembrance of what is good, but enticing the senses with earthly desires. For the intellect that dwells undistractedly in the love and remembrance of God is the devil's death and, so to say, his noose. Hence it is only through the first commandment, love for God, that genuine love for one's brother can be established, and that true simplicity, gentleness, humility, integrity, goodness, prayer and the whole beautiful crown of the virtues can be perfected. Much struggle is needed, therefore, and much inward and unseen travail, much scrutiny of our thoughts and training of our soul's enfeebled organs of perception, before we can discriminate between good and evil, and strengthen and give fresh life to the afflicted powers of our soul through the diligent striving of our intellect towards God. For by always cleaving to God in this way our intellect will become one spirit with the Lord, as St Paul puts it (cf 1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
      <p> 14. Those aspiring to the state of virtue must strive to fulfill the commandments by sustaining this inward struggle, travail and meditation unceasingly night and day, whether praying or serving, eating or drinking, or doing anything else. In this way, if any good comes about it will be to God's glory and not to their own. The fulfillment of the commandments presents no difficulty or trouble to us when it is facilitated by the love of God and when this love relieves it of all that is burdensome. As has been said, the whole effort of the enemy is directed towards distracting</p>
      <p> the intellect from the remembrance, fear and love of God, and to turning it by means of earthly forms and seductions away from what is truly good towards what appears to be good.</p>
      <p> 15. The patriarch Abraham, when he was receiving Melchisedec, the priest of God, made him an offering from the firstfruits of the earth and so obtained his blessing (cf. Gen. 14:19-20). Through this incident the Spirit indicates that the first and highest elements of our constitution - the intellect, the conscience, the loving power of the soul -must initially be offered to God as a holy sacrifice. The firstfruits and the highest of our true thoughts must be continually devoted to remembrance of Him, engrossed in His love and in unutterable and boundless longing for Him. In this way we can grow and move forward day by day, assisted by divine grace. Then the burden of fulfilling the commandments will appear light to us, and we will carry them out faultlessly and irreproachably, helped by the Lord Himself on account of our faith in Him.</p>

      <p> 16.   Where outward ascetic practice is concerned, which virtue is the most important? The answer to this is that the virtues are linked one to the other, and follow as it were a sacred sequence, one depending on the other. For instance, prayer is linked to love, love to joy, joy to gentleness, gentleness to humility, humility to service, service to hope, hope to faith, faith to obedience, and obedience to simplicity. Similarly, the vices are linked one to another: hatred to anger, anger to pride, pride to self-esteem, self-esteem to unbelief, unbelief to hardheartedness, hardheartedness to negligence, negligence to sluggishness, sluggishness to apathy, apathy to listlessness, hstlessness to lack of endurance, lack of endurance to self-indulgence, and so on with all the other vices.</p>
      <p> 17.  The devil tries to soil and defile every good thing a man would do by intermingling with it his own seeds in the form of self-esteem, presumption, complaint, and other things of this kind, so that what we do is not done for God alone, or with a glad heart. Abel offered a sacrifice to God of the fat and firstlings of his flock, while Cain offered gifts of the fruits of the earth, but not of the firstfruits: and that is why God looked with favor on Abel's sacrifices, but paid no attention to Cain's gifts (cf Gen. 4:3-5). This shows us that it is possible to do something good in the wrong way - that is to say, to do it negligently, or scornfully, or else not for God's sake but for some other purpose; and for this reason it is unacceptable to God.</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> II Prayer</p>
      <p> 18.  The crown of every good endeavor and the highest of achievements is dihgence in prayer. Through it God guiding us and lending a helping hand, we come to acquire the other virtues. It is in prayer that the saints experience communion in the hidden energy of God's holiness and inner union with it, and their intellect itself is brought through unutterable love into the presence of the Lord. "Thou hast given gladness to my heart", wrote the psalmist (Ps. 4:7); and the Lord Himself said that 'the kingdom of heaven is within you' (cf Luke 17:21). And what does the kingdom being within mean except that the heavenly gladness of the Spirit is clearly stamped on the virtuous soul? For already in this life, through active communion in the Spirit, the virtuous soul receives a foretaste and a prelude of the delight, joy and spiritual gladness which the saints will enjoy in the eternal light of Christ's kingdom. This is something that St Paul also affirms: "He consoles us in our afflictions, so that we can console others in every affliction through the consolation with which we ourselves have been consoled by God" (2 Cor. 1:4). And passages in the Psalms likewise hint at this active gladness and consolation of the Spirit, such as: 'My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God' (Ps. 84:2. LXX): and: 'My soul will be filled with marrow and fatness" (Ps. 63:5).</p>
      <p> 19.   Just as the work of prayer is greater than other work, so it demands greater effort and attention from the person ardently devoted to it, lest without him being aware the devil deprives him of it. The greater the good a person has in his care, the greater the attacks the devil launches on him; hence he must keep strict watch, so that fruits of love and humility, simplicity and goodness - and, along with them, fruits of discrimination - may grow daily from the constancy of his prayer. These will make evident his progress and increase in holiness, thus encouraging others to make similar efforts.</p>

      <p> Paraphrase of the Homilies</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> II Prayer</p>
      <p> 20.  Not only does St Paul instruct us to pray without ceasing and to persist in prayer (cf. 1 Thess. 5:17; Rom. 12:12), but so also does the Lord when He says that God will vindicate those who cry out to Him day and night (cf Luke 18:7) and counsels us to 'watch and pray" (Matt. 26 : 41). We must therefore pray always and not lose heart</p>
      <p> (cf. Luke 18:1). To put things more succinctly: he who persists in prayer has to struggle greatly and exert himself relentlessly if he is to overcome the many obstacles with which the devil tries to impede his diligence - obstacles such as sleep, listlessness, physical torpor, distraction of thought, confusion of intellect, debility, and so on, not to mention afflictions, and also the attacks of the evil spirits that violently fight against us, opposing us and trying to prevent the soul from approaching God when it truly and ceaselessly seeks Him.</p>
      <p> 21.  He who cultivates prayer has to fight with all diligence and watchfulness, all endurance, all struggle of soul and toil of body, so that he does not become sluggish and surrender himself to distraction of thought, to excessive sleep, to listlessness, debility and confusion, or defile himself with turbulent and indecent suggestions, yielding his mind to things of this kind, satisfied merely with standing or kneeling for a long time, while his intellect wanders far away. For unless a person has been trained in strict vigilance, so that when attacked by a flood of useless thoughts he tests and sifts them all, yearning always for the Lord, he is readily seduced in many unseen ways by the devil. Moreover, those not yet capable of persisting in prayer can easily grow arrogant, thus allowing the machinations of evil to destroy the good work in which they are engaged and making a present of it to the devil.</p>
      <p> 22.   Unless humility and love, simplicity and goodness regulate our prayer, this prayer - or, rather, this pretence of prayer - cannot profit us at all. And this applies not only to prayer, but to every labor and hardship undertaken for the sake of virtue, whether this be virginity, fasting, vigil, psalmody, service or any other work. If we do not see in ourselves the fruits of love, peace, joy, simplicity, humility, gentleness, guilelessness, faith, forbearance and kindliness, then we endure our hardship to no purpose. We accept the hardships in order to reap the fruits. If the fruits of love are not in us, our labor is useless. In such a case we differ in nothing from the five foolish virgins: because their hearts were not filled here and now, in this present life, with spiritual oil - that is to say, with the energy of the</p>

      <p> Spirit active in the virtues of which we have spoken - they were called fools and were abjectly excluded from the royal bridechamber, not enjoying any reward for their efforts to preserve their virginity (cf Matt. 25:1-13). When we cultivate a vineyard, the whole of our attention and labor is given in the expectation of the vintage; if there is no vintage, all our work is to no purpose. Similarly, if through the activity of the Spirit we do not perceive within ourselves the fruits of love, peace, joy and the other qualities mentioned by St Paul (cf. Gal. 5:22), and cannot affirm this with all assurance and spiritual awareness, then our labor for the sake of virginity, prayer, psalmody, fasting and vigil is useless. For, as we said, our labors and hardships of soul and body should be undertaken in expectation of the spiritual harvest; and where the virtues are concerned, the harvest consists of spiritual enjoyment and incorruptible pleasure secretly made active by the Spirit in faithful and humble hearts. Thus the labors and hardships</p>
      <p> must be regarded as labors and hardships and the fruits as fruits. Should someone through lack of spiritual knowledge think that his work and hardship are fruits of the Spirit, he should realize that he is deluding himself, and in this way depriving himself of the truly great fruits of the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 23.   The person who has surrendered himself entirely to sin indulges with enjoyment and pleasure in unnatural and shameful passions - licentiousness, unchastity, greed, hatred, guile and other forms of vice - as though they were natural. The genuine and perfected Christian, on the other hand, with great enjoyment and spiritual pleasure participates effortlessly and without impediment in all the virtues and all the supranatural fruits of the Spirit - love, peace, patient endurance, faith, humility and the entire truly golden galaxy of virtue - as though they were natural. He does not fight any longer against the passions of evil, for he has been totally set free of them by the Lord; while from the blessed Spirit he has received Christ's perfect peace and joy in his heart. Of such a man it may be said that he cleaves to the Lord and has become one spirit with Him (cf. 1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
      <p> 24.  Those who because of their spiritual immaturity cannot yet commit themselves entirely to the work of prayer should undertake to serve the brethren with reverence, faith and devout fear. They should do this because they regard such service as a divine commandment and a spiritual task; they should not expect reward.</p>
      <p> [V3]295</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>

      <p> II Prayer</p>
      <p> honor or thanks from men, and they should shun all complaint, haughtiness, negligence or sluggishness. In this way they will not soil and corrupt this blessed work, but through their reverence, fear and joy will make it acceptable to God.</p>
      <p> 25.   The Lord descended to the human level with such love, goodness and divine compassion for us, that He took it upon Himself not to overlook the reward of any good work, but to lead us step by step from the small to the great virtues, so that not even a cup of cold water should go unrequited. For He said: "If anyone gives even a cup of cold water to someone simply in the name of a disciple, I tell you truly that he will not go unrewarded" (cf Matt. 10:42); and elsewhere: "Whatever you did to one of these, you did to Me" (cf. Matt. 25:40). Only the action must be done in the name of God, not for the sake of receiving honor from men: the Lord said, "simply in the name of a disciple", that is to say, in the fear and love of Christ. Those who do good with ostentation are rebuked categorically by the Lord: 'I tell you truly, they have received their reward" (Matt. 6:2).</p>
      <p> 26.   Simplicity before others, guilelessness, mutual love, joy and humility of every kind, must be laid down as the foundation of the community. Otherwise, disparaging others or grumbling about them, we make our labor profitless. He who persists ceaselessly in prayer must not disparage the man incapable of doing this, nor must the man who devotes himself to serving the needs of the community complain about those who are dedicated to prayer. For if both the prayers and the service are offered in a spirit of simplicity and love for others, the superabundance of those dedicated to prayer will make up for the insufficiency of those who serve, and  vice versa.  In this way the equality</p>
      <p> that St Paul commends is maintained (of. 2 Cor. 8:14): he who has much does not have to excess and he who has little has no lack (cf. Exod. 16:18).</p>
      <p> 27.  God's will is done on earth as in heaven when, in the way indicated, we do not disparage one another, and when not only are we without jealousy but we are united one to another in simplicity and in mutual love, peace and joy, and regard our brother's progress as our own and his failure as our loss.</p>
      <p> 28.  He who is sluggish in prayer, and slothful and negligent in serving his brethren and in performing other holy tasks, is explicitly called an idler by the apostle, and condemned as unworthy even of his bread. For St Paul writes that the idler is not to have any food (cf. 2 Thess. 3:10);</p>
      <p> [V3] 296</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> II Prayer</p>
      <p> and elsewhere it is said that God hates idlers, that the idle man cannot be trusted, and that idleness has taught great evil (cf. Ecclus. 33:27). Thus each of us should bear the fruit of some action performed in God's name, even if he has employed himself diligently in but one good work. Otherwise he will be totally barren, and without any share in eternal blessings.</p>
      <p> 29.  When people say that it is impossible to attain perfection, to be once and for all free from the passions, or to participate fully in the Holy Spirit, we should cite Holy Scripture against them, showing them that they are ignorant and speak falsely and dangerously. For the Lord said: 'Become perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect' (Matt. 5:48), perfection denoting total purity; and: 'I desire these men to be with Me wherever I am, so that they may see My glory' (John 17:24). He also said: "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away' (Matt. 24:35). And St Paul is saying the same as Christ when he writes: '. . . so that we may present every man perfect in Christ" (Col. 1:28); and:". . . until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ' (Eph. 4:13). Thus by aspiring to perfection two of the best things come about, provided we struggle diligently and unceasingly: we seek to attain this perfect measure and growth; and we are not conquered by vanity, but look upon ourselves as petty and mean because we have not yet reached our goal.</p>
      <p> 30.   Those who deny the possibility of perfection inflict the greatest damage on the soul in three ways. First, they manifestly disbelieve the inspired Scriptures. Then, because they do not make the greatest and fullest goal of Christianity their own, and so do not aspire to attain it, they can have no longing and diligence, no hunger and thirst for righteousness (cf Matt. 5:6); on the contrary, content with outward show and behavior and with minor accomplishments of this kind, they abandon that blessed expectation together with the pursuit of perfection and of the total purification of the passions. Third, thinking they have reached the goal when they have acquired a few</p>
      <p> virtues, and not pressing on to the true goal, not only are they incapable of having any humility, poverty and contrition of heart but, justifying themselves on the grounds that they have already arrived, they make no efforts to progress and grow day by day.</p>
      <p> 31. People who think it is impossible to attain through the Spirit [V3] 297</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the HomiHes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> II Prayer</p>
      <p> the 'new creation" of the pure heart (cf 2 Cor. 5:17) are rightly and explicitly likened by the apostle to those who, because of their unbelief, were found unworthy of entering the promised land and whose bodies on that account 'were left lying in the desert' (Heb. 3:17). What is here outwardly described as the promised land signifies inwardly that deliverance from the passions which the apostle regards as the goal of every commandment. This is the true promised land, and for its sake these figurative teachings have been handed down. In order to protect his disciples from yielding to unbelief the apostle says to them: 'Make sure, my brethren, that no one among you has an evil heart of unbelief, turning away from the living God" (Heb. 3:12). By 'turning away" he means not the denial of God but disbelief in His promises. Interpreting the events of Jewish history allegorically and indicating their true meaning, he says: "For some, when they heard, were rebellious, though not all of those who were brought out of Egypt by Moses. And with whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who had sinned, whose bodies were left lying in the desert? And to whom did He vow that they would not enter into His rest unless it was to those who refused to believe? We see, then, that it was because of their unbelief that they could not enter" (Heb. 3:16-19). And he continues: "Let us be fearful, then: although the promise of entering into His rest still holds good, some of you may be excluded from it. For we have heard the divine message, as they did; but the message that they heard did not profit them, since it was not accompanied by faith on their part. We, however, who have faith do enter into God's rest" (Heb. 4:1-3). Shortly after this he draws the same conclusion: 'Let us strive therefore to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall through copying this example of unbelief (Heb. 4:11). For Christians what true rest is there other than deliverance from the sinful passions and the fullest active indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the purified heart? And the apostle again impels his readers towards this by referring to faith: 'Let us then draw near with a true heart and in the full assurance of faith, our hearts cleansed of an evil conscience" (Heb. 10:22). And again: "How much more will the blood of Jesus purge our conscience of dead works, so that we may serve the living and true God" (cf. Heb. 9:14). Because of the measureless blessings promised by God to men in these words, we should dedicate ourselves as grateful servants and regard what is promised as true and</p>

      <p> certain. In this way, even if through sluggishness or debility of resolution we do not give ourselves once for all to our Maker, or if we do not strive to achieve the greatest and most perfect measure of virtue, none the less through an upright and undistorted will and a sound faith we may attain some degree of mercy.</p>
      <p> 32. Prayer rightly combined with understanding is superior to every virtue and commandment. The Lord Himself testifies to this. For in the house of Martha and Mary He contrasted Martha, who was engaged in looking after Him, with Mary, who sat at His feet joyfully drinking the ambrosia of His divine words. When Martha complained and appealed to Christ, He made clear to her what takes precedence, saying: 'Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things; one thing alone is needful: Mary has chosen what is best, and it cannot be taken away from her' (Luke 10:41-42). He said this not in order to disparage acts of service, but so as to distinguish clearly what is higher from what is lower. For how could He not give His sanction to service when He Himself performed such service in washing His disciples' feet, and was so far from discountenancing it that He bade His disciples to behave in the same way towards each other (cf John 13:4-16)? Moreover, the apostles themselves, when they were oppressed by serving at table, also singled out prayer and understanding as the higher form of work. 'It is not right', they said, 'for us to abandon the word of God in order to serve at table. Let us appoint chosen men, full of the Holy Spirit, for this service; we will devote ourselves to the ministry of the Logos and to prayer' (cf. Acts 6:2-4). In this way they put first things before secondary things, although they recognized that both spring from the same blessed root.</p>

      <p> 33. The signs that accompany those who wish to submit to the Logos of God and who bring forth good fruit are: sighing, weeping, sorrow, stillness, shaking of the head, prayer, silence, persistence, bitter grief, tribulation of heart arising from religious devotion. In addition, their actions manifest vigilance, fasting, self-control, gentleness, forbearance, unceasing prayer, study of the divine Scriptures, faith, humilit)', brotherly affection, submission, rigorous toil, hardship, love, kindliness, courtesy and-the sum of all-light, which is the Lord. The signs that accompany those who are not producing the fruit of life are listlessness, day-dreaming, curiosity, lack of attention.</p>
      <p> grumbling, instability; and in their actions they manifest gluttony, anger, wrath, back-biting, conceit, untimely talk, unbelief, disorderliness, forgetful-ness, unrest, sordid greed, avarice, envy, factiousness, contempt, garrulity, senseless laughter, willfulness and - the sum of all - darkness, which is Satan.</p>
      <p> 34.  In accordance with divine providence, the devil was not sent at once to the Gehenna assigned to him, but his sentence was postponed in order to let him test and try men's free will. In this way, he unintentionally fosters greater maturity and righteousness in the saints by promoting their patient endurance, and so is the cause of their greater glory; and, at the same time, through his malevolence and his scheming against the saints he justifies more fully his own punishment. In this way, too, sin becomes more utterly sinful, as St Paul puts it (cf. Rom. 7:13).</p>
      <p> 35.   By deceiving Adam and in this way gaining mastery over him, the devil deprived him of his authority and proclaimed himself lord of this world. For in the beginning God appointed man to be the lord of this world and the master of visible things (cf. Gen. 1:26). On this account, fire had no power over him, water did not drown him, no animal injured him, poisonous snakes had no effect on him. But once he</p>
      <p> [V3] 300</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> III Patient Endurance and Discrimination</p>
      <p> had been deceived, he surrendered his lordship to his deceiver. For this reason sorcerers and magicians, through the use of diabolic energy, become with God's permission miracle-workers: they have power over poisonous snakes and they challenge fire and water, as was exemplified by the followers of Jannes and Jambres who opposed Moses (cf. Exod. chs. 7-8; 2 Tim. 3:8), and by the Simon who resisted the chief apostle, Peter (cf. Acts 8:18-24).</p>
      <p> 36.  When the devil beheld Adam's original glory shining from the face of Moses (cf. Exod. 34 : 30-31), he was cut to the quick since he saw in this a sign of the coming destruction of his kingdom. St Paul's words, 'Death held sway from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned" (Rom. 5:14), may be taken to refer to this. In my opinion the glorified face of Moses preserved the type and example of the first man created by the hands of God. It is for this reason that when death - that is to say, the devil, who is the cause of death - saw it, he then guessed that his kingdom would fall, as in fact happened with the advent of the Lord. Genuine Christians are therefore encompassed by this glory even in this present life; and inwardly they have annulled death, that is to say, the shameful passions, which cannot operate within them, since the glory of the Holy Spirit shines fully and consciously in their souls. In the resurrection, moreover, death is totally abolished.</p>
      <p> 37.  When, using the woman as his accomplice, the devil deceived Adam, he divested him of the glory that enveloped him. Thus Adam found himself naked and perceived his disfigurement, of which he had been unaware</p>
      <p> until that moment since he had dehghted his mind with celestial beauty. After his transgression, on the other hand, his thoughts became base and material, and the simplicity and goodness of his mind were intertwined with evil worldly concerns. The closing of paradise, and the placing of the cherubim with the burning sword to prevent his entrance (cf. Gen. 3:24), must be regarded as actual events; but they are also realities encountered inwardly by each soul. A veil of darkness-the fire of the worldly spirit-surrounds the heart, preventing the intellect from communing with God, and the soul from praying, believing and loving the Lord as it desires to do. All these things may be learnt from experience by those who truly entrust themselves to the Lord, persist in prayer, and fight zealously against the enemy.</p>
      <p> 38.   The lord of this world is a rod of chastisement and a scourge to [V3] 301</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>

      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> III Patient Endurance and Discrimination</p>
      <p> beginners in the spiritual life. Yet, as has been said, he brings them great glory and added honor because of the afflictions and trials they endure. In this way he helps them to attain the state of perfection, while he prepares even greater and harsher punishment for himself. In short, something most beneficial is brought about through him: as has been said, evil, while intending what is not good, contributes to the good. For, in souls whose intention is sound, even that which appears harmful results in something good. As St Paul says: "All things work together for good to them that love God' (Rom. 8:28).</p>
      <p> 39.  It is on this account that the rod of chastisement was permitted, so that through it, as in a furnace, the vessels might be more rigorously fired; but those unequal to the test, being easily broken, are rejected as faulty, since they cannot endure the heat of the fire. Being a servant and the Lord's creation, the devil tests and afflicts people, not as he thinks fit or desires, but to the extent that his Master allows him. Knowing the exact nature of everything, God permits each person to be tested according to his strength. As St Paul puts it: 'God is to be trusted not to let you be tried beyond your strength, but with the trial He will provide a way out, so that you are able to bear it' (1 Cor. 10:13).</p>
      <p> 40.  As the Lord affirms, the person who seeks and knocks and who never gives up asking will attain what he asks for (cf Matt. 7:8). Only he must have the courage to entreat continually with intellect and tongue, and to cleave to God relentlessly with bodily worship; and he must not entangle himself in worldly things or indulge in evil passions. He who said, 'Whatever you ask for in prayer, believing, you will receive" (Matt. 21:22), is not a liar. Those who say that even if you fulfill all the commandments in the hope of attaining grace in this present life, you will gain nothing, are ignorant and what they say is wrong and contrary to divine Scripture. There is no injustice in God that would make Him fail to fulfill His obligations if we fulfill ours. Only you must see to it that when the time comes</p>
      <p> for your soul to leave your hapless body you are still engaged in spiritual struggle, pressing on, awaiting the promise, persevering, trusting, seeking with discrimination. Do not disbelieve me when I say that you will go forth joyfully, with confidence, and you will be found worthy to see the kingdom of God. Indeed, if your soul is refined through your faith and ardor, you are already in communion with God. The person who looks lustfully at a woman has already committed adultery with her in his heart (cf. Matt. 5:28), and even if he has not sullied his body is regarded as already</p>
      <p> [V3] 302</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> III Patient Endurance and Discrimination</p>
      <p> guilty of adultery. Similarly, the person who expels evil from his heart and who cleaves to God with longing, supplication, diligence and love, already enjoys communion with God, and has even now received from God this great gift, that he can persist in prayer diligently and devotedly. If the giving of a cup of cold water does not go unrewarded (cf. Matt. 10:42), how much more will God give what He has promised to those who devote themselves to Him night and day?</p>
      <p> 41.  Those who are troubled by what will happen to them if one day they find themselves full of hatred for their brother, or realize that involuntarily they are in the grip of some other evil passion, should be told that they need to struggle without intermission against the devil and evil thoughts. For where the darkness of the passions and death -that is to say, the will of the flesh - hold sway, it is impossible for some evil fruit not to manifest itself, visibly or invisibly. A bodily wound, even if it only discharges slightly, exudes moisture and festers or is puffy and swells up, until it is totally healed. This is so even when it is being treated and when no remedy is wittingly omitted. But if the festering is neglected it can lead to the corruption of the whole body. In a similar way the soul's passions, even if they receive great attention, will go on smoldering within the soul until with steadfast diligence they are finally cured through the grace and co-operation of Christ. For there is a certain hidden pollution and a strange darkness of the passions that, in spite of man's pure nature, have insinuated themselves into the whole of humanity as a result of Adam's transgression; and they obscure and defile both body and soul. But just as iron when fired and struck is purified, or gold mixed with copper or iron is separated out by fire, so through the most pure Passion of the Savior the soul, fired and struck by the Holy Spirit, is cleansed of every passion and of every sin.</p>
      <p> 42.   Just as many lamps may be lit from the same oil and from a single light, and yet often do not give out an equal radiance, so the gifts that come from different virtues reflect the light of the Holy Spirit in different ways. Or as the many inhabitants of a single city all use bread and water, though some of them are men, some infants, some children, some old people, and there is a great variety and difference among them; or as wheat sown in the same field may bear dissimilar ears of com, though they are all brought to the same threshing-floor and stored in the same</p>
      <p> bam: so it seems to me that in the resurrection of the dead different degrees of glory will be distinguished and recognized among those who are resurrected, depending on the level of virtue they</p>

      <p> III Patient Endurance and Discrimination</p>
      <p> have attained and the extent of their participation during this present life in the Holy Spirit that already dwells within them. This is the significance of the phrase, 'Star differs from star in glory" (1 Cor. 15:41).</p>
      <p> 43.   Even if some stars are smaller than others, they all shine with a single light. The image is quite clear; but let us give attention to one thing only: after being bom in the Holy Spirit, to wash away our indwelling sin. Once this birth through the Holy Spirit has taken place, it means that an image of perfection is active within us in an initial form, though it is not yet expressed in terms of power, intellect or courage. Whoever has attained the full measure of mature manhood naturally lays aside childish things (cf 1 Cor. 13:11). That is why St Paul says that speaking in tongues and prophecies will come to an end (cf 1 Cor. 13:8). Just as an adult does not eat foods or use words fitting for a child, but scorns them as unworthy of him, since he has entered another stage of life, so the person who approaches perfection in the evangelic virtues ceases to be an infant with respect to that perfection. To quote St Paul again, 'When I grew up I finished with childish things'(l Cor. 13:11).</p>
      <p> 44.   The person who is bom in the Spirit is in a certain manner perfect, just as we call an infant perfect when all his limbs are sound. But the Lord has not bestowed the grace of the Spirit so that one may fall into sin. Men are themselves the cause of the evils into which they fall: not living in accordance with grace they are taken captive by evil. Man can lapse through his own natural thoughts if he is negligent or inattentive or presumptuous. St Paul himself says: To stop me from growing unduly elated I was given a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan' (2 Cor. 12:7). You see how even those who have attained such great heights as St Paul stand in need of protection. Yet if man did not give the devil the opportunity he would not be forcibly dominated by him. Because of this, his actions are not to be imputed either to Christ or to the devil. But if finally he submits to the grace of the Spirit, he is on the side of Christ. If this is not the case, even though he is bom in the Spirit - that is to say, even though he participates in the Holy Spirit-yet because of his actions he follows the will of Satan. For if it were the Lord or Satan who had forcibly seized hold of him, then he himself would not be the cause of his falling into hell or of his attaining God's kingdom.</p>
      <p> 45.  He who follows the spiritual path must pay great attention to</p>

      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> III Patient Endurance and Discrimination</p>
      <p> discrimination, since the ability to distinguish between good and evil, and to scrutinize and understand the various tricks through which the devil by means of plausible fantasies leads most people astray, keeps us safe and helps us in every way. If a man wanting to test his wife's virtue comes to her at night disguised as someone else, and she repels him, he will rejoice at this and welcome the assurance it gives. It is exactly the same with us in relation to the attacks of the evil spirits. Even if you repel the heavenly spirits, they will be gladdened by this, and will help you to participate still further in grace: because of this proof of your love for the Lord they will fill you brim-full with spiritual delight. So do not from light-mindedness speedily surrender yourself to the visitations of spirits, even if they are heavenly angels, but be wary, submitting them to the most careful scrutiny. Thus you will welcome the good and repel the evil. In this way you will increase in yourself the workings of grace, which sin, however much it may assume the appearance of the good, cannot altogether simulate. According to St Paul, Satan can even change himself into an angel of light in order to practice his deceptions (cf 2 Cor. 11:14); yet though he may manifest himself in such a glorious manner, he cannot, as we said, produce within us the effects of grace, and so it becomes quite clear that the vision is counterfeit. For the devil cannot bring about love either for God or for one's neighbor, or gentleness, or humility, or joy, or peace, or equilibrium in one's thoughts, or hatred of the world, or spiritual repose, or desire for celestial things; nor can he quell passions and sensual pleasure. These things are clearly the workings of grace. For the fruits of the Spirit are love, joy, peace, and so on (cf. Gal. 5:22), while the devil is most apt and powerful in promoting vanity and haughtiness. You may know from its effect whether the intellectual light shining in your soul is from God or from Satan. Indeed, once it has developed its powers of discrimination, the distinction is immediately clear to the soul itself through intellectual perception. Just as the throat through its sense of taste distinguishes the difference between vinegar and wine, although they look alike, so the soul through its intellectual sense and energy can distinguish the gifts of the Spirit from the fantasies of the devil.</p>
      <p> 46. The soul must watch and anticipate carefully so that it is not even for the twinkling of an eye taken captive by the devil's power. Even if only one part of an animal is caught in a trap, the whole animal is held fast and falls into the hands of the hunters; and the same thing is</p>

      <p> liable to happen to the soul at the hands of its enemies. The psalmist makes this quite clear when he says: 'They prepared a trap for my feet and bowed down my soul' (Ps. 57:6. LXX).</p>
      <p> 47.  He who wants to enter the strong man's house through the narrow gate and to make off with his goods (cf. Matt. 7:14; 12:29) must not surrender to luxury and obesity, but must strengthen himself in the Holy Spirit, having in mind the phrase, 'Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God' (1 Cor. 15:50). But how should he strengthen himself in the Spirit? Here he should heed the words of St Paul, that God's wisdom is regarded as foolishness by men (cf. 1 Cor. 1:23), as well as those of Isaiah, that he had seen the son of man, and His form was despised, and He was forsaken by all the sons of men (cf. Isa. 53:3). Thus he who wants to be a son of God must first humble himself in the same way and be regarded as foolish and despicable, not turning his face aside when spat upon (cf. Isa. 50:6), not pursuing the glory and beauty of this world or anything of this kind, not having anywhere to lay his head (cf Matt. 8:20), vilified, mocked, downtrodden, regarded by all as an object of contempt, attacked invisibly and visibly, yet resisting in his mind. It is then that the Son of God, who said, 'I will dwell and walk among you' (cf. Lev. 26:12), will become manifest in his heart, and he will receive power and strength so that he can tie the strong man up and make off with his goods (cf. Matt. 12:29), and tread upon asp and basilisk (cf. Ps. 91:13. LXX), snakes and scorpions (cf. Luke 10:19).</p>
      <p> 48.  No little struggle is required of us to break through death. Christ says: 'The kingdom of God is within you' (Luke 17:21); but he who fights against us and takes us captive also finds some way of being within us. The soul, therefore, must not rest until it has killed him who takes it prisoner. Then all pain, sorrow and sighing will flee away (cf. Isa. 35:10), because water has sprung up in thirsty earth (cf. Isa. 43:20) and the desert has become full of waters (cf. Isa. 41:18).For He has promised to fill the barren heart with living water, speaking first through the prophet Isaiah, saying: 'I will give water to those who are thirsty and who walk through dry land' (Isa. 44:3. LXX); and then through Himself, with the words: "Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again' (John 4:14).</p>
      <p> 49.  The soul overcome by listlessness is manifestly also possessed by lack of faith. It is on account of this that it lets day after day go by without heeding the Gospels. Not paying attention to the inner</p>

      <p> warfare, it is taken captive by conceit and frequently elated by dreams. Conceit blinds the soul, not letting it perceive its own weakness.</p>
      <p> 50.  As the new-bom child is the image of the fuU-grown man, so the soul is in a certain sense the image of God who created it. The child, on growing up, begins gradually to recognize its father, and when it reaches maturity, they dispose things mutually and equally, father with son and son with father, and the father's wealth is disclosed to the son. Something similar should have happened to the soul. Before the fall, the soul was to have progressed and so to have attained full manhood (cf Eph. 4:13). But through the fall it was plunged into a sea of forgetfulness, into an abyss of delusion, and dwelt within the gates of hell. As if separated from God by a great distance, it could not draw near to its Creator and recognize Him properly. But first through the prophets God called it back, and drew it to knowledge of Himself. Finally, through His own advent on earth. He dispelled the forgetfulness, the delusion; then, breaking through the gates of hell. He entered the deluded soul, giving Himself to it as a model. By means of this model the soul can grow to maturity and attain the perfection of the Spirit. It is therefore for our sakes that the Logos of God is by divine permission tempted by the devil, and then endures vilifications, mockeries, beatings at the hands of savage men, and finally death on the Cross, showing us, as we said, what attitude we must take up towards those who vilify and mock us and bring us to our death. Thus we become as though deaf and dumb before them, not opening our mouth, so that clearly perceiving the subtlety and energy of evil, and as though nailed to the cross, we may call loudly to Him who can deliver us from death (cf. Heb. (5:7) and cleanse us from our secret faults (cf. Ps. 19:12); for "if they do not have dominion over me, then 1 shall be faultless" (Ps. 19:13). When we are faultless we find Him 'who has brought all things into subjection' (Ps. 8:6), and we reign and enjoy repose with Christ. Overpowered through the fall by material and unclean thoughts, the soul became as though witless. As a result, no small effort is needed for it to rise out of materiality and to grasp the subtlety of evil, so that it can commingle with unoriginate Intellect.</p>
      <p> 51.   If you want to return to yourself and to recover your original glory, which you lost through your disobedience, heedlessly paying more attention to the orders and counsel of the devil than to the commandments of God, then you must now have done with him whom you obeyed and turn towards the Lord. But you must know that only</p>

      <p> after much labor and sweat of the brow will you recover your richness. Nor is it to your advantage to attain this blessed state without suffering and great effort, for if you do you will lose what you have received and betray your inheritance to the enemy. Let us each realize, then, what we have lost and repeat the lamentation of the prophet: 'Our inheritance is despoiled by strangers and our house by aliens' (Lam. 5:2), because we disobeyed the commandment and surrendered ourselves to our own desires, delighting in sordid and worldly thoughts. Then our soul was far away from God and we were like fatherless orphans. Thus, if we are concerned for our own soul we must make every effort to purge away evil thoughts and 'all the self-esteem that exalts itself against the knowledge</p>
      <p> of God' (2 Cor. 10:5). And when we have forcibly applied ourselves to keeping God's temple spotless, then He who promised to make His dwelling in it will come to us. Then the soul recovers its inheritance and is privileged to become a temple of God. For, after thus Himself expelling the devil and his army, from henceforth He reigns within us.</p>
      <p> 52.  What the Creator outwardly said to Cain, that he would wander over the earth lamenting and trembling (cf Gen. 4:12. LXX), is in its inner meaning a figure and image of all sinners. For the race of Adam, having broken the commandment and become guilty of sin, is shaken by restless thoughts, full of fear, cowardice and turmoil. Every soul not reborn in God is tossed hither and thither by the desires and multifarious pleasures of the enemy, and whirled about like com in a sieve. To show that those who act in accordance with the desires of the devil bear in themselves the image of Cain's iniquity, the Lord Himself said: 'You seek to carry out the desires of your father, the murderer. He was a murderer from the first and is not rooted in the truth" (cf. John 8:44).</p>
      <p> 53.  It is significant how deeply attracted men are by the spectacle of an earthly king and how eagerly they seek after it; and how everyone who lives in a city where the king has his residence longs to catch a glimpse simply of the extravagance and ostentation of his  entourage.  Only under the influence of spiritual things will they disregard all this and look down on it, wounded by another beauty and desiring a different kind of glory. If the sight of a mortal king is so important to worldly people, how much more desirable must the sight of the immortal king be to those into whom some drops of the Holy Spirit have fallen and whose hearts have been smitten by divine love? For this</p>

      <p> They will relinquish all amity with the world, so that they may keep that longing continually in their hearts, preferring nothing to it. But few indeed there are who add to a good beginning an equivalent end and who endure without stumbling until they reach it. Many are moved to repentance and many become partakers of heavenly grace and are wounded by divine love; but, unable to bear the ensuing tribulations and the wily and versatile assaults of the devil, they submit to the world and are submerged in its depths through the flabbmess and debility of their will, or are taken captive by some attachment to worldly things. Those who wish to pursue the way with assurance to the end will not permit any other longing or love to intermingle with their divine love.</p>
      <p> 54.  Just as the blessings promised by god are unutterably great, so their acquisition requires much hardship and toil undertaken with hope and faith. This is clear from Christ's words: 'if any man will come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me' (matt. 16:24); and: 'he who does not hate father and mother, brothers and sisters, wife and children, and even his own soul, cannot be a disciple of mine' (Luke 14:26). Most people are so lacking in intelligence as to want to attain the great and inconceivable blessing of the kingdom of god, and to inherit</p>
      <p> eternal life and reign for ever with Christ, while living according to their own desires - or rather, according to him who sows within them these clearly noxious vanities.</p>
      <p> 55.  Those who reach the goal without falling do so through hating themselves and all worldly desires, distractions, pleasures and preoccupations, for this is what 'denying oneself amounts to. Hence everyone expels himself from the kingdom by his own choice, through not embracing suffering and denying himself for the sake of the truth, but wanting to enjoy something of this world in addition to that divine longing, and not surrendering the whole inclination of his will to god. This may be understood from a single example. On examining himself a man realizes that what he is so eager to do is wicked. At first he feels doubt about it in his heart. Next, the measure and balance in his conscience make it clear inwardly whether the bias inclines to love for god or love for the world; and after that he proceeds to outward action. If for instance someone happens to have fallen out with his brother, then he examines himself, as we have said. At first he finds himself hesitant about whether to speak or not to speak, whether to return the insults hurled at him or to keep silent. At this point the man still remembers god's commandments, but he also thinks about his</p>
      <p> [V3]309</p>

      <p> own reputation and has not fully chosen to deny himself. If a bias in favor of the world tips his heart's balance even slightly, an evil word will at once be on the tip of his tongue. When this happens, with the intellect stretched inwardly like a bow he attacks his neighbor with his tongue and even with his hands - indeed, the evil can proceed so far that wounds result, or even murder. Thus it is possible to compare the starting-point of the slight movement in his soul with the terrible consequences to which it led. In this way every sin and malpractice, whether adultery, theft, greed, self-esteem or anything else, occurs when the will of the soul is beguiled and coaxed to evil by worldly desires and pleasures of the flesh.</p>
      <p> 56.  Even good actions are frequently carried out for the sake of empty glory, and on this account they will be judged by God in the same way as theft, injustice and other major sins. 'God has scattered the bones of those who seek to please men", it is said (Ps. 53:5. LXX). The devil, being wily, versatile, tortuous and inventive, seeks to gain our allegiance and service even through our good actions.</p>
      <p> 57.  Whenever anyone loves something belonging to this world, it will burden his mind, dragging it down and not allowing it to rise up. In such people the weight, bias and balance of the will, that is, of the heart, are inclined to what is evil. It is in this way that torment and trial afflict the whole human race, whether they are Christians living in cities or on mountains, in monasteries, in the country or the desert. For if one is willingly enticed by what one loves it is clear that one has not yet dedicated all one's love to God. Whether one likes possessions, or gold, or serving</p>
      <p> one's stomach, or indulging in fleshly desires, or wordy wisdom designed to gain men's praise, or authority, or honors from men, or anger and wrath, or useless speeches, or merely day-dreaming and listening to idle words, or acting as a teacher for the sake of men's esteem-in each and every case to give oneself to a passion is manifestly to love it. One person surrenders himself to sluggishness and negligence, another delights in extravagant clothes, another in sleep, another in silly jokes: whatever the worldly thing, big or small, by which one is bound and held fast, it prevents one from raising oneself up. Clearly, we indulge ourselves in whatever passion we do not resist and fight against bravely: like some shackle it binds us and drags us down, degrading the mind so that it does not dedicate itself to God and worship Him alone. The soul that truly directs its desire towards the</p>

      <p> Lord focuses all its longing on Him, denying itself and not following the desires of its own intellect.</p>
      <p> 58.   Example makes it clear that man is destroyed by his own free choice: for out of love for some worldly thing he throws himself into fire, is drowned in the sea and gives himself into captivity. Let us suppose that someone's house or field has caught fire. The person who wanted to save himself fled without anything as soon as he noticed the fire, leaving everything in it and concerned only with his own life. But someone else thought he would take some of the goods with him, so he stayed behind to collect them; and as he was taking them the fire, which had already overwhelmed the house, caught him as well and burnt him. In this way, through his attachment to some transient thing, he was destroyed in the fire by his own free choice. Again, two men were shipwrecked. One of them, wanting to save himself, stripped off his clothes and threw himself into the water; and in this way he was able to save his life. The other, wanting to save his clothes as well, was drowned, destroying himself for the sake of a slight gain. Or again, let us suppose that news of an attack by an enemy was announced. One man, as soon as he heard the news, fled as fast as his feet would carry him, without a thought for his possessions. Another, either because he distrusted the news, or because he wanted to take with him some of his goods, waited until later, and when the enemy arrived he was caught. Thus, through his lack of alertness and his attachment to worldly things, he lost body and soul by his own free choice.</p>
      <p> 59.  Few are those who really acquire perfect love for God, looking upon all worldly pleasures and desires as nothing and patiently enduring the devil's trials. But one must not despair on this account, or give up hope. Even if many ships suffer shipwreck there are always those that come safely through to port. For this reason we need great faith, endurance, attentiveness, struggle, hunger and thirst for what is right, as well as great understanding and discrimination, together with clear-sightedness and lack of shame in making our requests. As we have said, most men want to attain the kingdom without toil and sweat; and although they praise the saints and desire their dignity</p>
      <p> and gifts, they are not willing to share with them in the same afflictions, hardships and sufferings. Everyone -prostitutes, tax-collectors and everyone else - wants this. For this reason, trials and temptations are set before us, so as to make it clear who in truth loves their Lord and deserves to attain the kingdom of heaven.</p>

      <p> 60.  In afflictions and sufferings, endurance and faith, are concealed the promised glory and the recovery of celestial blessings. Even the grain of com sown in the earth, or the graft on a tree, has to go through a kind of putrefaction and, so to say, humiliation before it clothes itself in its full glory and produces a rich crop. But for this putrefaction and, as it were, dishonoring, neither would attain its final glory and beauty. This is confirmed by the apostles when they say that to enter the kingdom of God we have to pass through many afflictions (cf. Acts 14:22). And the Lord Himself says: 'You will gain possession of your souls through your patient endurance' (Luke 21:19); and: "In the world you will experience affliction' (John 16:33).</p>
      <p> 61.  If through faith and effort we are enabled to become partakers of the Holy Spirit, then to a corresponding degree our bodies also will be glorified on the last day. For what is now treasured up within the soul will then be revealed outwardly in the body. Trees provide an illustration of this: once winter is past and the sun shines more brightly and fully and the winds blow benignly, they put forth buds from within and clothe themselves in leaves, flowers and fruits. Similarly, in springtime flowering plants shoot up from the breast of the earth so that the ground is covered with them, wearing them as though they we're a beautiful dress; as Christ says: 'Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these' (Matt. 6:29). All these are types and examples and images of the reward that the redeemed will receive at the resurrection; for to all devout souls - that is to say, to all true Christians - it is in the first month, which is April, that the power of the resurrection is revealed. In the words of Holy Scripture, 'This month .. . will be to you the first among the months of the year' (Exod. 12:2). This month will clothe the naked trees with the glory previously hidden within them. And so, too, will the bodies of the righteous be glorified through the ineffable light - the power of the Spirit-that is already present within them; and this will be to them clothing, food, drink, exultation, joy, peace and, crowning all, life eternal.</p>

      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> 62.   Through the glory of the Spirit that shone from his face in such a way that no one could look at it (cf. Exod. 54:30-31), Moses showed how in the resurrection of the righteous their bodies will be glorified with the glory that their souls already possess inwardly during this present life. For, as St Paul says, 'with unveiled face' - that is to say, inwardly - 'we reflect as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, and are transfigured into the same image from glory to glory' (2 Cor. 3:18). In this connection, too, it is said that Moses did not eat or drink for forty days and forty nights (cf. Exod. 34:28), something that human nature cannot accomplish unless nourished by spiritual food. Such is the food that the souls of the saints already during this present life receive from the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 63.   The glory that in the present life enriches the souls of the saints will cover and enfold their naked bodies at the resurrection and will carry them to heaven. Then with body and soul the saints will rest with God in the kingdom for ever. For God, when He created Adam, did not give him bodily wings, as He gave to the birds: His purpose was to confer the wings of the Spirit on him at the resurrection, so that he might be lifted up by them and carried wherever the Spirit desired. Such spiritual wings are given to the souls of the saints in this present life, so that their understanding may be raised by them to the spiritual realm. For the world of the Christians is a different world, with different garments, different food and a different form of enjoyment. We know that when Christ comes from heaven to resurrect all those who have died during the present age. He will divide them into two groups (cf. Matt. 25:31-33). Those who bear His sign, which is the seal of the Holy Spirit, He will set at His right hand, saying: "My sheep, when they hear My voice, recognize Me' (cf. John 10:14). Then He will envelop their bodies with the divine glory that, through their good works and the Spirit,</p>

      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> their souls have already received in the present life. Thus glorified by the divine light and caught up into the heavens to meet the Lord, they will always be with Him (cf. 1 Thess. 4:17-18).</p>
      <p> 64.  Those who intend to fulfill the Christian way of life to the best of their ability must first devote all their attention to the rational, discriminative and directing aspect of the soul. Per-fecting in this way their discrimination between good and evil, and defending the purity of their nature against the attacks of the passions that are contrary to nature, they go forward without stumbling, guided by the eye of discrimination and not embroiled with the impulses of evil. For the soul's will is able to preserve the body free from the vitiation of the senses, to keep the soul away from worldly distraction, and to guard the heart from scattering its thoughts into the world, completely walling</p>
      <p> them in and holding them back from base concerns and pleasures. Whenever the Lord sees someone acting in this manner, perfecting and guarding himself, disposed to serve Him with fear and trembling. He extends to him the assistance of His grace. But what will God do for the person who willingly gives himself up to the world and pursues its pleasures?</p>
      <p> 65. The five watchful virgins who bore in the vessels of their hearts the oil that was not inherent in their nature -for it is the grace of the Holy Spirit - were able to enter with the bridegroom into the bridal-chamber. But the other foolish and sinful virgins, who remained fixed in their own nature, did not practice watchfulness, nor did they think it important to receive this oil of joyfulness in their hearts, for they still walked according to the flesh. On the contrary, in their negligence, slothfulness and self-righteousness, they were as though asleep, and for this reason they were shut out from the bridal-chamber of the kingdom (cf. Matt. 25:1-13). It is clear that they were held back by some kind of bond and amity with the world, inasmuch as they could not offer all their love and longing to the celestial bridegroom. For souls aspiring to acquire the sanctifying power of the Spirit that is not intrinsic to human nature direct all their love towards Christ: they walk, pray, think and meditate in Christ, and they turn away from everything else. And if the soul's five senses -understanding, spiritual knowledge, discrimination, patient endurance and compassion - receive the grace and sanctification of the Spirit, they will in truth be wise virgins; but if they are left imprisoned in their own nature then they are indeed foolish virgin-children of the world and subject to the wrath of God.</p>

      <p> 66.   Evil is foreign to our nature; but, given admittance by us through the transgression of the first man, it has with time become as though natural to us. Yet through the celestial gift of the Spirit, that is also foreign to our nature, this nature can once more be completely purged of evil and we can be restored to our original purity. But unless this comes about as the result of great supplication, faith and attentiveness, and by our turning away from the things of the world; and unless our nature, denied as it is by evil, is sanctified by the love that is the Lord, and we continue unfailingly to apply ourselves to His divine commandments, we cannot attain the kingdom of Heaven.</p>
      <p> 67.  I wish to elucidate, so far as I can, a subject that is as subtle as it is profound. The infinite and bodiless Lord, who is beyond being, in His infinite bounty embodies and, so to say, reduces Himself so that He can commingle with the intelligible beings that He has created-with, that is, the souls of saints and of angels - thereby making it possible for them to participate in the immortal life of His own divinity. Now each thing - whether angel, soul or demon - is, in conformity with its own nature, a body. No matter how subtle it may be, each thing possesses a body whose subtlety in substance, form and image corresponds to the subtlety of its own nature. In the case of human beings the soul, which is a subtle body, has enveloped and clothed itself in the members of our visible body, which</p>
      <p> is gross in substance. It has clothed itself in the eye, through which it sees; in the ear, through which it hears; in the hand, the nose. In short, the soul has clothed itself in the whole visible body and all its members, becoming commingled with them, and through them accomplishing everything it does in this life. In the same way, in His unutterable and inconceivable bounty Christ reduces and embodies Himself, commingling with and embracing the soul that aspires to Him with faith and love and, as St Paul puts it (cf 1 Cor. 6:17), becoming one spirit with it. His soul united with our soul and His Person with our person. Thus such a soul lives and has its being in His divinity, attaining immortal life and delighting in incorruptible pleasure and inexpressible glory.</p>
      <p> 68. In a soul of this kind the Lord when He wills is fire, consuming every sinful and alien thing in it, in accordance with the words, "Our God is a consuming fire' (Deut. 4:24); at other times He is repose, wondrous and indescribable; or else joy and peace, cherishing and embracing it. Only it must aspire to Him with love and devote Itself</p>

      <p> to holy ways of life, and then through direct experience, with its own perception, it will see itself partaking of unutterable blessings that "the eye has not seen, and the ear has not heard, and man's heart has not grasped' (1 Cor. 2:9). For to the soul that proves itself worthy of Him the Spirit of the Lord is now repose, now intense joy, now delight and life. Just as He embodies Himself in spiritual food, so He embodies Himself in indescribable raiment and beauty, so that He fills the soul with spiritual gladness. As He Himself said: 'I am the bread of life' (John 6:35); and: 'If anyone drinks of the water that I give him ... it will be in him a spring of water welling up for eternal life' (John 4:14).</p>
      <p> 69.   Hence God was seen by each priest and saint as He willed and as was most profitable to the beholder. Thus He was seen in one way by Abraham, in another by Isaac, in another by Jacob, in another by Noah, by Daniel, by Moses, by David and by each of the prophets. He reduced and embodied Himself, giving Himself a different form and appearing to those who loved Him, not as He is in Himself-for He is beyond man's grasp - but according to their capacity and strength; and He did this because of the great, incomprehensible love that He had for them.</p>
      <p> 70.   The soul found worthy to be the dwelling-place of supernal power, and whose members are commingled with that divine fire and with the celestial love of the Holy Spirit, is set free completely from all worldly love. Iron or lead, or gold and silver, melts when put into fire, and its natural solidity is softened, so that it is malleable and pliant so long as it is in the fire. Similarly, once the soul has received the celestial fire of the love of the Spirit, it renounces every attachment to the spirit of this world, breaks free from the bonds of evil, loses the natural obduracy of sin, and regards all worldly things as of no account. So much is this the case that should a soul, conquered by such love, find that certain brothers who are very dear to it impede its dedication to that love, then it will withdraw its affection from them. Nuptial love separates one from the love of father and mother, sister and brother, and any love one may</p>
      <p> bear them will be slight, since one's whole heart and desire are directed towards one's spouse. If earthly love dissolves all other worldly affection in this way, those wounded by that dispassionate longing will not be held back in the least by the love of anything worldly.</p>
      <p> 71.  Being bountiful and full of love. God awaits with great patience the repentance of every sinner, and He celebrates the return of the sinner with celestial rejoicing; as He Himself says, 'There is joy in</p>

      <p> heaven over one sinner who repents' (cf. Luke 15:7,10). But when someone sees this generosity and patience, and how God awaits repentance and so does not punish sins one by one, he may neglect the commandment and make such generosity an excuse for indifference, adding sin to sin, offence to offence, laziness to laziness. In this way he will reach the furthest limits of sin, and fall into such transgression that he is not able to recover himself. On the contrary, sinking into the lowest depths and finally committing himself to the devil, he destroys himself. That is what happened to the people of Sodom: reaching and even going beyond the furthest limits of sin - for not a single spark of repentance was to be found among them - they were consumed by the fire of divine justice (cf Gen. 19:1-28). It also happened in the time of Noah: people had surrendered so unrestrainedly to the impulses to evil, piling up such a load of sin on themselves and showing not the least sign of repentance, that the whole earth became corrupt (cf. Gen. 6:5). Similarly, God was bountiful to the Egyptians, although they had sinned greatly and had maltreated His people: He did not hand them over to total destruction, but through gradual chastisement He induced them to repent. Yet when they lapsed and returned enthusiastically to their evil ways and to their original disbelief, finally even pursuing the Lord's people as they departed from Egypt, divine justice destroyed them completely (cf. Exod. 14:23-28). God also showed His habitual forbearance towards the people of Israel, although they too had sinned greatly and had killed His prophets. Yet when they became so committed to evil that they did not respect even the royal dignity of His Son, but laid murderous hands upon Him, they were utterly rejected and cast aside: prophecy, priesthood and service were taken from them and were entrusted to the Gentiles who believed (cf. Matt. 21:33-43).</p>
      <p> 72.  Let us draw near eagerly to Christ who summons us, surrendering our hearts to Him, and let us not despair of our salvation, deliberately giving ourselves over to evil. For it is a trick of the devil to lead us to despair by reminding us of our past sins. We must realize that if Christ when on earth healed and restored the blind, the paralyzed and the dumb, and raised the dead that were already in a state of decomposition, how much more will He heal blindness of mind, paralysis of soul, and dumbness of the dissolute heart. For He who created the body also created the soul. And if He</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> was so bounteous and merciful to what is mortal and disintegrates, how much more compassionate and healing will He not be to the immortal soul, overpowered by the sickness of evil and ignorance, when it turns to Him and asks Him for help? For it is He who said: "Will not My heavenly Father vindicate those who call to Him night and day? Yes, I assure you. He will vindicate them swiftly' (cf. Luke 18:7-8); and: 'Ask and it will be given to you, seek; and you will find, knock and it will be opened to you" (Matt. 7:7); and again: 'If he will not give to him out of friendship, yet on account of his persistence he will get up and give him what he needs' (cf. Luke 11:8). Moreover, He came so that sinners should turn back to Him (cf. Matt. 9:13). Only let us devote ourselves to the Lord, rejecting in so far as we can our evil prepossessions; and He will not overlook us, but will be ready to offer us His help.</p>
      <p> 73.   When a person is so sick and weak that his body cannot accept food and drink, he is reduced to despair and becomes a living image of death, and his friends and relatives mourn over him. Similarly, God and the angels mourn and are full of sorrow for souls incapable of absorbing celestial nourishment. But if you become God's throne and He Himself takes His seat on it; if your whole soul is a spiritual eye, all light; if you nourish yourself on the sustenance of the Spirit and drink living water and the spiritual wine that rejoices the heart (cf. Ps. 104:15); if you clothe your soul in ineffable light - if inwardly you attain experience and full assurance of all these things, then you will live the truly eternal life, reposing in Christ while still in this present world. If you have not yet attained this state or have not started to acquire it, you should weep bitterly and lament because you still do not as yet possess such riches; and you should constantly be mindful of your poverty and should pray because of it. But even the man who has attained this state should still be aware of his dearth lest, as though sated with divine riches, he becomes negligent. As the Lord says, he who seeks will find and to him who knocks it will be opened (cf. Matt. 7:8).</p>
      <p> 74.  If the oil formed from different spices (cf. Exod. 30:23-25) had such power that those anointed with it attained a royal status (cf. 1 Sam. 10:1; 16:13), will not those whose intellect and inner being are anointed with the sanctifying oil of gladness (cf. Ps. 45:7), and who have received the pledge of the Holy Spirit, even more surely attain the realm of perfection - that is to say, Christ's kingdom and</p>

      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> adoption by Him - and become the King's companions, entering and leaving the Father's presence as they wish? Even if they have not yet entered totally into their inheritance, being still burdened with the weight of the flesh, yet through the pledge of the Spirit they will be fully assured of the things for which they hope, and will not have any doubt that they will reign with Christ and will enjoy the supra-abundant fullness of the Spirit: though still clothed in the flesh, they have had direct experience of that power and that pleasure. For grace, once it has been conferred as a result of the purification of the intellect and the inner being, completely removes the veil in which man was wrapped by Satan after the fall, expelling every defilement and every sordid thought from the soul. Its aim is to cleanse the soul, so enabling it to recover its original nature and to contemplate the glory of the true light with clear, unimpeded eyes. Once this is achieved, man is here and now raised to the eternal world and perceives its beauty and its wonder. Just as the physical eye, as long as it is sound and healthy, gazes confidently at the sun's rays, so such a man, his intellect illumined and purified, always contemplates the never-setting light of the Lord.</p>
      <p> 75.  It is not easy for men to reach this level. It requires much toil, struggle and suffering. In many, although grace is active, evil is still present together with it, lying hidden: the two spirits, that of light and that of darkness, are at work in the same heart. Naturally, you will ask what communion light can have with darkness, or what concord can God's temple have with idols (cf 2 Cor. 6:14,16). I will answer you with the same words: what communion can light have with darkness? Pure and unsullied as it is, in what way is the divine light darkened, obscured or sullied? The light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not grasp it" (John 1:5). Thus things must not be interpreted in isolation or in a single way. Some repose in God's grace only for as long as they can keep a hold over themselves and can avoid being vanquished by the sinfulness dwelling within them: for a time they can pray diligently and are at rest, but then unclean thoughts become active within them and they are taken captive by sin, which in their case clearly coexists with grace. Those who are superficial, and who have not yet grasped the precise degree to which divine energy is active in them, think they have been delivered once and for all from sin; but those who are intelligent and possess discrimination would not deny that, though God's grace dwells</p>
      <p> [V3] 319</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>

      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> within them, they may also be harassed by shameful and unnatural thoughts.</p>
      <p> 76.  We have often known brethren who have enjoyed such richness of grace that all sinful desire has completely dried up and been extinguished in them for five or six years. Then, just when they thought they had reached a haven</p>
      <p> and found peace, evil has leapt upon them as though from an ambush so savagely and with such hostility that they have been thrown into confusion and doubt. No one, therefore, who possesses understanding would dare to say that once grace dwells in him he is thereafter free from sin. As we said, both grace and sin may be active in the same intellect, even if the gullible and ignorant, after having had some slight spiritual experience, claim that they have already won the battle. This, in my opinion, is how things are: dark air or mist suddenly rising may obscure the sun's light even when it is shining brightly; in a similar manner those who, although enjoying God's grace, have not yet been completely purified and in their depths are still under the sway of sin, may also be suddenly overcome by darkness. Truly, it needs great discrimination to perceive these things in one's actual experience in a foolproof way.</p>
      <p> 77.  Just as it is impossible for a person without eyes, tongue, ears and feet, to see, talk, hear or walk, so also it is impossible to commune in the divine mysteries, know God's wisdom or be enriched by the Spirit, without God's help and the energy He gives. The Greek sages were trained in the use of words and engaged spiritedly in verbal battles. The servants of God, even if they lack skill in argument, are familiar in every way with divine knowledge and God's grace.</p>
      <p> 78.   I am convinced that not even the apostles, although filled with the Holy Spirit, were therefore completely free from anxiety. In addition to exultation and inexpressible joy they also felt a certain fear, prompted, to be sure, not from the side of evil but by grace itself; for grace was so securely established within them that they could not in fact deviate at all from the right path. And just as a child by throwing a small pebble does no real harm to a wall, or as a feeble arrow can damage a strong breastplate only very slightly, so even if some evil thing assailed them, the attack proved to be utterly ineffectual and vain, since they were well protected by the power of Christ. Yet even though they were perfect they still possessed their free will; contrary to the stupid view expressed by some, the advent</p>

      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>

      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> of grace does not mean immediate deliverance from anxiety. The Lord asks even from the perfect that the soul's will should serve the Spirit, so that the two come together. "Do not quench the Spirit", says St Paul (1 Thess. 5:19).</p>
      <p> 79.   To explain things in superficial terms is not difficult or troublesome. For example, it is easy for anyone to say that this loaf is made from wheat; yet to expound stage by stage how bread is made lies within the competence not of everyone but only of those with experience. Similarly, it is easy to speak superficially about dispassion and perfection; but the stages by which they are achieved can be truly understood only by those who have attained them in their actual experience.</p>
      <p> 80.  Those who hold forth about spiritual realities without having tasted and experienced them are like a man traversing an empty and arid plain at high noon on a summer's day: in his great and burning thirst he imagines that</p>
      <p> there is a cool spring close at hand, full of sweet clear water, and that there is nothing to prevent him from drinking it to his heart's content. Or they are like a man who, without having tasted a drop of honey, tries to explain to others what its sweetness is like. Such indeed are those who try to introduce others to perfection, sanctity and dispassion without having learnt about these things through their own efforts and direct experience. And had God given them even a slight awareness of the things about which they speak, they would at all events see that the truth about them differs greatly from the explanation that they give. Christianity is liable to be misconstrued little by little in this way, and so turned into atheism. But in reality Christianity is like food and drink: the more a man tastes it, the more he longs for it, until his intellect becomes insatiable and uncontrollable. It is as if one were to offer to a thirsty person a sweet drink such that he would want, not simply to slake his thirst, but to go on drinking more and more because of the pleasure it gave him. These things are not to be understood merely in a theoretical way; they must be achieved within the intellect in a mysterious manner through the activity of the Holy Spirit, and only then can they be spoken about.</p>
      <p> 81.  The Gospel commands everyone categorically to do this or not to do that, thus enabling us to become friends of the loving King. "Do not be angry", it says (cf Matt. 5:22), and, "Do not lust' (cf Matt. 5:28); and, 'If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other cheek as well' (Matt. 5:39). St Paul, following closely in</p>
      <p> [V3] 321</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> the steps of these commandments, teaches how the actual work of purification should take place stage by stage, patiently and with long-suffering: first he nourishes the unmstructed with milk (cf 1 Cor. 3:1-2), next he brings them to maturity (cf Eph. 4:14-15), and then to perfection (cf. Heb. 5:12-14). In this way the Gospel forms as it were a complete woolen garment, while St Paul explains clearly how the wool for this garment is to be carded, woven and made up.</p>
      <p> 82.   There are some who have desisted from outward unchastity, fraud, greed and similar iniquity and who on this account regard themselves as saints, when in fact they are far from being true saints. For evil frequently dwells in the intellects of such people, thriving there and creeping around; and after it has destroyed them it leaves them and goes on its way. The saint is he who is sanctified and totally purified in his inner being. One of the brethren was praying with others when he was seized and taken captive by the divine power, and he saw the heavenly Jerusalem and the resplendent dwelling-places there and the boundless and ineffable light. Then he heard a voice saying that this was the place of repose for the righteous. After this, he became very conceited and full of presumption, and fell deeply into sin and was overcome by many evils. If such a man fell, how can anyone say that because he fasts, lives in voluntary exile, gives away all his property and desists from all outward sins, there is nothing wanting for him to be a saint? For pertection consists not in abstention from outward sins but in the total cleansing of the mind.</p>
      <p> 83.   Understanding these things, enter within yourself by keeping watch over your thoughts, and scrutinize closely your intellect, captive and slave to sin as it is. Then discover, still more deeply within you than this, the serpent that nestles in the inner chambers of your soul and destroys you by attacking the most sensitive aspects of your soul. For truly the heart is an immeasurable abyss. If you have destroyed that serpent, have cleansed yourself of all inner lawlessness, and have expelled sin, you may boast in God of your purity; but if not, you should humble yourself because you are still a sinner and in need, and ask Christ to come to you on account of your secret sins. The whole Old and New Testament speaks of purity, and everyone, whether Jew or Greek, should long for purity even though not all can attain it. Purity of heart can be brought about only by Jesus; for He is authentic and absolute Truth, and without this Trath it is impossible to know the truth or to achieve salvation.</p>
      <p> [V3] 322</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>

      <p> 84.  Having outwardly renounced visible things and given away your goods, you must in the same way also renounce your inner prepossessions and attitudes. If you have acquired worldly wisdom or material knowledge, you must reject it. If you have put your trust in earthly privileges, give them up, humbling and belittling yourself. In this way you can discover what St Paul meant by the 'folly' of the Gospel; for in this folly you will find true wisdom, which resides not in fine words but in the power of the Cross that is active as an actual reality in those found worthy to achieve such wisdom. As St Paul says, Christ's Cross is "a stumbling-block to the Jews and folly to the Greeks, but to those who are saved it is God's power and wisdom' (cf 1 Cor. 1:21-24).</p>
      <p> 85.  Even if you have tasted things celestial and partaken of divine wisdom, and your soul is at rest, do not exalt yourself or grow overconfident, thinking that you have already reached your goal and understand all truth, lest St Paul's words also apply to you: "You are sated already, you are already rich, you have reigned as kings without us. Would that you did reign, so that we could reign with you' (1 Cor. 4:8). Even if you have been given some taste, regard yourself as still not yet a Christian; and do not just think this superficially, but let it be as though planted and established permanently in your mind.</p>
      <p> 86.   A lover of riches is never satisfied, no matter how many possessions he accumulates, but the more he acquires daily, the more his appetite increases; and a person forcibly pulled away from a stream of pure water before he has quenched his thirst feels even more thirsty. In a similar way, once one has experienced the taste of God, one can never be satisfied or have enough of it, but however much one is enriched by this wealth one still feels oneself to be poor. Christians do not set great store by their own lives, but regard themselves rather as rightly set at nought by God and as everyone's</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> servants. God rejoices greatly at this, and takes His repose in the soul because of its humility. If therefore you attain something or are enriched, do not on this account presume you are something or have something. Presumption is an abomination to the Lord, and it was this that originally expelled man from paradise when he heard the serpent say, 'You will be like gods' (Gen. 3:5), and put his trust in this vain hope. Have you not learnt how your God and King, and the very Son of God, emptied Himself and took on the form of a slave (cf Phil. 2:7)? How He became poor, was ranked among criminals, and suffered? If this is what happened to God, do you think that man. formed of flesh and blood, who is but earth and ashes, totally without goodness and wholly depraved, has reason to be proud and boastful? If you have understanding you will recognize that even what you have received from God is not your own, since you were given it by another; and should He think fit, it will certainly be taken away from you again. Attribute, therefore, every blessing to God and every evil to your own weakness.</p>
      <p> 87.   That treasure which St Paul said we hold in pots of clay (cf. 2 Cor. 4:7) is the sanctifying power of the Spirit which while still in the flesh he was enabled to receive. Again St Paul says:'... who has been made by God our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption' (1 Cor. 1:30). He who finds and possesses this supernal treasure of the Spirit can accomplish all righteous acts and works prescribed by the commandments, not only in purity and faultlessly, but also without any suffering or exertion, whereas before he was far from accomplishing them in such a painless way. For no one, however he tries, can truly cultivate spiritual fruits before participating in the Holy Spirit But everyone should put pressure on himself, striving to advance with endurance and faith, and fervently beseeching Christ that he may acquire this heavenly treasure; for in it and through it he can accomplish, as was said, every righteous act in purity and perfectly, without toil or distress.</p>
      <p> 88.   Whenever those who possess in themselves the divine riches of the Spirit take part in spiritual discussion, they draw as it were on their inner treasure-house and share their wealth with their hearers. Those, however, who do not have stored in the sanctuary of their heart the treasure from which springs forth the bounty of divine thoughts, mysteries and inspired words, but who cull what they say from the Scriptures, speak merely from the tip of the tongue; or if</p>

      <p> Love</p>
      <p> they have listened to spiritual men, they preen themselves with what others have said, putting it forward as though it were their own and claiming interest on someone else's capital. Their listeners can enjoy what they say without great effort, but they themselves, when they have finished speaking, prove to be like paupers. For they have simply repeated what they have taken from others, without acquiring treasures of their own from which they could first derive pleasure themselves and which they could then communicate profitably to others. For this reason we must first ask God that these true riches may dwell within us, and then we can readily benefit others and speak to them of spiritual matters and divine mysteries. For God's goodness delights to dwell in every believer. As Christ said: 'He who loves Me will be loved by My Father; and I will love him and disclose Myself to him' (John 14:21); and again: 'I and My Father will come to him, and take up Our abode with him' (John 14:23).</p>
      <p> 89. Those who are privileged to become children of God and to have Christ shining forth within them are guided by varied and differing qualities of the Spirit, and are cherished by grace in the secret places of the heart. The seeming joys of the world arc not to be compared with the experience of divine grace in the soul. Those who share in this grace are sometimes filled with an inexpressible and nameless joy and exultation, as if they were at some royal banquet; sometimes they feel like bride and bridegroom delighting together spiritually; and sometimes like bodiless angels, since the body has become so weightless and light that it seems that they are not clothed with it. Sometimes it seems that they are in some realm greatly rejoicing and drunk with the inexpressible drunkenness of the mysteries of the Spirit; and then at other times they are full of grief, weeping and lamenting as they intercede for man's salvation. For, burning with the divine love of the Spirit for all men, they take into themselves the grief of all Adam; and sometimes they are kindled by the Spirit with such untold love and delight that, were it at all possible, they would clasp everyone to their breast, not making any distinction between who is good and who is bad; and sometimes they so disparage themselves that they regard themselves as the least of all men. Now they are consumed with unutterable spiritual joy; and now, like some mighty warrior donning royal armor, marching to war and putting the enemy to flight, they arm themselves with the weapons of the Spirit, attack their invisible enemies and tread them</p>
      <p> [V3] 325</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>

      <p> Love</p>
      <p> underfoot. Now they are embraced by great tranquility and stillness, peace nourishes them and they experience great</p>
      <p> delight; and now they acquire understanding, divine wisdom and unsearchable spiritual knowledge. In short, it is impossible to describe the grace of Christ by which they are illumined. At other times they can appear to be like any ordinary person. Divine grace, taking in them many different forms, teaches and disciplines the soul so as to present it perfect, pure and spotless to the heavenly Father.</p>
      <p> 90.  All these workings of the Spirit are characteristic of those at a high level and very close to perfection. For these manifold blessings of grace are variously but unceasingly made active in such people by the Spirit, one spiritual energy succeeding another. When the soul attains spiritual perfection, totally purged of all the passions and wholly united and commingled with the Holy Spirit, the Intercessor, in ineffable communion, then through this commingling with the Spirit the soul is itself enabled to become spirit: it becomes all light, all spirit, all joy, repose, exultation, all love, all tenderness, all goodness and kindness. It is as though it had been swallowed up in the virtues belonging to the power of the Holy Spirit as a stone in the depths of the sea is surrounded by water. Totally united in this way to the Holy Spirit, such people are assimilated to Christ Himself, maintaining the virtues of the Spirit immutable in themselves and revealing their fruits to all. Since through the Spirit they have been made inwardly spotless and pure in heart, it is impossible for them to produce outwardly the fruits of evil: always and through all things the fruits of the Spirit will be manifest in them. Such is the state of spiritual perfection, such the fullness of Christ that St Paul exhorts us to attain when he says:  "...  so that you may be filled with the whole fullness of Christ' (cf. Eph. 3:19); and again: "... until we all attain to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ'(Eph. 4:13).</p>
      <p> 91.  There are times when, simply after kneeling down, we find our heart filled with divine energy and our soul delights in the Lord as a bride with the bridegroom: in Isaiah's words, 'As the bridegroom delights in the bride, so will the Lord delight in you' (Isa. 62:5. LXX). A man may be occupied throughout the day, and devote himself for but a single hour to prayer, and still be carried away inwardly by it, entering into the infinite depths of the other world. He experiences then an ineffable and measureless delight; his intellect, wholly suspended and ravished, is overwhelmed, and during the time</p>
      <p> [V3] 326</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> he is in this state he is mindless of every worldly concern. For his thoughts are filled, as we said, with numberless incomprehensible realities and are taken captive by them. In that hour his soul through prayer becomes one with his prayer and is carried away with it.</p>
      <p> 92.   If it is asked whether it is possible for such a person always to be in this state, it should be said that he is never without grace; it is rooted and established in him as though it were part of his nature. Although single, it adapts itself in many ways, according to what is most profitable for him. Sometimes its fire bums in him strongly, sometimes</p>
      <p> faintly; and its light sometimes shines brightly and sometimes diminishes and wanes, always as God wills, even though the lamp itself bums inextinguishably. When it shines more vividly, then the man himself appears even more intoxicated with God's love. Sometimes the fire that bums unceasingly in the heart manifests itself with a more inward and deeper light, so that the whole man, swallowed up by this sweetness and vision, is no longer in himself, but seems to the world like an uncouth fool because of the overpowering love and delight that floods his soul, and because of the deep mysteries which he has been privileged to share. It often happens at such a time that he attains the measure of perfection and is free and secure from all sinfulness. Afterwards, grace contracts in a certain manner, and the veil of the contrary power spreads itself over him.</p>
      <p> 93.   Grace operates in the following way. Suppose that a person attains perfection on ascending to the twelfth step. You reach this level and remain there for a time; but grace again withdraws, so you go down one step, and stand on the eleventh. The wonders of the higher step have been revealed to you, and you have had experience of them. But if you had remained on that step for ever, it would not have been possible for you to submit to the charge and burden of teaching; you would not have been able to hear or speak anything, or to concern yourself with the least thing, but could only have lain in some comer, enraptured and intoxicated. You were not allowed to remain on that final step so that you would have time to devote to the care and instruction of the brethren.</p>
      <p> 94.   If on hearing about the kingdom of heaven we are brought to tears, do not let us be content with these tears, or think that we hear well with our ears or see well with our eyes, and that we need nothing further. For there are other ears, other eyes, other tears, just as there is another mind and another soul. I am referring to the divine</p>

      <p> and heavenly Spirit, that hears and weeps, prays and knows, and that truly carries out God's will. When the Lord promised the great gift of the Spirit to the apostles. He said: 'I am going; but the Intercessor, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in My name, will teach you everything' (John 14:26); and: 'I still have much to tell you, but its burden is more than you can bear now. When, however. He who is the Spirit of truth comes. He will guide you into all the truth' (John 16:12-13). He, therefore, will pray, and He will weep. For, as St Paul says, 'we do not know what to pray for as we should; but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with cries that cannot be uttered' (Rom. 8:26). God's will is clear only to the Spirit. Again, as St Paul says: 'No one but the Spirit of God knows about the things of God' (1 Cor. 2:11). When, as promised, on the day of Pentecost the Paraclete made Himself present and the power of the Holy Spirit came to dwell in the souls of the apostles, the veil of sinfulness was once and for all removed from them, their passions were annulled and the eyes of their heart were opened. Henceforth they were filled with wisdom and made perfect by the Spirit: through Him they knew how to carry out God's will, and through Him they were initiated into all truth, for He directed and reigned in their souls. Thus, when we are brought to tears</p>
      <p> on hearing God's word, let us entreat Christ with unwavering faith and in the expectation that the Spirit, who truly hears and prays according to God's will and purpose, will indeed come to us.</p>
      <p> 95.  There is a certain cloud-like power, fine as air, that lightly covers the intellect; and even though the lamp of grace always bums and shines in a man, as we said, yet this power covers its light like a veil in such a way that he is forced to confess that he is not perfect or wholly free from sin, but is, so to speak, both free and not free. This, certainly, does not happen without God's assent but is, on the contrary, in accordance with divine providence. Sometimes the dividing wall (cf. Eph. 2:14) is loosened and shattered, sometimes it is not entirely broken down. Nor is prayer always equally effective: sometimes grace is kindled more brightly, confers greater blessings, and refreshes more fully, and sometimes it is duller and less strong, as grace itself ordains according to what is of most profit to the person concerned. At certain times I have attained the level of perfection and have tasted and experienced the age to be; but never yet have I known any Christian who is perfect or absolutely free. Even if one</p>

      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>

      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> finds refreshment in grace and is enabled to share in mysteries and revelations, and experiences the great sweetness of grace, sin still dwells within one. Those who because of surpassing grace and the light that shines within them think that they are perfect and free do so from lack of experience. As 1 have said, I have never yet encountered anyone who was absolutely free; but, having at certain times partially attained that level of which I have spoken, I know from experience what the perfected man is.</p>
      <p> 96.   Whenever you hear about the communion of bridegroom and bride, about dancing, music and feasting, do not take these things in a material or worldly manner: they are spoken of simply by way of illustration, as a condescension to our understanding. For the things they denote are spiritual and inexpressible, indiscernible to corporeal eyes, and these illustrations help holy and faithful souls to perceive what is meant. The communion itself of the Holy Spirit, celestial treasures, the dances and festivals of the angels-these things are clear only to those who have experience of them; to the uninitiated they are totally beyond comprehension. Thus you must listen with reverence to what is said about them, until through faith you are enabled to attain them; then you will know, with the actual experience of the soul's eyes, in what blessings and mysteries the souls of Christians can share even during this present life. When in the resurrection their body becomes spiritual, it too is enabled to attain, behold and, so to speak, grasp these things.</p>
      <p> 97.  When our soul's own intrinsic qualities and fruits-prayer, love, faith, vigilance, fasting and the other expressions of the virtues-mingle and commune in the fellowship of the Spirit, they effuse a rich perfume, like burning incense. At the same time it then becomes easy for us to live in accordance with God's will, whereas without the Holy Spirit this is impossible, as we have already said. Before a woman is married she acts in accordance with</p>
      <p> her own will and desires; but once married she lives under the direction of her husband, abandoning her self-will. Similarly the soul has its own will, and its own laws and activities; but when it becomes worthy of uniting with Christ the heavenly bridegroom, it submits to His law and is obedient no longer to its own will but to that of Christ.</p>
      <p> 98. The wedding garment about which Christ speaks (cf. Matt. 22:11-12) signifies the grace of the Holy Spirit: the man who is not</p>
      <p> [V3] 329</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>

      <p> Love</p>
      <p> worthy of wearing it has no part in the celestial marriage and in the spiritual wedding-feast.</p>
      <p> 99.  We should eagerly drink spiritual wine and become drunk with a sober-minded drunkenness so that, just as those glutted with ordinary wine become more talkative, we too, brim-full with this spiritual wine, may speak of the divine mysteries. Thy cup has made me drunk as with the strongest wine', says the psalmist (Ps. 23:5. LXX).</p>
      <p> 100.  The soul that is 'poor in spirit' (Matt. 5:3) is aware of its own wounds, perceives the encompassing darkness of the passions, and always calls upon the Lord for deliverance. It endures suffering, and does not delight in any of the good things of this world, but seeks out only the good doctor and entrusts itself to His treatment. How can the wounded soul become fair and seemly, and fit to live with Christ, except by truly recognizing its wounds and poverty and by recovering the state in which it was originally created? If it does not take pleasure in the wounds and weals of the passions, or defend its faults, the Lord will not call it to account for these things, but will come and heal it, restoring its dispassion and its incorruptible beauty. Only it must not deliberately associate with past acts of passion or give its consent to the passions that are still active within it; but with all its strength it must call upon the Lord, so that through His Holy Spirit it may be granted liberation from all the passions. Such is the soul that is called blessed; but alas for the soul that is unaware of its wounds and that in its endless sinfulness and obduracy does not think that it has anything evil within it: the good doctor will not visit it or heal it, since it does not seek Him out or have any concern for its wounds, because it thinks it is well and in good health. As the Lord said: 'It is not the healthy that need a doctor, but the sick' (Matt. 9:12).</p>
      <p> 101.  Truly blessed and zealous for life and for surpassing joy are those who through fervent faith and virtuous conduct receive consciously and expenentially the knowledge of the celestial mysteries of the Spirit and whose citizenship is in heaven (cf Phil. 3:20). Clearly they excel all other men; for who among the powerful or the wise or the prudent could ascend to heaven while still on earth, and perform spiritual works there and have sight of the beauty of the Spirit'? Such a person may appear poor, utterly poor, may be regarded as nothing and be totally unrecognized by his neighbors; but falling on his face before the Lord he rises to heaven under the guidance of</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> the Spirit and with assurance of soul, dehghting in his mind with its wonders, occupying himseh" there, hving there, having his citizenship there, as St Paul puts it. For he says: 'Our citizenship is in heaven' (Phil. 3:20); and he also says: 'The eye has not seen, and the ear has not heard, and man's heart has not grasped the things that God has prepared for those who love Him. But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit' (1 Cor. 2:9-10). These are the truly wise and powerful, these are the noble and the prudent.</p>
      <p> 102. Even apart from these celestial gifts distinguishing the saints from other living people, there are further ways of recognizing their superiority. For instance, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, summoned to him all the peoples to worship the image that he had set up (cf Dan. 3:1-30). But God in His wisdom so disposed things that the virtue of three children should be made known to everyone and should teach everyone that there is one true God, who dwells in the heavens. Three children, captive and deprived of their liberty, spoke out boldly before him; and while everyone else, in great fear, worshipped the image, and even if not convinced did not dare to say anything, but was virtually speechless, like beasts dragged along by the nose, these children behaved very differently. They did not want their refusal to worship the image to go unrecognized or to escape notice, but they declared in the hearing of all: 'We do not worship your gods, 0 king, nor will we bow down before the golden image that you have set up.' Yet the terrible furnace into which they were cast as punishment was not a furnace for them and did not manifest its normal function; but as if reverencing the children it kept them free from harm. And everyone, including the king himself, through them recognized the true God. Not only those on earth, but the angelic choirs themselves were amazed at these children. For the angels are not absent when the saints perform their acts of courage, but keep them company, as St Paul confirms when he says: 'We have become a spectacle... to angels and men' (1 Cor. 4:9). Another example of how saints are to be distinguished is that of Elijah who, though but a single man, prevailed over a great number of false prophets when the fire came down from heaven (cf. 1 Kgs. 18:38). And Moses prevailed over all Egypt and Pharaoh the tyrant (cf. Exod. chs. 5-13). Similarly Lot (cf. Gen. ch. 19) and Noah (cf. Gen. chs. 6-7) and many others, despite their apparent weakness, overcame many powerful and notable people.</p>
      <p> [V3] 331</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>

      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> 103.   Unless something of a different nature comes to its help, every phenomenon retains its inherent imperfection and deficiency. Thus God's inexpressible wisdom has shown forth in symbols and images through visible things that human nature in itself cannot manifest the full glory of the virtues and the spiritual beauty of holiness unless it has the assistance of God's helping hand. If the earth abides by itself, not receiving the farmer's attention and the assistance of rain and sun, it is unfit and incapable of bearing fruit; and every house would be filled with darkness but for the light of the sun, which is not of its own nature; and other things are in a similar state. In the same way, human nature, which in itself is powerless to produce the fruits of the virtues in their full perfection, needs the spiritual husbandman of our souls; in other words, it needs the Spirit of Christ, and this Spirit is of a totally different nature from our own, for we are created while He is uncreated. Skillfully tilling the hearts of the faithful so that they surrender their whole will to Him, He enables them to produce perfect spiritual fruits, while He makes His light shine in the soul's dwelling-place that has been darkened by the passions.</p>
      <p> 104.  The warfare and struggle in which Christians are engaged is twofold. First, it is against visible things, for these excite, titillate and entice the soul to become attached to them and to take pleasure in them. And, second, it is against the principalities and powers of the terrible lord of this world (cf. Eph. 6:12).</p>
      <p> 105.  The glory that shone from the face of Moses (cf. Exod. 34:29-30) was a prefiguring of the true glory of the Holy Spirit. Just as it was impossible then for anyone to gaze at it, so now the darkness of the passions cannot bear the same glory shining in the souls of Christians, but is put to flight, repulsed by its brilliance.</p>
      <p> 106.  The truly sincere and devout Christian who has tasted the sweetness of divine things, whose soul is infused and mingled with grace, and who has entrasted his whole being to the purposes of grace, hates every worldly thing. Whether it is gold or silver, honor or glory, esteem or praise, or anything else, he is superior to it, and none of these things is able to captivate him; for he has experienced other riches and another honor and glory, his soul is nourished by an incorruptible delight, and through the fellowship of the Spirit he has full and conscious assurance.</p>
      <p> 107.  In understanding, spiritual knowledge and discrimination, such a person differs as much from other men as an intelligent</p>
      <p> [V3] 332</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> herdsman differs from witless cattle; for he partakes of another Spirit and another intellect, of another understanding, and of a wisdom that is not the wisdom of this world. As St Paul says: 'We proclaim wisdom to those who are perfect; not the wisdom of this world, or of the doomed rulers of this world; but we proclaim the secret</p>
      <p> wisdom of God' (cf 1 Cor. 2:6-7). For this reason, such a person differs in everything from those who are dominated by the spirit of the world, however intelhgent or wise they are. Again as St Paul says (cf. 1 Cor. 2:15), he judges all men, he knows from what source he speaks and where he stands and among whom he is. Those dominated by the spirit of the world, on the other hand, have no power to know and judge him; this is possible only for one who possesses as he does the Spirit of divinity. As St Paul puts it: 'We interpret spiritual things to those who possess the Spirit. The worldly man does not accept spiritual things: they are folly to  him...  But the spiritual man judges all things, while he is himself judged by no one' (1 Cor. 2:13-15).</p>
      <p> 108.  It is altogether impossible to attain the Holy Spirit unless you alienate yourself from all the things of this world and dedicate yourself to the pursuit of Christ's love. The intellect must divest itself of every material concern and give its attention solely to achieving this one goal, thus becoming worthy of uniting in one spirit with Christ. As St Paul writes: 'He who cleaves to the Lord becomes one spirit with Him' (1 Cor. 6:17). The soul that is wholly attached to some worldly thing like riches or glory or natural affection is not able to escape and transcend the darkness of the powers of evil.</p>
      <p> 109.   Truly sincere and devout souls cannot endure even a slight slackening of their longing for the Lord but, with their attention riveted entirely to His Cross, they seek to grow ever more fully conscious of their spiritual progress. Wounded by their longing and, so to speak, hungering for the righteousness of the virtues and the illumination of the Holy Spirit, they place no reliance on themselves and do not think they are anything even though they have been vouchsafed divine mysteries and partake of celestial felicity and grace. But the more they are enabled by grace to receive spiritual gifts, the more insatiable and diligent becomes their pursuit of heavenly realities; and the more they are aware of their spiritual progress, the more fervent grows their desire to participate in these realities. Spiritually enriched, they feel themselves to be poor. As Scripture</p>
      <p> [V3] 333</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> puts it: 'Those who eat Me will still be hungry and those who drink Me will still be thirsty' (Ecclus. 24:21).</p>
      <p> 110.  Such souls are not only granted complete freedom from the passions but also perfectly acquire the illumination and communion of the Holy Spirit in the fullness of grace. But souls that are sluggish and indolent and do not seek in this life, and while still in the flesh, to achieve through patient endurance and long-suffering the heart's sanctrfication not just partially but totally, cannot hope to commune in the Holy Spirit with full consciousness and assurance, or to be delivered from the passions of evil through the Spirit. Such sluggish and indolent souls, even though granted divine grace, are deceived by evil and cease to trouble themselves further: because they have received grace and enjoy the solace and spiritual sweetness that it confers, they grow complacent, not mortifying their heart or humbling their thought, and not thirsting and aspiring after the full measure of dispassion. Content</p>
      <p> with this slight solace of grace, they progress not in humility but in self-inflation, and are sometimes stripped even of the gift they have been given. With the truly devout soul it is different: even if it practices a thousand works of righteousness, crushes the body with extreme fasting and the most demanding vigils, and is vouchsafed various gifts, revelations and mysteries of the Spirit, it is so modest that it feels it has not yet even embarked on the spiritual path or acquired any of the virtues; and it craves insatiably for divine love.</p>
      <p> 111.   No one can attain such a state as this swiftly or easily: it can only be reached by way of many hardships and struggles, after much time and diligence, testing and temptation, thus bringing one to the full measure of dispassion. It is he who has thus been sifted by every kind of suffering and tribulation, and who has courageously endured all the trials of evil, that is finally found worthy to receive the great blessings, gifts and riches of the Spirit and to inherit the kingdom of heaven.</p>
      <p> 112.  The soul that has not yet acquired this citizenship in heaven and is not yet conscious of the heart's sanctification should be full of sorrow and should implore Christ fervently, that it may attain this blessing as well as the energy of the Spirit that is manifest in the intellect in the form of inexpressible visions. According to ecclesiastical law, those who are conquered by bodily sins are initially excluded from communion by the priest; then, when they have</p>
      <p> [V3] 334</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> shown the appropriate repentance, they are allowed to communicate once more. Those, however, who have not stumbled but have lived in purity may advance to priesthood and take their place within the sanctuary, officiating before the Lord at the Liturgy. We can apply the same distinction to inner communion in the Holy Spirit. Speaking of this, St Paul says: 'The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God the Father, and communion in the Holy Spirit...' (2 Cor. 15:14). Thus the Holy Trinity dwells in the pure soul, divine grace assisting. It dwells in the soul, not as it is in itself, for the Trinity is infinite and cannot be embraced by any created thing, but according to man's capacity and receptivity. Whenever the intellect turns aside from the pursuit of God's will and purpose, and grieves the Spirit, it is cast out and excommunicated from spiritual felicity: God's grace and love, and all the energy of the Holy Spirit, withdraw, and the intellect is delivered up to afflictions, trials and evil powers until the soul again walks in the path of the Spirit. When through confession and self-abasement it has shown that it is repentant, then it is again enabled to receive the visitation of grace and celestial felicity, even more than before. But should the soul not grieve the Spirit in any way, but live acceptably, rejecting every evil thought and cleaving continually to the Lord, rightly and fittingly will it go forward, receiving unutterable gifts and advancing from glory to glory and from peace to greater peace. Finally, when it has attained the full measure of the Christian life, it will be ranged among the perfect liturgists and faultless ministers of Christ in His eternal kingdom.</p>
      <p> 113.  Visible things are figures and reflections of invisible things. Thus the visible church figures and reflects the church of the heart, the visible priest the true priest of Christ's grace; and so on. In the visible church, if the readings, psalms and other parts of the appointed rite do not succeed one another in the proper sequence, then it is not possible for the priest to proceed with the celebration of the divine sacrament of Christ's body and blood; and even if the rest of the order of the service is properly carried out, but the mystical thanksgiving of the sacrifice is not offered by the priest and there is no communion in the body of Christ, then the ecclesiastical rite has not been fulfilled and again the celebration of the sacrament is deficient. One must look on the life of the Christian in a similar way. He may have fasted, kept vigils, chanted the psalms, carried out every ascetic practice and acquired every virtue; but if the mystic working of the</p>
      <p> [V3] 335</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the HomiHes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> Spirit has not been consummated by grace with full consciousness and spiritual peace on the altar of his heart, all his ascetic practice is ineffectual and virtually fruitless, for the joy of the Spirit is not mystically active in his heart.</p>
      <p> 114.   Fasting is good and so are vigils, ascetic practice and voluntary exile. But all these things are but the start, the prelude to the citizenship of heaven, so that it is altogether senseless to put one's trust merely in them. It sometimes happens that we attain a certain state of grace but that evil, as we said above, lying in ambush within us, plays a trick on us: it deliberately withdraws and remains inactive, thus making us think that our intellect has been cleansed. In this way it produces in us the self-conceit of perfection, whereupon it stealthily attacks us and carries us down to the lowest depths of the earth. It often happens that young soldiers or brigands resort to tricks against the enemy: they set up ambushes and, catching their opponents unexpectedly from behind and surrounding them, they slaughter them. If that is what they do, then how much more skilled must evil be, that has dedicated itself for thousands of years to the crucial task of destroying souls. It knows exactly how to devise such ambushes in the secret places of the heart, sometimes keeping quiet and inactive deliberately in order to entice the soul into the self-conceit of perfection. Indeed, the cardinal rule of the Christian life is not to put one's trust in acts of righteousness even if one practices all of them, or to imagine that one has done anything great; and even if one participates in grace, one must not think that one has achieved anything or reached the goal. On the contrary, one should then hunger and thirst, grieve and weep even more, and be totally contrite in heart.</p>
      <p> 115.  The spiritual state is like some royal palace that possesses many exterior courts, vestibules and outer residences; then there are various inner buildings, usually housing the royal robes and the treasure; and then, yet farther within, are the king's living quarters. Someone still in the outer courts and apartments may think he has reached the inner chambers, but he would be wrong. The same is true where the spiritual life is concerned. Those struggling against greed and sleep, and continually occupied with psalms and prayers, should not think that they</p>
      <p> have already attained the final place of rest: they are still in the exterior courts and vestibules, and have not even reached the place where the royal robes and treasure are kept. Even if</p>
      <p> [V3] 336</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the HomiHes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> V</p>
      <p> Love</p>
      <p> they are found worthy of some spiritual grace, again this should not deceive them into thinking that they have attained their goal. They must examine to see whether they have found the treasure in the pot of clay (cf. 2 Cor. 4:7), whether they have put on the purple robe of the Spirit, whether they have seen the king and are at peace.</p>
      <p> Again, our soul has depths and many faculties. When sin insinuates itself, it lays hold of all these faculties and all the heart's thoughts. Then we ask for the grace of the Spirit: it is granted and perhaps embraces two of the soul's faculties. If we lack experience we fancy that this grace we have invoked has laid hold of all the soul's faculties and that sin has been completely uprooted; we do not realize that most of our soul is still subject to sin. For, as has been shown many times, it is possible for grace to be ceaselessly active, as the eye is in the body, and yet for the evil that despoils the mind to coexist with it. Hence, if we do not know how to discriminate, we fancy that we have attained something great and begin to think highly of ourselves, deluding ourselves that we have reached the final stage of purification, though this is very far from the truth. As has been said, one of the devil's ploys is to withdraw deliberately for a certain time and to remain inactive, thus promoting the conceit of perfection in those pursuing the spiritual way. But does the man who plants a vineyard immediately gather grapes? Or does he who sows seeds in the earth at once reap the harvest? Does the new-bom child attain maturity straight away? Think how Jesus Christ, the Son of God and God Himself, descended from the heights of glory to suffering, dishonor, crucifixion and death; and how because of this self-abasement He was taken up again and set at the right hand of the Father. But the evil serpent, that first sowed in Adam the desire for divinity (cf. Gen. 3:5), dragged him down into disgrace through this presumption. Think about these things and try to protect yourself as much as you can, keeping your heart always in a state of humility and contrition.</p>

      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> 116.  When you hear that Christ descended into hell in order to deliver the souls dwelling there, do not think that what happens now is very different. The heart is a tomb and there our thoughts and our intellect are buried, imprisoned in heavy darkness. And so Christ comes to the souls in hell that call upon Him, descending, that is to say, into the depths of the heart; and there He commands death to release the imprisoned souls that call upon Him, for He has power to deliver us. Then, lifting up the heavy stone that oppresses the soul, and opening the tomb. He resurrects us - for we were truly dead - and releases our imprisoned soul from its lightless prison.</p>
      <p> 117.  It often happens that Satan will insidiously commune with you in your heart and say: 'Think of the evil you have done; your soul is full of lawlessness, you are weighed down by many grievous sins.' Do not let him deceive you when he does this and do not be led to despair on the pretext that you are being humble. After gaining admission through the fall evil has the power to commune at all times with the soul, as man to man, and so to suggest sinful actions to it. You should answer it: 'I have God's written assurance, for He says: "I desire, not the sinner's death, but that he should return through repentance and live'" (cf Ezek. 33:11). What was the purpose of His descent to earth except to save sinners, to bring light to those in darkness and life to the dead?'</p>
      <p> 118.  Just as the power of evil works by persuasion, not by compulsion, so does divine grace. In this way our liberty and free will are preserved. If a man commits sins when he is subject to the devil, he himself pays the penalty, not the devil, since he was impelled to evil not by force but by his own will. It is the same where a good action is concerned: grace does not ascribe this action to itself but to the man, giving him the credit for it, since he is the cause of the goodness that befalls him. Grace does not make a man incapable of sin</p>

      <p> by forcibly and compulsonly laying hold of his will but, though present, allows him freedom of choice, so as to make it clear whether the man's own will inclines to virtue or to evil. For the law looks not to man's nature but to his free power of choice, which is capable of turning towards either good or evil.</p>
      <p> 119.  One must guard the soul and not allow it to commune with impure pernicious thoughts. Just as the body is defiled through intercourse with another body, so the soul is corrupted through coupling with evil and polluted thoughts, assenting to them and uniting with them. Not simply thoughts of cunning and unchastity, but of every vice: unbelief, guile, self-esteem, anger, envy, contentiousness and so on. That is what St Paul means when he says: 'Let us cleanse ourselves from all pollution of the flesh and spirit' (2 Cor. 7:1). For corruption and unchastity work also through shameless thoughts in the hidden places of the soul; and just as God will destroy the person who destroys</p>
      <p> His temple, which is the body (cf 1 Cor. 3:17), so the person who corrupts his soul and intellect by assenting to shameless thoughts and uniting with them is liable to punishment. Just as one should guard the body against visible sins, so one should guard the soul, which is the bride of Christ, against shameless thoughts. 'I betrothed you to Christ, hoping to present you to Him as a pure virgin to her sole husband', writes St Paul (2 Cor. 11:2). 'Guard your heart with all diligence, for on this depends the outcome of-life', says Scripture (Prov. 4:23); and: 'Crooked thoughts separate us from God' (Wisd. 1:3).</p>
      <p> 120.  Let everyone call his own soul to account, examining it and testing it to see to what it is attached; and should he find that his heart does not conform to God's laws, let him try with all his strength to keep not only the body but also the intellect free from corruption and involvement with evil thoughts - if, that is to say, he wishes God in His purity to take up His dwelling within him according to His promise. For God has promised to dwell within souls that are pure and devoted to what is beautiful and good (cf. 2 Cor. 6:16).</p>
      <p> 121.  The prudent farmer first clears his land of brambles before sowing it with seed. Similarly, the man who aspires to receive from God the seed of grace must first clear the earth of his heart, so that when the seed of the Spirit falls it may yield a good and abundant harvest. If he does not first cleanse himself from 'all pollution of the flesh and spirit' (2 Cor. 7:1), he remains flesh and blood and is far from the realm of life (cf. 1 Cor. 15:50).</p>

      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> 122.   One must watch very carefully and in every direction for the enemy's trickery, guile and malice. Speaking through St Paul, the Holy Spirit says: 'I became all things to all men so as to save everyone' (cf. 1 Cor. 9:22); and in the same way the enemy tries to become all things so as to bring everyone to destruction. He pretends to pray with those who pray, so as to cheat them into self-conceit by making them think they have attained the state of prayer. He fasts with those who fast, with the purpose again of filling them with self-conceit because they have succeeded in fasting. With those who understand the Scriptures he tries to do the same, hoping to lead them astray by making them claim to possess spiritual knowledge. To those who have been granted a vision of the light, he pretends to offer the same kind of vision, transforming himself into 'an angel of light' (2 Cor. 11:14), so that through this simulation of the true light he may seduce them to him. In short, he uses every kind of deceit and adapts himself to every kind of appearance, so that by assuming the likeness of what is good he becomes a plausible agent of destruction. 'We destroy evil thoughts and all the self-esteem that exalts itself against the knowledge of God', says St Paul (2 Cor. 10:5). You see to what limits the impostor carries his defiance, wanting to cast down even those who have already attained a divine knowledge of the truth. Hence we must guard the heart with all diligence and beseech God for much understanding, so that He enables us to discern the devil's wiliness, to cultivate and train the intellect in understanding, to attend continually to our thoughts, and to conform ourselves to His will. There is no work greater</p>
      <p> than this. 'Praise and magnificence are His works', as the psalmist writes (Ps. 111:3. LXX).</p>
      <p> 123.  The devout soul, even if it practices all the virtues, ascribes everything to God and nothing to itself. God, on the other hand, when He sees its sound and healthy understanding and knowledge, attributes everything to the soul, and rewards it as though it had achieved everything through its own efforts. He does this in spite of the fact that, if He were to bring us to judgment, no true righteousness would be found in us. For material possessions and everything that man regards as valuable and through which he is able to do good, the earth and whatever is in it, all belong to God. Man's body and soul, and even his very being, are his only by grace. What, then, is left to him that he can call his own, by virtue of which he can pride himself or vindicate himself? Yet when the soul recognizes - what is</p>
      <p> [V3] 340</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> indeed the truth-that all its good actions for God's sake, together with all its understanding and knowledge, are to be ascribed to God alone and that everything should be attributed to Him, then God accepts this as the greatest gift that man can make, as the offering that is most precious in His eyes.</p>
      <p> 124.  When a woman comes to live and share her life with a man, all that each has is held in common. They share one house, a single being and existence. And the woman is mistress not only of the man's possessions but also of his very body: as St Paul says, 'The man does not have power over his own body, but the woman does' (1 Cor. 7:4). Similarly the soul, in its true and ineffable communion with Christ, becomes one spirit with Him (cf 1 Cor. 6:17). It necessarily follows that, since the soul has become His bride, it is as it were mistress of all His untold treasures. For there is no doubt that, when God joins Himself to the soul, all that He has belongs also to the soul, whether it be world, life, death, angels, principalities, things present or things to come (cf. Rom. 8:38).</p>
      <p> 125.  While the Israelites were well pleasing to the Lord-though they were never as they should have been, but at least while they seemed to have some faith in Him-the Lord went before them in a pillar of fire and in a pillar of cloud (cf. Exod. 13:21), He made the sea go back (cf. Exod. 14:21), and conferred on them a thousand other wonders. But when they lost their love for God, then they were handed over to their enemies and were sold into bitter slavery. Something similar happens in the case of the soul. When through grace it has come to know God and has been cleansed of its many past stains, then it is granted gifts of grace; but when it does not ceaselessly maintain befitting love for the celestial bridegroom, it falls away from the life in which it shared; for the enemy can attack even those who have attained a high level of grace. Let us struggle, therefore, as much as we can, and guard our life with fear and trembling. In particular, those who have come to share in the Spirit of Christ should be careful not to grieve the Spirit by acting negligently in any way, great or small. Just as there is joy in heaven over one sinner who repents (cf. Luke 15:7), so there is grief over one soul that falls away from eternal life.</p>
      <p> 126.   When a soul has become worthy of grace, then God will give it spiritual knowledge, understanding and discrimination to the degree that is profitable for it. God will give these things when the</p>

      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> soul asks for them, so that it may be enabled acceptably to serve the Spirit that it has received, and not be seduced by evil, or led into error through ignorance, or perverted by negligence and lack of fear into doing something contrary to His will.</p>
      <p> 127.   The energy of the passions-which is the worldly spirit of delusion, darkness and sin-fills the man in whom it dwells with concern for things of the flesh. The energy and power of the Spirit of light, on the other hand, dwell in the saintly man, as St Paul indicates when he says: 'Do you seek a proof that Christ is speaking through me?' (2 Cor. 13:3); and: '1 no longer live, but Christ lives in me' (Gal. 2:20); and: 'Those of you who have been baptized in Christ have clothed yourselves in Christ' (Gal. 3:27). And Christ affirms the same when He says: '1 and My Father will come and make Our dwelling with him' (cf John 14:23). To those who are found worthy of them these things happen, not unperceived or without manifesting their activity, but with power and trath. The Law with its implacable sentence first brought men to repentance, placing them under an unbearably heavy yoke without being able to hold out the least help. But what the Law cannot offer, the power of the Spirit can provide: 'For what the Law could not do because it was enfeebled through our fleshlmess, God has done', says St Paul (Rom. 8:3). Since Christ's coming the door of grace has been opened to those who truly believe, and they have been given the power of God and the energy of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> 128.  Christ first sent the gift of the natural goodness of the Holy Spirit to His disciples (cf. Acts 2:3). Thereafter the divine power, overshadowing all the faithful and dwelling in their souls, healed the passions of sin and delivered them from darkness and spiritual death. For until then the soul was wounded and captive, held fast in the obscurity of sin. Indeed, even now the soul is still in darkness if Christ has not yet come to dwell in it, and if the power of the Holy Spirit is not active in it, filling it with all strength and assurance. But to those on whom the grace of the divine Spirit has descended, coming to dwell in the deepest levels of their intellect, Christ is as the soul. As St Paul says: 'He who cleaves to the Lord becomes one spirit with Him' (1 Cor. 6:17). And as the Lord Himself says: 'As 1 and Thou are one, so may they be one in Us' (cf. John 17:21). What blessing and goodness has human nature received, abased as it was by the power of evil! But when the soul is entangled in the depravity of the passions, it becomes as though one with it, and even though it possesses its own</p>

      <p> will it cannot do what it wants to do. As St Paul says: 'What I do is not what I want to do' (Rom. 7:15). On the other hand, how much closer is the union it enjoys when one with God's will, when His power is conjoined with it, sanctifying it and making it worthy of Him. For then in truth the soul becomes as the soul of the Lord, submitting willingly and consciously to the power of the Holy Spirit and no longer acting in accordance with its own will. 'What can separate us from the love of Christ' (Rom. 8:35), when the soul is united to the Holy Spirit?</p>
      <p> 129. He who wants to be an imitator of Christ, so that he too may be called a son of God, bom of the Spirit, must above all bear courageously and patiently the afflictions he encounters, whether these be bodily illnesses, slander and vilification from men, or attacks from the unseen spirits. God in His providence allows souls to be tested by various afflictions of this kind, so that it may be revealed which of them truly loves Him. All the patriarchs, prophets, apostles and martyrs from the beginning of time traversed none other than this narrow road of trial and affliction, and it was by doing this that they fulfilled God's will. 'My son,' says Scripture, 'if you come to serve the Lord, prepare your soul for trial, set your heart straight, and patiently endure' (Ecclus. 2:1-2). And elsewhere it is said: 'Accept everything that comes as good, knowing that nothing occurs without God willing it.' Thus the soul that wishes to do God's will must strive above all to acquire patient endurance and hope. For one of the tricks of the devil is to make us listless at times of affliction, so that we give up our hope in the Lord. God never allows a soul that hopes in Him to be so oppressed by trials that it is put to utter confusion. As St Paul writes: 'God is to be trusted not to let us be tried beyond our strength, but with the trial He will provide a way out, so that we are able to bear it' (1 Cor. 10:13). The devil harasses the soul not as much as he wants but as much as God allows him to. Men know what burden may be placed on a mule, what on a donkey, and what on a camel, and load each beast accordingly; and the potter knows how long he must leave the pots in the fire, so that they are not cracked by staying in it too long or rendered useless by being taken out of it before they are properly fired. If human understanding extends this far, must not God be much more aware, infinitely more aware, of the</p>

      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> degree of trial it is right to impose on each sod, so that it becomes tried and true, fit for the kingdom of heaven?</p>
      <p> 130.  Hemp, unless it is well beaten, cannot be worked into fine yam, while the more it is beaten and carded the finer and more serviceable it becomes. And a freshly molded pot that has not been fired is of no use to man. And a child not yet proficient in worldly skills cannot build, plant, sow seed or perform any other worldly task. In a similar manner it often happens through the Lord's goodness that souls, on account of their childlike innocence, participate in divine grace and are filled with the sweetness and repose of the Spirit; but because they have not yet been tested, and have not been tried by the various afflictions of the evil spirits, they are still immature and not yet fit for the kingdom of heaven. As the apostle says: 'If you have not been disciplined you are bastards and not sons' (Heb. 12:8). Thus trials and afflictions are laid upon a man in the way that is best for him, so as to make his soul stronger and more mature; and if the soul endures them to the end with hope in the Lord it cannot fail to attain the promised reward of the Spirit and deliverance from the evil passions.</p>
      <p> 131.  It was by experiencing many torments and enduring even to the point of death that the martyrs earned their crowns of glory; and the greater and more grievous the suffering, the greater their glory and the more intimate their communion with God. In the same way, when our souls are undergoing afflictions-whether they come in a visible form from men, or in an intellectual form by means of evil thoughts, or derive from bodily illnesses-if we endure them to the end, we will gain the same crowns as the martyrs and will enjoy the same intimacy with God. For we will have sustained the martyrdom of afflictions produced by the evil spirits, as the martyrs sustained those that came through men; and the greater the diabolic afflictions we have endured, the greater the glory we receive from God, not only in the future but also in this present life through the grace of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> 132.   Since the road leading to immortal life is extremely narrow and full of affliction, and on account of this there are few who traverse it (cf. Matt. 7:14), we must staunchly endure every trial of the devil, awaiting with hope our heavenly reward. For, however great the afflictions we suffer, what are they compared with the promised future reward, or with the grace of the Holy Spirit that</p>
      <p> [V3] 344</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> visits souls even in this present life, or with the deliverance that we have received from the obscurity of evil passions, or with the enormous debts we owe because of our sins'? As St Paul says: 'The sufferings of this present life are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us' (Rom. 8:18). Hence we must patiently endure everything for the Lord's sake, like brave soldiers dying for our King. Yet why is it that when we gave our attention to the world and to worldly things we did not fall into such distress, but now that we have come to serve God we suffer these manifold trials? It is because the devil, jealous of the blessings stored up for us, tries to make our souls sluggish and lazy, lest by enduring these afflictions for Christ's sake in the way that He wishes we should be granted our reward. No matter how much the devil arms himself against us, if we endure his attacks</p>
      <p> courageously, with Christ's help all his designs against us will be brought to nothing. For we have Jesus as our defender and ally: let us keep in mind that He too passed through this present life vilified, persecuted and reviled, and that finally He was made perfect by a shameful death on the Cross (cf. Heb. 2:10).</p>
      <p> 133.  If we want to endure every affliction and trial readily, let us long to die for Christ and let us keep this death continually before our eyes. For we have been commanded to take up the cross and to follow Him (cf. Matt. 16:24); and this means that we must be prepared and ready for death. If we have this disposition we will endure every affliction, visible and invisible, much more easily. How can he who is anxious to the for Christ's sake have any difficulty in putting up with suffering and distress? Yet we think afflictions are hard to bear, for we do not keep death for Christ's sake before us or rivet our mind always on Christ. But if we want to share His inheritance we must be willing to share His sufferings with an equal zeal. Those who love the Lord may be recognized by the fact that because of their hope in Him they bear every affliction that comes, not simply courageously but also wholeheartedly.</p>
      <p> 134.  If we want to draw close to Christ we must first drag ourselves forcibly towards the good, even though our heart may not wish it. 'The kingdom of heaven is subjected to violence, and the violent take it by force', said the Lord (Matt. 11:12). And He also said: 'Strive to enter through the narrow gate' (Luke 13:24). We must, then, force ourselves even against our will towards virtue, towards love when we lack love, towards gentleness when we have</p>
      <p> [V3]345</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the HomiHes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> need of it, towards sympathy of heart and compassion, towards patience in the face of insult and contempt, and steadfastness in the face of mockery, if we have not yet acquired the habit of these things, and towards prayer if we still have not attained spiritual prayer. If God sees us struggling in this way and forcibly dragging ourselves towards the good even when our heart seems to oppose it. He will bestow true prayer on us, will give us compassion, patience, forbearance, and in general will fill us with all the fruits of the Spirit. Indeed, if a person lacking the other virtues forces himself towards, say, prayer alone, so that he may possess the grace of prayer, but at the same time is not apathetic or indifferent with regard to gentleness, humility, love and all the other virtues that ennoble our soul, including firmness of faith and trust in Christ, then sometimes the Holy Spirit gives him, at least in part, the grace of prayer for which he has asked, and fills him with gladness and repose. But he is still bereft of all the other virtues, because he has not forced himself to acquire them, nor has he besought Christ for them. Moreover, we should force ourselves, even unwillingly, not only towards the virtues mentioned, asking to receive them from God, but also towards the power to judge useless and wholly idle words, unworthy of being spoken; for we should assiduously meditate upon God's words both when we speak and in our heart. And we must also force ourselves not to get angry or to shout-'Rid yourselves of all bitterness, anger and shouting', the apostle says (Eph. 4:31); not to defame or to</p>
      <p> judge anyone, not to become puffed up. When the Lord sees us putting pressure on ourselves and dragging ourselves along forcibly. He will assuredly give us the strength to do painlessly and easily what it was impossible for us to do before, even with force, because of the evil dwelling within us. And then the whole practice of the virtues becomes as it were part of our nature, since henceforward the Lord, as He promised, comes and dwells in us, as we equally dwell in Him; and in Him we fulfill the commandments with great ease.</p>
      <p> 135.  When someone forces himself only towards prayer, while he does not exert or force himself with regard to humility, love, gentleness and all the other interdependent virtues, the result is much as follows. Sometimes in response to his entreaty divine grace visits him, because God in His goodness and love does respond to the petitions of those who call upon Him; but because he has not habituated and trained himself in the practice of the other virtues,</p>
      <p> [V3] 346</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> either he lapses from the grace he has received, falling through self-conceit, or else he does not dedicate himself to this grace and grow in it. The abode and resting-place of the Holy Spirit is humility, love, gentleness and the other holy commandments of Christ. If, therefore, a person desires to grow and to attain perfection by acquiring all these virtues, he must initially force himself to acquire and must establish himself in the first-mat is to say, in prayer-wrestling and striving with his heart to make it receptive and obedient to God. If he first forces himself in this way, completely subduing the resistance of his soul, through good habit making it obedient to him so that it joins with him in his prayer and supplication, then the grace of prayer that he has been given by the Spirit grows and flourishes, reposing upon him together with the humility, love and blessed gentleness which he has also sought to acquire. So, then, the Spirit grants him these virtues as well, teaching him the true humility, genuine love and gentleness that he has previously impelled himself to ask for. Thus he grows and is made perfect in the Lord, and is found worthy of the kingdom of heaven. For the humble man never falls: where, indeed, can he fall to if he regards himself as lower than all things? While lofty-mmdedness leads to great humiliation, humble-mmdedness on the contrary is a great and highly exalted glory.</p>
      <p> 136.  Those who truly love God do not serve Him in order to obtain the kingdom, as though they were engaged in commerce for the sake of gain, nor yet to avoid the punishment that is in store for sinners. They love Him because He is their sole God and Creator, since they know the proper hierarchy of things and that it is the duty of servants to please their lord and maker; and they submit to Him with great understanding in the face of all the afflictions that befall them. Many are the obstacles that stand in the way of pleasing God; for not merely poverty and obscurity but also riches and honor are trials for the soul. Indeed, to some extent even the solace and ease which grace bestows on the soul can easily become a temptation and a hindrance if the soul is not properly conscious of these effects of</p>
      <p> grace and does not enjoy them with great circumspection and understanding: for the spirit of evil tries to persuade the soul to relax now it possesses grace, and so contrives to implant in it sluggishness and apathy. Thus even participation in grace requires caution and discretion on the soul's part, so that the soul shows proper respect for grace and produces fruit worthy of it. There is a danger, then, that</p>
      <p> [V3] 347</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> not only affliction but also relaxation may prove a temptation for the soul, since through both it is tested by the Creator, so as to make it quite clear that it loves Him not for the sake of some gain but for Himself alone, who is truly worthy of love and honor. For the inattentive, who are deficient in faith and immature in mind, there are many obstacles to eternal life - not only distressing and painful things such as sickness, poverty and obscurity, but equally their opposites like riches, honor and praise from others, as well as the unseen warfare of the devil. For those with faith, understanding and courage, on the other hand, such things aid and abet progress towards the kingdom of God: as St Paul says, 'AH things work together for good to them that love God' (Rom. 8:28). The devout man, therefore, breaking through, overcoming and transcending those things regarded by the world as obstacles, cleaves to divine love alone. 'The cords of sinners have entangled me,' writes the psalmist, 'but I have not forgotten Thy law' (Ps. 119:61. LXX).</p>
      <p> 137. St Paul most accurately and lucidly revealed to every believing soul the perfect mystery of the Christian faith, showing to all how to attain experience of it through divine grace. This mystery is the effulgence of celestial light in the vision and power of the Spirit. He did not want anyone to think that the illumination of the Spirit consists simply in enlightening us through conceptual knowledge, and so to risk falling short of the perfect mystery of grace through ignorance and laziness. To indicate the true character of spiritual knowledge St Paul therefore gives as an example the glory of the Holy Spirit that shone from the face of Moses. 'If the ministry of death,' he says, 'engraved in letters on stone, was accompanied by such glory that the sons of Israel could not bear to gaze at the face of Moses because of the glory, transitory though it was, that shone from it, then how much greater must the glory be that accompanies the ministry of the Spirit? If the ministry of condemnation is glorious, the ministry of righteousness must greatly excel it in glory. Indeed, what once seemed full of glory now seems to have no glory at all, because it is outshone by a glory that is so much greater. If what was transitory came with glory, what endures will be far more glorious' (2 Cor. 3:7-11). He says 'transitory' because it was Moses' mortal body that shone with the glory of light. And he continues: 'Having such hope as this, we can proceed with great confidence' (2 Cor. 3:12). A little later he affirms that this everlasting and immortal glory of the Spirit</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the HomiHes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> shines even now with immortal and indestructible power in the immortal inner being of the saints: 'With unveiled face we all'-all, that is to say, who through perfect faith are bom in the Spirit -'reflect as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, and are transfigured into the same image from glory to glory through the Lord who is the Spirit' (2 Cor. 3:18). The words 'with unveiled face' indicate the soul; he adds that when one turns back to the Lord the veil is taken off, and that the Lord is the Spirit (cf 2 Cor. 3:16-17). By this he dearly shows that from the time of Adam's transgression a veil of darkness has encroached upon mankind and has covered the soul. But we believe that through the illumination of the Spirit this veil is now removed from truly faithful and saintly souls. It was for this reason that Christ came; and to those who truly believe in Him God has given the grace to attain this measure of holiness.</p>
      <p> 138.   As we said, the effulgence of the Holy Spirit is not merely some kind of revelation on the level of conceptual images, or merely an illumination of grace. It is the true and unceasing effulgence of God's own light in the soul: 'The God who said, "Out of darkness let light shine", has made His light shine in our hearts, to give us the illumination of the knowledge of Christ's glory' (2 Cor. 4:6). And the psalmist says: 'Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep unto death' (Ps. 13:3) - that is to say, lest when my flesh is dissolved my soul is darkened by the veil of the death that is the result of sin. And other passages in the psalms speak in the same way: 'Open my eyes and I will perceive the wonders of Thy law' (Ps. 119:18); and: 'Send Thy light and Thy truth, and they will guide and lead me to Thy holy mountain and into Thy tabernacles' (Ps. 43:3); and: 'We have been marked by the light of Thy countenance, 0 Lord' (Ps. 4:6. LXX), and so on.</p>
      <p> 139.   Again, the light that illumined St Paul on the road to Damaskos (cf Acts 9:3), the light through which he was raised to the third heaven where he heard unutterable mysteries (cf. 2 Cor. 12:4), was not merely the enlightenment of conceptual images or of spiritual knowledge. It was the effulgence of the power of the Holy Spirit shining in His own person in the soul. Such was its brilliance that corporeal eyes were not able to bear it and were blinded (cf. Acts 9:8); and through it all spiritual knowledge is revealed and God is truly known by the worthy and loving soul.</p>

      <p> in this present life to put on Christ completely in the power and full assurance of grace, and to unite with the heavenly light of the incorruptible image, is initiated here and now substantively into the knowledge of all the heavenly mysteries. Moreover, in the great day of the resurrection the body also will be glorified with the same heavenly image of glory; it will be caught up by the Spirit to the heavens (cf 1 Thess. 4:17), will be given a form like the body of Christ's glory (cf. Phil. 3:21), and with Him will comhent the eternal kingdom.</p>
      <p> 141.  In so far as a man through his own effort and faith has partaken of the heavenly glory of the Holy Spirit, and has beautified his soul with good works, to the same degree will his body, too, be glorified on the day of the resurrection. What he has now stored up inwardly will then manifest itself outwardly, just as the fruit hidden during winter inside the tree comes out when it is spring. The deiform image of the Spirit imprinted even now on the inner being of the saints will make their body, too, outwardly deiform and heavenly. But impure sinners who enwrap the soul in the tenebrous veil of the spirit of this world, and who darken and disfigure the intellect with the ugliness of the passions, will outwardly manifest a body that is also tenebrous and full of every vileness.</p>
      <p> 142.  When God in His love condemned Adam to death after his transgression, he first experienced this death in his soul (cf. Gen. 3:19): his spiritual and deathless organs of perception, deprived of their celestial and spiritual enjoyment, were quenched and became as though dead. Later, after 930 years (cf. Gen. 5:5), came the death of the body. Similarly, now that God has reconciled mankind through the Cross and death of the Savior, He restores to the truly believing soul its enjoyment of spiritual light and mystery while it is still in the flesh, and once more enlightens its spiritual organs of perception with the divine light of grace. Later He will invest the body also with deathless and incorruptible glory.</p>
      <p> 143.   Those who have withdrawn from the world and lead a godly and devout life are still in many cases subject to the veil of the passions to which we all became liable through Adam's transgression: I refer to the carnal will, fittingly called death by St Paul when he said that 'the will of the flesh is death' (Rom. 8:6). Such people may be likened to men walking at night, their way lighted by the stars that are God's holy commandments; but since they have not yet completely escaped from the darkness, they cannot see everything</p>

      <p> clearly. Thus, cultivating virtue with tribulation and great faith, they should beseech Christ, the sun of righteousness, to shine in their hearts, so that they can see everything lucidly. For to those who have reached the heights of virtue, and whose hearts have been actively illumined by spiritual light, the manifold attacks of the demons are clearly evident, as are also the inexpressible vision and the hidden delight and beauty of the incorruptible world. As St Paul says: 'The perfect, whose organs of perception have been trained by practice to discriminate between good and evil.</p>
      <p> take solid food' (Heb. 5:14). And St Peter also says: 'We have the assurance of the message of the prophets; and until the day breaks and the morning star rises in your hearts you do well to give attention to it, for it is like a lamp shining in a dark place' (2 Pet. 1:19). Most people, however, are exactly like men walking at night wholly without light and not enjoying the slightest illumination in their souls from the divine Logos, so that they scarcely differ from the blind. They are totally caught up in material entanglements and the chains of temporal life, neither restrained by divine awe nor performing any virtuous acts. On the other hand, those who live in the world and are illumined by the holy commandments as by the stars, and who do cleave to God with faith and awe, are not utterly shrouded in darkness and for this reason can hope to attain salvation.</p>
      <p> 144.  Worldly riches come to men from different sources and pursuits, from high-ranking office, trade, industry, farming and so on. Something similar is the case where spiritual riches are concerned: some derive them from various gifts of grace, as St Paul makes clear when he says, 'Having then gifts different according to the grace given to us .. .' (Rom. 12:6); and some from various ascetic labors and acts of righteousness and virtue carried out for God alone, when through grace they refrain from judging, mocking or censuring their fellow-men. But some can be likened to people who dig for gold, and they are quite unmistakable: they are those who strive forward with forbearance and patience, gradually enriching the blessed hope that sustains them. Unmistakable, too, are those who are like hirelings, who are stupid and sluggish, who consume at once whatever they can lay hands on, and never patiently bring to conclusion what they have undertaken but are always threadbare and indigent. Even if they are anxious and ready to receive grace, they are lazy, indolent and fickle when it comes to putting it into practice or developing it. They have</p>

      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> no sooner started than they have had enough, and lose all impetus for spiritual labor. For this reason whatever grace they may have received is taken away from them. The dull, slothful, lifeless and negligent disposition, always at variance with grace, barren of good works, worthless and ignoble in the sight of God, is recognizable both now and in the age to come.</p>
      <p> 145.  When man broke God's commandment and was expelled from paradise he was bound in consequence as by two chains. The first is that of temporal things and worldly pleasures-riches, glory, affection, wife, children, relations, country, possessions and, in short, all visible things from which God has summoned us to liberate ourselves through our own free choice. The second is hidden and invisible; for the soul is bound by a certain chain of darkness to the spirits of evil, and because of this darkness it cannot love God, or believe or pray as it wishes. In consequence of the transgression of the first man, we each of us find that all things visible and invisible are opposed to us. Thus, whenever someone listens obediently to the word of God, he must first begin by cutting his attachment</p>
      <p> to temporal things and renouncing all worldly pleasures. Then, if he waits attentively upon God and enters into constant communion with Him, he will receive the power to learn that there is another struggle and another battle of thoughts hidden in the depths of his heart. Persevering in this way and beseeching Christ's mercy, combining great faith in Him with endurance, he can with God's help escape from these inner bonds and fetters and from the darkness of the spirits of evil, which are the energies of the hidden passions. Through Christ's grace and power we can bring this war to a successful conclusion. But by ourselves and without divine aid it is altogether impossible for us to free ourselves from the struggle against evil thoughts: we can merely rebut them and not take pleasure in them.</p>
      <p> 146.  If a man is entangled in the things of this world, caught by their many shackles, and seduced by the evil passions, it is very hard for him to recognize that there is another invisible struggle and another inner warfare. But, after detaching himself from all visible things and worldly pleasures, and beginning to serve God, he then becomes capable of recognizing the nature of this inner struggle and unseen warfare against the passions. Yet, as we said, unless he first achieves outward detachment by aspiring to serve God totally with his whole soul, he will not recognize the secret passions of evil and his</p>

      <p> inner fetters. On the contrary, he will be in danger of thinking that he is healthy and not ailing, when in fact he is lull of wounds and nourishes unseen passions. But if he has despised desire and glory, he may first become aware of these inner passions and then fight against them, calling on Christ with faith and receiving from heaven the weapons of the Spirit: the breastplate of righteousness, the helmet of salvation, the shield of faith, and the sword of the Spirit (cfEph. 6:14,17).</p>
      <p> 147.  The devil tries to disrupt our hope in Christ and our love for Him in a thousand ways. Inwardly he brings afflictions on the soul by means of the evil spirits, or he fills it with foul and immoral thoughts by stirring up its memory of former sins, so as to make it grow sluggish and to despair of ever attaining salvation. His aim is to cheat the soul into thinking that it generates these thoughts of its own accord and that they are not sown in it maliciously by an alien spirit. Or else he inflicts bodily suffering and brings on us vilification and tribulation through the agency of other people. But the more he shoots his fiery arrows at us, the more we must enkindle our hope in God, knowing with certainty that He deliberately permits souls that long for Him to suffer these things, so as to discover if they truly love Him.</p>
      <p> 148.  Compared with the incorruptible and eternal world, a thousand years of this world are like a grain of sand. I look at things in this way. Suppose it is within your power to be sole king of the entire world and to possess all its treasures; and suppose that your rule had begun with the first creation of mankind, and was to continue until the final transformation of the whole visible world. Would you, then, given the choice, exchange the true and unchanging</p>
      <p> kingdom, that contains nothing fleeting or perishable, for this temporal kingdom? Not, it seems to me, if your judgment is sound and you have a proper regard for yourself. 'What good will it do a man if he gains the whole world but loses his soul?' Christ asks His disciples (Matt. 16:26); and He says that there is nothing equal in value to the soul. Since the soul by itself is far more valuable than the whole world and any worldly kingdom, is not the kingdom of heaven also more valuable? That the soul is more valuable is shown by the fact that God did not see fit to bestow on any other created thing the union and fellowship with His own coessential Spirit. Not sky, sun, moon, stars, sea, earth or any other visible thing did He bless in this way, but man alone, whom of</p>
      <p> [V3]353</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> VI The Freedom of the Intellect</p>
      <p> all His creatures He especially loved. If, therefore, no one with sound judgment would exchange the eternal kingdom for all the great wealth of the world and for the kingdom of the whole earth, how great is the folly of those who exchange it for accidental and casual things such as desire for something, meager glory, mediocre gain, and so on? For whenever we love something worldly and are attached to it, we are certainly choosing it instead of the kingdom of heaven. Worst of all, we regard this thing as God: as it has been said, 'A man is the slave to whatever has mastered him' (2 Pet. 2:19). We should, therefore, commit ourselves entirely to God, making ourselves dependent on Him and crucifying ourselves in soul and body as we advance in the practice of all His holy commandments.</p>
      <p> 149.  Would you think it right if this perishable glory, ephemeral kingdom and other such temporal things were gained only after great toil and sweat by those who hanker after them, while to reign endlessly with Christ and to enjoy inexpressible blessings was something to be gained cheaply and easily, and could be attained without labor and effort by anyone who wished?</p>
      <p> 150.  What is the purpose of Christ's advent? The restoration and reintegration of human nature in Him. For He restored to human nature the original dignity of Adam, and in addition bestowed on it the unutterable grace of the heavenly inheritance of the Holy Spirit. Leading it out of the prison of darkness. He showed it the way and the door to life. By traversing this way and knocking on this door we can enter the kingdom of heaven. As He said: 'Ask and it will be given to you... knock and it will be opened to you' (Matt. 7:7). By passing through this door it is possible for everyone to attain the freedom of his soul, to cut off his evil thoughts, and to become Christ's bride and consort through the communion of the Holy Spirit. Such is the ineffable love of the Lord towards man, whom he has created in His own image.</p>
