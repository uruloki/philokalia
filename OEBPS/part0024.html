      <p> 76.  According to St Maximos, 'Moses and David, and whoever else became vessels of divine energy by laying aside the properties of then-fallen nature, were inspired by the power of God'; and. 'They became living icons of Christ, being the same as He is, by grace rather than by assimilation.' He farther says. The purity in Christ and in the saints is one.' As the divine Psalmist chants, 'May the splendor of our God be upon us' (Ps. 90:17. LXX). For according to St Basil, 'Spirit-bearing souls, when illumined by the Spirit, both become spiritual themselves and shed forth grace upon others. From this comes foreknowledge of things future, understanding of mysteries, apprehension of things hidden, distribution of spiritual gifts, citizenship in heaven, the dance with the angels, unending joy, divine largesse, likeness to God, and the desire of all desires, to become God.'</p>
      <p> 77.   The angels excel men with respect to this grace, resplendence, and union with God. On this account they are secondary luminaries, ministers of the supreme resplendence. The noetic powers and ministering spirits are secondary lights and irradiations of the primal Light.' The angels are 'the first luminous nature after the Primal Being, because they shine forth from It'. 'An angel is a secondary light, an emanation or a communication of the Primal Light.' The divine intellects move in a circular fashion, uniting themselves with the unonginate and unending illuminations of the Beautiful and Good', for 'God Himself and naught else is light for eternal beings'. 'What the sun is for sensory beings. God is for noetic beings. He is the primal and supreme light illumining all intelligent nature.' As St John Chrysostom says, when you hear the prophet saying, '1 saw the Lord sitting upon a throne' (Isa. 6:1), understand that he saw not God's essence but His gift of Himself, and this even more obscurely than the supreme powers behold it.</p>

      <p> 78. Every created nature is far removed from and completely foreign to the divine nature. For if God is nature, other things are not nature; but if every other thing is nature. He is not a nature, just as He is not a being if all other things are beings. And if He is a being, then all other things are not beings. And if you accept this as true also for wisdom, goodness, and in general all. things that pertain to God or are ascribed to Him, then your theology will be correct and in accordance with the saints. God both is and is said to be the nature of all beings, in so far as all partake of Him and subsist by means of this participation: not, however, by participation in His nature - far from it -but by participation in His energy. In this sense He is the Being of all beings, the Form that is in all forms as the Author of form, the Wisdom of the wise and, simply, the All of all things. Moreover, He is not nature, because He transcends every nature; He is not a being, because He transcends every being; and He is not nor does He possess a form, because He transcends form. How, then, can we draw near to God? By drawing near to His nature? But not a</p>
      <p> single created being has or can have any communication with or proximity to the sublime nature. Thus if anyone has drawn close to God, he has evidently approached Him by means of His energy. In what way? By natural participation in that energy? But this is common to all created things. It is not, therefore, by virtue of natural qualities, but by virtue of what one achieves through free choice that one is close to or distant from God. But free choice pertains only to beings endowed with intelligence. So among all creatures only those endowed with intelligence can be far from or close to God, drawing close to Him through virtue or becoming distant through vice. Thus such beings alone are capable of wretchedness or blessedness. Let us strive to lay hold of blessedness.</p>
      <p> 79. When created beings are compared among themselves, some are said to be naturally akin to God and others alien. The noetic natures that are apprehended by the intellect alone are, so it is claimed, akin to the Divinity, whereas all natures subject to sense-perception are in every way alien to It; and those among them that are utterly bereft of soul and unmoving are the most remote of all. Thus, when compared among themselves, created beings are said to be naturally either akin or alien to God. Properly speaking, however, all of them in themselves are alien to Him by nature. Indeed, it is no more possible to say how distant noetic nature is from God than how remote sense-perception and the things of the realm of the senses are from noetic</p>

      <p> beings. If we are, then, by nature so far removed from God, alas for us if we do not draw close to Him by freely choosing to act well and to conduct ourselves with probity.</p>
      <p> 80.   The inspired and universal tongue of the divine theologians, St John of Damaskos, says in the second of his theological chapters: 'A man who would speak or hear anything about God should know with all clarity that in what concerns theology and the divine economy not all things are inexpressible and not all are capable of expression, and neither are all things unknowable nor are they all knowable.' We know that those divine realities of which we desire to speak transcend speech, since such realities exist according to a principle that is transcendent. They are not outside the realm of speech by reason of some deficiency, but are beyond the conceptual power innate within us and to which we give utterance when speaking to others. For neither can our speech explain these realities by interpretation, nor does our innate conceptual power have the capacity to attain them of its own accord through investigation. Thus we should not permit ourselves to say anything concerning God, but rather we should have recourse to those who in the Spirit speak of the things of the Spirit, and this is the case even when our adversaries require some statement from us.</p>
      <p> 81.  It is said that on the portals of Plato's academy were inscribed the words, 'Let no man enter who is ignorant of geometry.' A person incapable of conceiving and discoursing about inseparable things as separate is in every respect ignorant of geometry. For there cannot be a limit without something limited. But geometry is almost entirely a science of limits, and it even defines and extends limits on their own account, abstracted from that which they limit, because the intellect separates the inseparable. How, then, can a person who has never learnt to separate in his</p>
      <p> intellect a physical object from its attributes be able to conceive of nature in itselt7 For nature is not merely inseparable from the natural elements in which it inheres, but it cannot even exist at any time without them. How can he conceive of universals as universals, since they exist as such in particulars and are distinguished from them only by the intelligence and reason, being perceived intellectually as prior to the many particulars although in truth they can in no way exist apart from these many particulars? How shall he</p>
      <p> [V4] 384</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> apprehend intellectual and noetic things? How shall he understand us when we say that each intellect also has thought and that each of our thoughts is our intellect? How shall he not ridicule us and accuse us of saying that each man possesses two or many minds?</p>
      <p> If, then, someone is unable to speak or conceive of things indivisible as distinct, how will he be able to discuss or be taught anything of this sort concerning God, with respect to whom, according to the theologians, there are and are said to be many unions and distinctions? But although the unions pertaining to God prevail over and are prior to the distinctions, they do not abolish them nor are they at all impeded by them. The followers of Akindynos, however, cannot accept nor can they understand the indivisible distinction that exists in God, even when they hear us speaking - in harmony with the saints - of a divided union. For to God pertains both incomprehensibility and comprehensibility, though He Himself is one. The same God is incomprehensible in His essence, but comprehensible from what He creates according to His divine energies: according, that is, to His pre-etemal will for us. His pre-etemal providence concerning us. His pre-etemal wisdom with regard to us, and - to use the words of St Maximos - His infinite power, wisdom and goodness. But when Barlaam and Akindynos and those who follow in their footsteps hear us saying these things which we are obliged to say, they accuse us of speaking of many gods and many uncreated realities, and of making God composite. For they are ignorant of the fact that God is indivisibly divided and is united dividedly, and yet in spite of this suffers neither multiplicity nor compositeness.</p>
      <p> 82. St Paul, the mouth of Christ, the chosen vessel, the glorious chariot of the divine name, says, 'From the creation of the world the invisible realities of God, namely. His eternal power and divinity, may be perceived in created things by means of intellection' (Rom. 1:20). May, then, the essence of God be perceived in created things by means of intellection? Certainly not. This is the madness of Barlaam and Akindynos and, before them, the delusion of Eunomios. For, prior to them but in the same manner, Eunomios in his discourses wrote that from created things we may comprehend nothing less than God's</p>
      <p> [V4] 385</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> essence itself. St Paul, however, is very far from teaching any such thing. For having just stated, 'What can be known of God is manifest' (Rom. 1:19), and having thus indicated that there exists something else beyond that which can be known about God and which He Himself has made manifest to all men of intelligence, he then adds: 'For from the creation of the world the invisible realities of God may be perceived in created things by means of intellection.' You may in this way learn what it is that is knowable about God. The holy fathers explain that what is unknowable in God is His essence, while what may be known is that which pertains to His essence, namely, goodness, wisdom, power, divinity and majesty. These St Paul also calls invisible, though they are perceived in created things by means of intellection. But how could these things, which pertain to God's essence and may be perceived in things created, be themselves created? Therefore the divine energy, mtellected through created things, is both uncreated and yet not the essence. For the divine energy is referred to not only in the singular but also in the plural.</p>
      <p> 83.  In refuting Eunomios, who claimed that the essence of God is revealed by created things, St Basil the Great writes that 'created things manifest wisdom, art and power, but not essence'. Thus the divine energy made manifest by created things is both uncreated and yet not God's essence; and those who like Barlaam and Akindynos say that there is no difference between the divine essence and the divine energy are clearly Eunomians.</p>
      <p> 84.  Most excellently does St Gregory of Nyssa, St Basil's bodily and spiritual brother, say in his refutation of Eunomios: 'When we perceive the beauty and grandeur of the wonders of creation, and from these and similar things derive other intellections concerning the Divinity, we interpret each of the intellections produced in us by its own distinctive name. "For from the grandeur and beauty of created things the Creator is contemplated by way of analogy" (Wisd. 13:5). We also call the Creator the Demiurge; Powerful, in that His power is sufficient to make His will reality; and Just, as the impartial judge. Likewise the term God  (Theos)  we have taken from His providential and overseeing activity. In this manner, then, by the term God we have been taught about a certain partial activity of the divine nature, but we</p>
      <p> [V4] 386</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> have not attained an understanding of God's essence by means of this word.'</p>
      <p> 85. St Dionysios the Areopagite, the most eminent theologian after the divine apostles, having clarified the distinction of the hypostases in God, says: 'The beneficent procession is a divine distinction, for the divine unity in a transcendently united manner multiplies and makes itself manifold through goodness.' And a little further on he says: 'We call divine distinction the beneficial processions of the Thearchy. For m bestowing itself upon all beings and abundantly pouring forth participation in all good things, it is distinguished in its unity, multiplied in its</p>
      <p> oneness, and made manifold without ceasing to be one ' Later he writes: 'These common and united distinctions - or, rather, these beneficent processions - of the whole Godhead we will try to praise to the best of our ability.'</p>
      <p> Thus St Dionysios shows clearly that there is also another distinction in God besides the distinction of the hypostases, and this distinction that is different from that of the hypostases he calls the distinction of the Godhead. For, indeed, the distinction of the hypostases is not a distinction pertaining to the Godhead. And he says that according to the divine processions and energies God multiplies Himself and makes Himself manifold, and he states in this respect that the procession may be spoken of both in the singular and in the plural. In regard to the distinction of the hypostases, however, the Deity certainly does not multiply Himself, nor as God is He subject to distinction. For us God is a Trinity, but not triple. St Dionysios also affirms that these processions and energies are uncreated, since he calls them divine and says that they are distinctions pertaining to the whole Godhead. He likewise says that the very Thearchy itself multiplies and makes Itself manifold according to these divine processions and energies, though not certainly by assuming anything external. Furthermore, this most sublime of the divine hymnologists promises to celebrate these processions; but he adds, 'to the best of our ability', in order to show that they transcend all celebration.</p>
      <p> 86. Having said that the beneficent procession is a divine</p>
      <p> [V4] 387</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> distinction, this same revealer of things divine adds: 'Yet the unconditioned communications are united with respect to the divine distinction.' Here he groups together all the processions and energies of God and calls them communications. He says further that they are unconditioned, lest anyone should suppose that these communications are created effects such as the individual essence of each thing that exists, or the physical life of animals, or the reason and intellect inherent in rational and noetic beings. For how could these things be unconditioned in God and at the same time be created? And how could God's unconditioned processions and communications be created things, since the unconditioned communication is naturally inherent in the communicator, as we see in the case of light?</p>
      <p> 87. St Dionysios now goes on to celebrate these processions and energies with other godlike names, calling them participable principles and essential participable principles. In many places in his writings he shows them to be superior to existent things, and that they are the paradigms or exemplars of existent things, pre-existing in God by means of a supra-essential union. How, then, could they be created? He then tells us what these paradigms are, saying: 'We call paradigms the essence-forming  logoi  or inner principles of existent things; they unitedly pre-exist in God, and theology refers to them as the predeterminations and divine and sacred volitions that determine and create existent things. It is in accordance with them that the Supra-essential both predetermines and brings forth everything that is.' How could me predeterminations and the divine volitions that create all existent things be themselves created? Is it not clear that those who maintain that these processions and energies are created degrade God's providence to the level of something created? For the energy that creates individual essence, life and wisdom, and in</p>
      <p> general makes and sustains created beings, is identical with me divine volitions and the divine participable principles and the gifts of supernal Goodness, the Cause of all.</p>
      <p> 88. The participable principle of absolute Being in no way participates in anything, as the great Dionysios also says. But the other participable principles, in that they are participable principles of existent things, also participate in nothing else whatsoever, for</p>
      <p> [V4] 388</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> providence does not participate in providence, nor life in life. But in that they possess being they are said to participate in absolute Being, since without this they can neither exist nor be participated in, just as there can be no foreknowledge without knowledge. Thus, as essential participable principles, they are in no way created. Hence, according to St Maximos, they never began to be and they are seen to pertain to God in an essential manner, and there was never a time when they were not. But when the followers of Barlaam impiously suppose that because life itself, goodness itself and so forth, share in the common denomination of existent things they are therefore created, they do not comprehend that although they are called existent things, they are also superior to existent things, as St Dionysios says. Those who for this reason place the essential participable principles among created things could easily regard the Holy Spirit as created, whereas St Basil the Great says that the Spirit shares in names befitting the Divinity.</p>
      <p> 89.   Should someone claim that only absolute Being is a participable principle since it alone does not participate in anything but is solely participated in, whilst the other participable principles participate in it, he should know that he does not think aright with regard to the other participable principles. For living things or holy things or good things are said to live and to become holy and good by participation, not simply because they exist and participate in absolute Being, but because they partake of absolute life, holiness and goodness. But absolute life - and the same applies to other such realities - does not become absolute life by participation in some other absolute life. As absolute life, it is among those realities that are participated in, not among those that participate. How could that which does not participate in life, but is itself participated in by living things and quickens them, be something created? And one may say the same with regard to the other participable principles.</p>
      <p> 90.  Let St Maximos now lend us his support. He writes in his  Scholia  that the providence creating existent things is identical with the processions of God. He says: 'The creative providences and good-nesses' - those that bestow individual essence, life and wisdom - 'are</p>
      <p> [V4] 389</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> common to the tn-hypostatic differentiated Unity ' By stating that these providences and goodnesses are many and distinct, he shows that they are not the essence of God, since that is one and ahogether indivisible. But because they are common to the tri-hypostatic differentiated Unity, he shows us that they are not identical with the Son or the Holy Spirit, for neither the Son nor the Holy Spirit is an energy common to the three hypostases. Yet by stating that they are not only providences and goodnesses but are also creative, he shows them to be uncreated. For if this were not the case, then the creative power would itself be created by another creative power, and that in turn by another, and so on to the uttermost absurdity, not even stopping at infinity. Thus God's processions and energies are uncreated, and none of them is either divine essence or hypostasis.</p>
      <p> 91. In the incomparable superabundance of His goodness He who brought forth and adorned the universe established it as multiform. He willed that some things should simply possess being, while others should possess life in addition to being. Of these latter He willed that some should possess noetic life, that others should enjoy merely a sensible life, while others again should possess a life mingled of both. When this last category of beings had received from Him rational and noetic life. He willed that by the free inclination of their will towards Him they should achieve union with Him and thus live in a divine and supernatural manner, having been vouchsafed His deifying grace and energy. For His will is generation for things that exist, whether for those brought forth out of non-being, or for those being brought to a better state; and this takes place in diverse ways. Because of the diversity of the divine will with respect to existent things, the one providence and goodness of God - or, in other words. God's turning towards inferior beings by reason of His goodness - both is, and is thus called by the divinely wise theologians, many providences and goodnesses, for they are indivisibly divided and differentiated among divisible things. Thus one is called God's power of foreknowledge, and another His creative and sustaining power. Further, according to the great Dionysios, some bestow individual essence, some life, and some wisdom. Now each of these powers is common to Father, Son and</p>
      <p> [V4] 390</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> Holy Spirit, and in each good and divine volition with respect to us it is Father, Son and Holy Spirit that are its essence-bestowing, life-bestowing and wisdom-bestowing energy and power. These St Dionysios calls unconditioned and undiminishable communications, elevating them above all created things and teaching us that they inhere by nature in Him who communicates them.</p>
      <p> 92. Just as the sun without diminution communicates heat and light to those who participate in them, and itself possesses these qualities as its inherent and essential energies, so the divine communications, since they inhere without diminution in Him who bestows communion, are His natural and essential energies. Thus they are also uncreated. When the sun sets beneath the horizon and is no longer visible, not even a trace of its light remains; yet when it is visible, the eye that receives its light cannot but be mingled with it and united by it to the wellspring of</p>
      <p> light. The sun's warmth, however, and its effects which contribute to the generation and growth of sensible things, and to the manifold diversity of humors and qualities, do hot desert these creatures, even when there is no contact with the sun through the sun's rays. In the same manner as indicated in this inadequate image taken from sensible reality, only those who aspire after the supernal and most divine light participate integrally in deifying grace and by it are united to God. All other beings are effects of the creative energy, brought forth from nothing by grace as a free gift but not illumined by grace, which is the same as God's resplendence.</p>
      <p> 93. This resplendence and deifying energy of God, that deifies those who participate in it, constitutes divine grace, but it is not the nature of God. This does not mean that God's nature is distant from those who have received grace -and this is Akmdynos' ridiculous slander - for God's nature is everywhere; but it means that it is not participable, since no created thing, as we have already shown, is capable of participating in it. The divine energy and grace of the Spirit, being everywhere present and remaining inseparable from the Spirit, is imparticipable, as though absent, for those who on account of their impurity are unfit to participate in it. Just as faces, so it is said, are not reflected by every material, but only by such materials as possess smoothness and transparency, so the energy of the Spirit is not found in all souls, but only in those possessing no perversity or deviousness. Again, it is said that the Holy Spirit is present to all, but He manifests His power only in those who are purified from the passions, and does</p>
      <p> [V4] 391</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> not manifest it in those whose intellect is still confused by the defilement of sin.</p>
      <p> 94.  The light of the sun is inseparable from the sun's rays and from the heat which they dispense; yet for those who receive the rays but have no eyes the light is imparticipable and they sense only the heat coming from the rays. For those bereft of eyes cannot possibly perceive light. In the same way, but to a greater extent, no one who enjoys the divine radiance can participate in the essence of the Creator. For there is absolutely no creature that possesses the capacity to perceive the Creator's nature.</p>
      <p> 95.  Here let St John, the Baptist of Christ, as well as St John who was more beloved by Christ than the other disciples, and St John Chrysostom, now bear witness with us that the participated divine energy is neither created nor the essence of God. St John the Evangelist does so by what he writes in his Gospel, the Forerunner and Baptist of Christ when he says: 'It is not by measure that the Spirit is given to Christ by God the Father' (cf. John 3:34). St John Chrysostom explains this passage when he states: 'Here "Spirit" means the energy of the Spirit. For all of us receive the energy of the Spirit by measure, but Christ possesses the Spirit's entire energy in full and without measure. But if His energy is without measure, how much more so is His essence.' By calling the energy 'Spirit' - or, rather, the very Spirit of God - as the Baptist did, and by saying that the energy is without measure, Chrysostom showed its uncreated character. Again, by saying that we receive it by measure he indicated the difference between the uncreated energy and the uncreated essence of God. For no one ever receives the essence of God, not even if all men are taken collectively, each one receiving in part according to his degree of purity. Chrysostom then goes on to reveal another difference between the uncreated essence and the uncreated energy, for he says, 'If the energy of the</p>
      <p> Spirit is without measure, how much more so is His essence '</p>
      <p> 96. If, according to the absurdities of Akmdynos and those who share his views, the divine energy does not m any respect differ from the divine essence, then the act of creating, which is something that pertains to the energy, will not in any respect differ from the act of</p>
      <p> [V4] 392</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> begetting and the act of procession, -which are things that pertain to the essence. But if the act of creating is not distinct from that of begetting and of procession, then created things will in no way differ from Him who is begotten and Him who is sent forth. But if this is the case - as according to these men it is - then both the Son of God and the Holy Spirit will in no way differ from creatures: all created things will be begotten and sent forth by God the Father, creation will be deified, and God will share His rank with creatures. For this reason St Cyril, affirming the distinction between God's essence and energy, says, 'The act of generation pertains to the divine nature, whereas the act of creating pertains to His divine energy.' Then he clearly underscores what he has affirmed by saying, 'Nature and energy are not identical.'</p>
      <p> 97.   If the divine essence does not in any respect differ from the divine energy, then the act of generation and of procession will in no respect differ from the act of creating. But God the Father creates through the Son in the Holy Spirit. Thus, in the view of Akmdynos and his adherents. He also begets and sends forth through the Son in the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> 98.  If the divine essence does not in any respect differ from the divine energy, then neither does it differ from the divine will. Thus the Son, who alone is begotten from the Father's essence, is according to these people also created from the Father's will.</p>
      <p> 99.  If the divine essence does not in any respect differ from the divine energy, and if the holy fathers testify that God has many energies - for, as shown above. He has creative providences and goodnesses - then God also has many essences. This is a view that no member of the Christian race has ever uttered or entertained.</p>
      <p> 100.  If the energies of God do not in any respect differ from the divine essence, then neither will they differ from one another. Therefore God's will is in no way different from His foreknowledge, and consequently either God does not foreknow all things - because He does not will all that occurs - or else He wills evil also, since He foreknows all. This means either that He does not foreknow all things, which is the same as saying that He is not God, or that He is not good, which is also the same as saying that He is not God. Thus God's</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> foreknowledge does differ from His will, and so both differ from the divine essence.</p>
      <p> 101.  If the divine energies do not differ from one another, then God's creative power is not distinct from His foreknowledge. But in that case, since God began to create at a particular moment. He also began to foreknow at a particular moment. Yet if God did not have foreknowledge of all things before the ages how could He be God?</p>
      <p> 102.  If God's creative energy does not differ in any respect from divine foreknowledge, then created things are concurrent with God's foreknowledge. Thus because God unongmately has foreknowledge and what is foreknown is unoriginately foreknown, it follows that God creates unoriginately, and therefore that created things will have been created unoriginately. But how shall He be God if His creatures are in no way subsequent to Him?</p>
      <p> 103.  If God's creative energy in no respect differs from His foreknowledge, then the act of creating is not subject to His will, since His foreknowledge is not so subject. In that case God will create, not by an act of volition, but simply because it is His nature to create. But how will He be God if He creates without volition?</p>
      <p> 104.  God Himself is within Himself, since the three divine hypostases co-naturally and eternally cleave to one another and unconfusedly interpenetrate each other. Yet God is also in the universe and the universe is within God, the one sustaining, the other being sustained by Him. Thus all things participate in God's sustaining energy, but not in His essence. Hence the theologians say that divine omnipresence also constitutes an energy of God.</p>
      <p> 105.   If we have conformed ourselves to God and have attained that for which we are created, namely, deification -for they say that God created us in order to make us partakers of His own divinity (cf 2 Pet. 1:4) - then we are in God since we are deified by Him, and God is in us since it is He who deifies us. Thus we, too, participate in the divine energy - though in a different way from the universe as a whole - but not in the essence of God. Hence the theologians say that 'divinity" is also an appellation of the divine energy.</p>
      <p> 106.   The supra-essential, supra-existential nature that transcends the Godhead and goodness, in that it is more than God and more than goodness, and so on, can be neither described nor conceived nor in any way contemplated, since it transcends all thmgs and is surpassingly unknowable, being established by uncircumscribed power beyond the</p>

      <p> supracelestial intelligences, and always utterly ungraspable and ineffable for all. Neither in the present age nor in the age to come is there any name with which it can be named, nor can the soul form any concept of it or any word express it; and there can be no contact with or participation in it, whether sensible or noetic, nor any imagining of it at  all.   Thus the theologians hold that the closest idea we  can have  of this nature  is that of its perfect</p>
      <p> incomprehensibility attained by means of negation, or apophasis, since this nature is transcendentally privative of all that exists or can be expressed. Hence he who possesses knowledge of the truth beyond all truth, if he is to name it correctly, cannot legitimately call it either essence or nature. Yet it is the cause of all things and all things pertain to it and exist on its account; and it is prior to all things and in a simple and undetermined manner it precontains all things in itself. Thus it can be named loosely and inexactly from all things. Accordingly it can be called both essence and nature, though property speaking we should name it the creative procession and energy whereby God creates individual essences; for the great Dionysios says that this is 'the proper theological name for the essence of Him who truly is'.</p>
      <p> 107. One can find the term 'nature' applied also to natural attributes, both in the case of created beings and in the case of God. Thus St Gregory of Nazianzos says somewhere in his poems, 'It is the nature of my King to bestow blessedness.' Now bestowing is not the nature of anything; it is, rather, the natural attribute of one who is beneficent. Similarly, with regard to fire one can say that its nature is to ascend upwards and to cast light upon those who behold it. Yet the motion in itself is not the nature of fire, nor is the production of light; rather its nature is the origin of the motion. Hence natural attributes are also called nature. This is confirmed by the great Dionysios when he says somewhere, 'It is the nature of the Good to bring forth and to save,' meaning that these acts are attributes of the divine nature. Thus when you hear the fathers saying that God's essence is imparticipable, you should realize that they refer to the essence that does not depart from itself and is unmanifest. Again, when they say that it is participable, you should realize that they refer to the procession, manifestation and energy that are God's natural attributes.</p>

      <p> When you accept both statements in this sense you will be in agreement with the fathers.</p>
      <p> 108. Even the smallest portion of an essence possesses all that essence's powers. Thus a spark is both brilliant and illuminating, it melts and bums whatever comes close to it, it is self-moving by nature and rises upwards and, in brief, it is whatever fire is, of which it is a part. Similarly a drop of water possesses every quality that water has, of which it is a drop; and a nugget possesses whatever quality is possessed by the metal of which it is a fragment. Thus if we participate in the unmanifest essence of God, then, whether we participate in the whole of it or a part of it, we would be all-powerful, and in the same way each existent being would be all-powerful. But all-powerfulness is not a quality that even all mankind or all creation collectively possesses. St Paul shows this with abundant clarity when referring to those who share in the deiiying gifts of the Spirit; for he testifies that not all the gifts of the Spirit belong to each individual. 'To one', he says, 'is given the quality of wisdom, to another the quality of knowledge, to another some other gift of the same Spirit' (cf 1 Cor. 12:8). And St John Chrysostom clearly thwarts in advance the error of Barlaam and Akmdynos when he says, 'A man does not possess all the gifts, lest he think that grace is nature.' Yet no intelligent person would suppose that grace, here distinguished from the divine nature, is created, for obviously no one would be in any danger of supposing a created thing to be the nature of God. Moreover, the grace of the</p>
      <p> Spirit, though differing from the divine nature, is not separated from it; rather, it draws those privileged to receive it towards union with the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> 109. An essence has as many hypostases as there are partakers of it. We make as many hypostases of fire as the number of lamps we light from a single lamp. Yet if, as our opponents assert. God's essence is participated in, and is even participated in by everyone, this means that His essence is not tn-hypostatic, but multi-hypostatic. Who trained in the divine doctrine will not recognize this as the absurdity of the Messalians? For the Messalians maintain that those who have</p>
      <p> [V4] 396</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> attained the height of virtue participate in the essence of God. Yet the followers of Akindynos in their zeal to surpass this blasphemy say that not only do certain people distinguished in virtue participate in the divine essence, but all beings in general participate in it; and they say this on the spurious pretext that the divine essence is everywhere present. But St Gregory of Nazianzos, eminent in theology, long ago refuted the dotty views of both the Messalians and the Akindymsts when he said, 'He is "Christ", the Anointed, on account of His divinity; for it is the divinity that anoints His human nature. This anointing sanctifies the human nature not merely with an energy, as is the case with all others who are anointed, but with the presence of the whole of Him who anoints.' With one voice the holy fathers have declared that the divinity dwells in those who are fittingly purified, but not as regards its nature. Thus a person does not participate in God either according to His essence or according to His hypostases, for neither of these can be in any way divided, nor can they be communicated to any one at all. Hence God is in this respect totally inaccessible to all, though indeed He is also everywhere present. But the energy and power common to the tri-hypostatic nature is variously and proportionately divided among those who participate in it, and is therefore accessible to those who are blessed with it. For, as St Basil says, 'the Holy Spirit is not participated in to the same degree by each person who receives Him; rather. He distributes His energy according to the faith of the participant; for though He is simple in essence. He is diverse in His powers.'</p>
      <p> 110. That which is said to participate in something possesses a part of that in which it participates; for if it participates not in a part only but in the whole, then strictly speaking it does, not participate in but possesses that whole. Hence, if the participant must necessarily participate in a part, what is participated in is divisible. But the essence of God is in every way indivisible, and therefore it is altogether unparticipable. On the other hand, the property of the divine energy is to be divisible, as the holy father St John Chrysostom frequently affirms. Hence it is the divine energy that is participated in by those who have been privileged to receive deifying grace. Listen, then, once</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> more to St John Chrysostom, as he clearly elucidates both these points, namely, that it is the energy that is indivisibly divided and also participated in, and not the imparticipable essence from which the divine energy proceeds. Citing the gospel words, 'Of His fullness we have all received' (John 1: 16), he says, 'If in the case of fire, where what is divided is both essence and body, we both divide it and do not divide it, how much more so is this the case with respect to the energy, especially the energy of the unembodied essence?'</p>
      <p> 111.  Further, that which participates in something according to its essence must necessarily possess a common essence with that in which it participates and be identical to it in some respect. But who has ever heard that God and we possess in some respect the same essence? St Basil the Great says, 'The energies of God come down to us, but the essence remains inaccessible.' And St Maximos also says, 'He who is deified through grace will be everything that God is, without possessing identity of essence.' Thus it is impossible to participate in God's essence, even for those who are deified by divme grace. It is, however, possible to participate in the divine energy. To this does the measured light of truth here below lead me, to behold and experience the splendor of God,' states St Gregory of Nazianzos. As the Psalmist says, 'May the splendor of our God be upon us' (Ps. 90:17. LXX). There is a single energy of God and the saints,' St Maximos clearly writes, who was one of their number; they are 'living icons of Christ, being the same as He is, by grace rather than by assimilation.'</p>
      <p> 112.  God is identical within Himself, since the three divine hypostases mutually coinhere and interpenetrate naturally, totally, eternally, mseparably, and yet without mingling or confusion, so that their energy is also one. This could never be the case among creatures. There are similarities among creatures of the same genus, but since each independent existence, or hypostasis, operates by itself, its energy is uniquely its own. The situation is different with the three divine hypostases that we worship, for there the energy is truly one and the</p>
      <p> [V4] 398</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> same. For the activity of the divine will is one, originating from the Father, the primal Cause, issuing through the Son, and made manifest in the Holy Spirit This is clear from the created effects, for it is from the effects that we know every natural energy. Although they are similar, different nests are made by different swallows, and different pages are written by different scribes, though the materials used are the same. But with the Father, Son and Holy Spirit it is not the case that each one of the hypostases has His own particular effect. Rather, all creation is the smgle work of the three. Thus we have been initiated by the fathers to recognize from creation that the divine energy of the three Persons whom we worship is one and the same, and that they do not each possess an individual energy which merely resembles that of the other two.</p>
      <p> 113.  Since Father, Son and Holy Spirit unconfusedly and unmix-edly interpenetrate one another, we know that they possess an activity and energy that is strictly one and unique. The life or power mat the Father possesses in Himself is not different from that in the Son, since the Son possesses the same life and power as the Father; and the same can be said of the Son and me Holy Spirit. As for those who think that the divine energy does not differ from the divine essence because our life is nothing else but God Himself, and He Himself is pre-etemal life not in relation to something else but in Himself, they are both ignorant and heretics. They are ignorant because they have not yet learnt that the supreme Trinity is none other than God Himself, and that the supreme Unity is none other than God Himself, though this in no way prevents the Unity from being distinguished from the Trinity. They are heretics because they abolish both essence and energy, the one through the other. For what is dependent on another is not essence; and what is self-subsistent is not dependent on another. Thus if the essence and the energy in no way differ from each other, they abolish each other, or, rather, 1 should say that they expel from the number of the godfearing those who say that there is no difference between them.</p>
      <p> 114.  We, on the contrary, confess that the Son of God is our life as regards cause and energy, and that He is also life in Himself absolutely and mdependently of all; and we declare mat He possesses both these attributes uncreatedly. We likewise confess the same thing with reference to the Father and the Holy Spirit. Thus this life of ours, that as the cause of living things quickens us, is none other than Father, Son and Holy Spirit. For our tri-hypostatic God is said to be our life as</p>
      <p> [V4] 399</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> being its cause. And when in theology the divine life is spoken of not as cause, nor in relation to something else, but absolutely and in itself, again it is not anything other than the Father and also the Son and the Holy Spirit. Such doctrines in no way give offence to those who affirm that God is uncreated, not only as regards His essence and hypostases, but also as regards the divine energy that is common to the three. We proclaim in our theology one God in three hypostases, possessing a single essence, power and energy, as well as whatever other realities pertain to the essence - realities that are called in Scripture assembly and fullness of divinity (cf Col. 2:9), and are perceived and theologically declared to belong to each of the three holy hypostases.</p>
      <p> 115. Those who reject this divine energy, saying sometimes that it is created, and sometimes that it differs in no respect from the divine essence, fabricate at other times a new heresy, teaching the doctrine that the sole uncreated energy is the only-begotten Son of the Father. In order to validate this view they appeal to the words of St Cyril: 'The life that the Father possesses in Himself is nothing other than the Son, and the life that is in the Son is nothing other than the Father. Thus He speaks the truth when He says, "1 am in the Father and the Father is in Me" (John 14:11).' Briefly and so far as we can we will now clarify the sense of the saint's words, and we will refute the impiety of those who in their undisceming darkness oppose us. They wrongly maintain that the Son is not only unlike the Father, but is also posterior to the Father, because He possesses the faculty of life and life itself not by nature, but as something added from without, and by participation and adventitiously, and because He takes and</p>
      <p> receives life from the Father, according to the words of Scripture, 'For as the Father has life in Himself, so has He granted the Son also to have life in Himself (John 5:26).</p>
      <p> St Cyril counters those who interpret the text of the Gospel in such an impious way. 'God', he says, 'is called life by virtue of His energy, as the Quickener of living things. He is Himself the life of things that naturally live, since He is the Creator of nature, just as He is also the Bestower of grace on those who live in a divine manner. But God is also said to be life in Himself, not in relation to another, but mdependently</p>
      <p> [V4] 400</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> and in every way unconditionally.' The divine Cyril wanted to show that in neither of these two cases does the Son differ from the Father, and that the fact that the Son receives something from .the Father does not indicate that He is posterior to the Father, or that where His essence is concerned the Son is second to the Father in a temporal sense. Thus among many other things St Cyril says, 'It is not as receiving something that the Son possesses being, but as being He receives something.' Then he adds in conclusion: 'Therefore, the fact that the Son receives something from the Father does not mean that where His essence is concerned the Son is second to the Father in a temporal sense.' Here, then, he does not accept that the life which the Father has and which the Son receives from the Father is the divine essence.</p>
      <p> 116.  Further, the divine Cyril shows that although the Son of God is said by virtue of His energy to be life in relation to living things, since He quickens them and is called their life, yet not even in this is He unlike the Father; rather, by nature He is their life and He quickens them, just as the Father does. Then, continuing, St Cyril writes, 'If the Son is not life by nature, how can He be speaking the truth when He says, "He that believes in Me has eternal life" (John 6:47), and again, "My sheep hear my voice, and I give them eternal life" (John 10:27-28)?' Shortly after St Cyril writes, 'To those who believe in Him He promises to give the life that belongs to and inheres in Him substantially. How, then, is it possible to think that the Son did not have this life but received it from the Father?' They should be ashamed, then, to say in their madness that, because this life is a natural attribute of God, therefore it must be identical with God's essence. For neither the Father, nor the Son, nor the Holy Spirit offers us believers their essence. We must dismiss such impiety.</p>
      <p> 117.   The great Cyril confutes in a similar way those who are infected with Barlaam's disease when he says shortly afterwards, 'In proceeding from the Father the Son takes with Him all that is by nature the Father's. Now one of the Father's attributes is life.' By the words, 'one of the Father's attributes', he clearly demonstrates that the</p>
      <p> [V4] 401</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> Father has many attributes. In the opinion of those who think that life is the essence of God, this must mean that God has many essences. Yet, apart from this impiety, to say that being and attribute are the same, except perhaps with regard to some particular relation, also displays excessive ignorance. And even more senseless is it to say that being and attributes - in other words, the one and what is more than one - are in no way different. For it is utterly and completely impossible and senseless to assert that something should be both one and many with respect to the same thing.</p>
      <p> 118.  In stating, then, that life is one of the Father's attributes, the divine Cyril shows that in this passage, when referring to life', he does not mean the essence of God. But let us produce his exact words where he states that God has many attributes. For slightly later he says, 'Many excellent properties pertain to the Father, but the Son is not without them either.' How could these many things that pertain to God be the divine essence? Wishing to indicate some of these excellent properties that pertain to the Father, he refers to the words of St Paul, To the immortal, invisible, and only wise God' (1 Tim. 1:17). Thus he shows even more clearly that none of God's attributes constitutes the essence. How, indeed, could immortality, invisibility, and in general all the things said of God privatively and apophatically, whether collectively or severally, be equated with the essence? For there is no essence unless there exists this or that definite object. If to the divine attributes described apophatically are added those that the theologians ascribe to God cataphatically, it is evident that none of them can be shown to disclose God's essence, even though when necessary we apply all the names of these attributes to the supra-essential Being that is absolutely nameless.</p>
      <p> 119.  When attributes are in question, we necessarily ask what they pertain to. If they do not pertain to anything, they are not attributes, and it is wrong to call them such. But if the attributes pertain to any one thing, and if this is the essence, which according to our adversaries in no way differs from each one of the attributes and all of them together, then, since there are many attributes, the one essence will be many essences; and that thing which is one in essence will be many in essence, and therefore will have many essences. But if it is one and also has many essences, it is necessarily composite. Delivering his adherents</p>
      <p> [V4] 402</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> from such impious and ignorant opinions, the divine Cyril says in his  Treasuries:  'If that which pertains to God alone is inevitably also His essence. He will be composed of many essences. For there are many thmgs that pertain by nature to God alone and to no other being. Indeed, the divine Scriptures call Him King, Lord, incorruptible, invisible, and say many thousands of other things about Him. If, then, each of His attributes is ranked with essence, how can the simple God not be composite? But this is a most absurd view to hold.'</p>
      <p> 120. By many arguments St Cyril, wise in things divine, shows that even though the Son is life and is said to possess life as energy, since He quickens us and is the life of living things, still He is not on this account unlike the</p>
      <p> Father, for the Father, too, bestows hfe. He wanted also to show that even when the Son is said to be hfe and to have hfe not in relation to something else but altogether independently and absolutely, yet in this case also He will not be unlike the Father with respect to life. For when we call God our life, not in so far as He bestows life on us, but altogether independently and absolutely, then we are naming His essence on the basis of the energy that pertains to Him by nature, as we do also when we call Him wisdom, goodness, and so on. Wishing, then, to demonstrate this, St Cyril says: 'When we say that "the Father has life in Himself" (John 5:16), we are at the same time calling the Son life, for He is other than the Father only with respect to His hypostasis, but not with respect to life. For this reason there is no question of compositeness or twofoldedness in the Father. And again, when we say that the Son has life in Himself, and we mean life absolute, we are at the same time calling the Father life. For as the Father is life, not in relation to anything else, but independently and in Himself, the Father and the Son coinhere in one another, as the Son Himself said: "I am in the Father and the Father is in Me" (John 14:11).' In this way, then, the divine Cyril demonstrates that the life that is in the Father - namely, the Son - is somehow both other and not other than the Father. But our opponents say that the life that is in the Father is in no way other than the Father and is entirely identical with Him since it is in no respect different By proposing such things and affirming that this life is the Only-begotten Son of the Father, they necessarily range</p>
      <p> [V4] 403</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> themselves not with the doctrines of the venerable Cyril but with those of Sabellius.</p>
      <p> 121.  Do not the followers of Barlaam and Akmdynos roundly condemn themselves when they claim that the divine Cyril contradicts himself? To affirm sometimes one thing, sometimes another, when both affirmations are true, is a distinguishing mark of every orthodox theologian. But to contradict oneself does not betoken an intelligent person. St Cyril quite rightly says that by nature the Son has life, which He gives to those who believe in Him. By this he shows that not only the essence of God - which no one receives - but also His natural energy is called life. This life has been received as a gift of grace by those whom He has quickened, and thus they themselves are able to save - that is to say, to render immortal in spirit - those who previously were not alive in spirit, and sometimes to restore people lifeless in one of their limbs or even in their whole body. How could St Cyril, who has demonstrated these things so excellently and clearly, subsequently assert, with the intention of denying what he has said about the divine energy, that only God's essence is called life? For this is what is senselessly maintained by those who now pervert or, rather, misrepresent, what St Cyril says.</p>
      <p> 122.  Not just the Only-begotten Son of God but also the Holy Spirit is called energy and power by the saints, and this because the Son and the Spirit possess precisely the same powers and energies as the Father. For according to St Dionysios God is called power, 'as both possessing it originally in Himself and transcending all power'. Therefore, whenever one of those two distinct hypostases, the Son and the Holy Spirit, is called power or energy, it is understood or expressed that He is so together with the Father. Thus St Basil the Great says. The Holy Spirit is a sanctifying power that possesses essence, existence and hypostatic subsistence.' But in his writing about the Spirit he</p>
      <p> also shows that the energies of the Spirit are none of them self-subsistent, in this way clearly distinguishing them in turn from created things; for what come forth from the Spirit as created objects</p>
      <p> [V4] 404</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> are independent existences, for God creates them as essences with specific qualities.</p>
      <p> 123.   Apophatic theology does not contradict or confute cataphatic theology, but it shows that although statements made cataphatically about God are true and reverent, yet they do not apply to God as they might to us. For example. God possesses knowledge of existent things, and we, too, possess this in some cases. But we know things in so far as they exist and have come into existence, whereas God does not know them solely in this way, since He knows them just as well even prior to their coming into existence. Thus he who says that God does not know existent things as existent does not contradict him who says that God knows existent things and knows them as existent. There is also a cataphatic theology which has the force of apophatic theologv, as when one says that all knowledge is affirmed of some object, namely, the thing known, while God's knowledge does not refer to any object. This is the same as saying God does not know existent things as existent, and He does not have knowledge of existent things -that is to say, does not have it as we do. In this way it can be said that in terms of His pre-eminence God does not exist But he who asserts this in order to show that people who say God exists are not speaking correctly, clearly employs apophatic theology not in a way that connotes pre-eminence, but as though it connoted deficiency and signified in this case that God has absolutely no existence whatsoever. This is the uttermost impiety, of which, alas, those are guilty who by means of apophatic theology attempt to deny that God has both an uncreated essence and uncreated energy. We, however, embrace both modes of theology, since the one does not exclude the other - rather, by means of each we confirm ourselves in a sound way of thought.</p>
      <p> 124.   I think a brief patristic quotation will be sufficient to confute utterly all the sophistries of Barlaam's followers and prove them to be sheer folly. St Gregory of Nazianzos says: 'The Unoriginate, the First Originate and the One who is with the First Originate, constitute one God. But the First Originate is not, because it is the First Originate, separated from the Unoriginate. For its origin is not its nature, any more than to be without origin is the nature of the other. These things pertain to the nature, but are not the nature itself" What, then? Shall we say that because origin and unongmateness are not nature but</p>
      <p> [V4] 405</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> pertain to the nature that they are therefore created? Not unless we are out of our mind. And is God composite because origin and unoriginateness are uncreated and pertain to His nature? Certainly not; for though they pertain to His nature, they are yet distinct from it. But, as St Cyril and other fathers teach at length, if the natural attributes of God are identified with the nature, then the Divinity is composite. Read through the writings against Eunomios by St Basil the Great and his brother, St Gregory of Nyssa, who fraternally shares his views. There you will find clearly that the followers of Barlaam and Akindynos are in agreement with Eunomios, and you will have ample refutations to use against them.</p>
      <p> 125.   The Eunomians asserted that the Father and the Son did not have the same essence, and they came to this conclusion because they imagined that everything predicated of God is said with regard to His essence; and so they contentiously argued that because to beget and to be begotten are different, on this account there are also different essences. The Akindynists assert that it cannot be one and the same God who possesses both a divine essence and divine energy, because they imagine that everything predicated of God is essence; and so they contentiously argue that, if there is any difference between divine essence and energy, there are also many different gods. To refute both groups it is enough to show that not everything predicated of God is said with regard to His essence; it can be said relatively, that is, with relation to something that is not God's essence. For example, the Father is spoken of in relation to the Son, for the Son is not the Father. And God is called Lord in relation to the subject creation, for God is Lord over beings that are in time and in the eternal age, and also Lord over the ages themselves. But this dominion is an uncreated energy of God, distinct from His essence in that it is said in relation to something else, something which He Himself is not</p>
      <p> 126.  The Eunomians maintain that everything that is attributed to God is essence. In this way they conclude that unbegottenness is God's essence, thus degrading - so far as they can - the Son to the rank of a creature because He differs from the Father. Their purpose, they claim, is to avoid positing two Gods; the first, unbegotten, and the one who comes second after Him, begotten. In imitation of the Eunomians, the Akindynists maintain that everything that is attributed to God is</p>

      <p> essence, and in this way they impiously degrade God's energy to the rank of creature - the energy that although inseparable from God nevertheless differs from His essence in that it originates from the essence and is participated in by created things; for, as St Dionysios says, 'AH things participate in the providence that wells forth from the Godhead, the Cause of all.' Their purpose, the Akindynists claim, is to avoid positing two Godheads: one, the tri-hypostatic essence that transcends name, cause, and participation; and the other, God's energy that proceeds from the essence, is participated in, and is named. They do not comprehend that, just as God the Father is called Father in relation to His own Son and fatherhood pertains to Him as an uncreated property, even though the name 'Father' does not betoken the essence, so likewise God possesses energy uncreatedly, even though energy differs from essence. When we speak of one Godhead, we speak of everything that God is, namely, both essence and energy.</p>
      <p> Consequently the Akindynists are the ones who impiously split God's single divinity into created and uncreated.</p>
      <p> 127.  An accident is that which comes into existence and passes out of existence, and in this way we can conceive of inseparable attributes as well. From one point of view, a natural attribute is also an accident, since it increases and decreases, as, for instance, knowledge in the soul endowed with intelligence. But there is no such thing in God because He remains entirely changeless. For this reason nothing can be attributed to Him that is an accident. Yet not all things said of God betoken His essence. For what belongs to the category of relation is also predicated of Him, and this is relative and refers to relationship with something else, and does not signify essence. Such is the divine energy in God. For it is not essence, nor an accident, even though it is called a kind of accident by some theologians, who mean to say simply this, that it is in God and that it is not essence.</p>
      <p> 128.  St Gregory of Nazianzos, when writing about the Holy Spirit, teaches us that, even though the divine energy is as it were also an accident, it is still seen to be m God without thereby making God composite. For he says, 'The Holy Spirit must either be ranked among beings that are self-existent or among those that are seen to be in another. Those skilled in such matters call the former essence and the latter accident. If the Holy Spirit were an accident. He would be an</p>
      <p> [V4] 407</p>

      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> energy of God. For what else, or of whom else, could He be? And this avoids making God composite.' He is clearly saying that if the Spirit is one of the things seen to be in God, and so is not essence, but is an accident and is called Spirit, He cannot be anything other than God's energy. This he indicated by saying, 'For what else, or of whom else, could He be?' In order to make it clear also that apart from energy nothing else - not quality, or quantity, or anything else of this kind - can be seen to be in God, he adds, 'And this avoids making God composite.' But how does the energy, though it is seen to be in God, not introduce composition into God? Because only God possesses completely impassible energy: He alone acts without being acted upon. He does not come into existence, nor does He change.</p>
      <p> 129.  Slightly before this, in contrasting this energy with what is created, St Gregory also shows that he regarded it as uncreated. For he says, 'Of the wise men among ourselves, some have supposed the Spirit to be an energy, others a created thing, and still others God.' By 'God' here he means the actual hypostasis; and by distinguishing the energy from what is created he clearly demonstrates that it is not created. Shortly afterwards he calls the energy an activity of God. How could God's activity not be uncreated? St John of Damaskos writes on this question: 'The energy is the dynamic and essential activity of the nature. That which possesses the capacity to energize is the nature from which the energy proceeds. That which is energized is the effect of the energy. That which energizes is what uses the energy, that is to say, the hypostasis.'</p>
      <p> 130.  In the same work St Gregory also says, 'If He is energy, then He will be energized but will not energize; and He will cease to exist once He has been energized.' From this the followers of Akmdynos conclude and declare that the divine energy is created. They do not understand that being energized can also be said of uncreated realities, as</p>
      <p> St Gregory shows when he says that if 'Father' is the name of an energy, 'then what the Father energizes will be the consubstantiality of the Son'. And St John of Damaskos also says, 'Christ sat at the right</p>
      <p> [V4] 408</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> hand of God, divinely energizing universal providence" Yet neither does the expression 'He rested' call in question the uncreated nature of the energy. For in creating God begins and ceases: as Moses says, 'God rested from all the works that He had begun to make' (Gen. 2:1). But the act of creating itself, with respect to which God begins and ceases, is a natural and uncreated energy of God.</p>
      <p> 131.   After saying, 'The energy is the dynamic and essential activity of the nature', St John of Damaskos seeks to demonstrate that, according to St Gregory of Nazianzos, this energy is both actuated and ceases to act. For he adds, 'We should realize that the energy is an activity and is energized rather than energizes. As St Gregory the Theologian says in his homily on the Holy Spirit, "If He is energy, then He will be energized but will not energize; and He will cease to exist once He has been energized".' Thus it is obvious that those who share the views of Barlaam and Akindynos, and who teach that the energy of which St Gregory here speaks is created, mindlessly degrade to the rank of a creature God's natural and essential energy. Yet St John of Damaskos, when he affirms that this energy is not only energized but also energizes, shows thereby that it is uncreated. That in this St John does not disagree with St Gregory I have made abundantly clear in my longer works.</p>
      <p> 132.  In God the hypostatic properties are affirmed relatively one to the other. The hypostases differ from each other, but not with respect to essence. Sometimes God is also referred to in relation to creation. Yet God, the All-Holy Trinity, cannot be called Father in the same way that He is called pre-etemal, pre-unoriginate, great and good. For it is not each of the three hypostases that is the Father, but only one of them, from whom and to whom subsequent realities are referred. None the less, in relation to creation the Trinity can also be called the Father, because creation is the joint work of the Three, brought forth from absolute nothingness, and because our adoption as sons is achieved through the bestowal of the grace common to the Three. The scriptural texts, 'The Lord your God is one Lord' (cf. Deut. 6:4) and 'One is our Father in heaven' (cf. Matt. 6:9; 23:9), refer to the Holy Trinity as our one Lord and God, and also as our Father who</p>
      <p> [V4] 409</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> through His grace confers on us a new birth. As we said, the Father is called Father only in relation to His</p>
      <p> coessential Son. In relation to both Son and Spirit He is called Principle, as He is also called Principle in relation to creation, but here in the sense that He is the Creator and Master of all creatures. Thus when the Father is called such things in relation to creation, the Son is also Principle, though they constitute not two Principles but one. For the Son is called Principle in relation to creation, as He is likewise called Master in relation to the created things subject to Him. Thus the Father and the Son, together with the Spirit, are - in relation to creation - one Principle, one Master, one Creator, one God and Father, one Provider and Overseer, and so on. Yet none of these properties constitute the essence, for if it was the essence it could not have been spoken of in relation to another.</p>
      <p> 133.  States, conditions, places, times, and any other such thing are not literally but metaphorically predicated of God. But to create and to energize can in the truest sense be predicated of God alone; for only God creates. He does not come into existence nor with respect to His essence is He acted upon. He alone through all things creates each one. He alone creates from absolute nothingness, since He possesses energy that is all-powerful. With respect to this energy He can be referred to in relation to creation and possesses potentiality. For He Himself in His own nature is not capable of being affected by anything at all, but if He wishes He is capable of adding to His creations. For God in His essence to be capable of being affected, of possessing or acquiring something, would denote weakness. But for God through His energy to be capable of creating, and of possessing and adding to His creations whenever He wishes, is a token of divinely fitting and almighty power.</p>
      <p> 134.  All existent things can be grouped into ten categories, namely, essence, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, activity, passivity, possession and dependence; and these ten categories apply likewise to everything subsequently seen to pertain to essence. But God is supra-essential essence, in which can be seen only relation and activity or creation, and these two things do not produce in His essence any composition or change. For God creates all things without being affected in His essence. He is Creator in relation to creation, and also its Principle and Master in that it has its origin in Him and is dependent on Him. But He is also our Father, since by grace He confers on us rebirth. Yet He is Father, too, in relation to the Son who is completely without any temporal beginning. The Son is Son in relation to the</p>
      <p> [V4] 410</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> Father, while the Spirit is the projection of the Father, coetemal with the Father and the Son, being of one and the same essence. Those who assert that God is only essence, with nothing to be seen in Him, fabricate a God who has neither creativity and energy nor relation. But if He whom they suppose to be God does not possess these properties, then He is neither active nor Creator, nor does He possess an energy; and neither is He Principle, Creator and Master, nor is He our Father by grace. For how could He be these things if relation and creativity are not to be envisaged in His essence? Furthermore, if relation is not to be envisaged in God's essence, the tri-hypostatic character of the Godhead is also abolished. But He who is not tn-hypostatic is not the Master of all or God. Thus those who hold the views of Barlaam and Akmdynos are atheists.</p>
      <p> 135. God also possesses that which is not essence. Yet because it is not essence it is not on that account an</p>
      <p> accident. For that which not only does not pass away but which also neither admits nor induces in itself the slightest increase or decrease, cannot be included among accidents. But the fact that it is neither an accident nor essence does not mean that it has no existence: it exists and it truly exists. It is not an accident, because it is altogether changeless. But again it is not an essence, because it is not among those things that are self-subsistent. It is because of this that some theologians say that it is in a certain way an accident, by which they wish only to indicate that it is not essence. But because each hypostatic property and each of the hypostases is neither an essence nor an accident in God, is it on this account totally nonexistent? Certainly not. In the same way, then. God's divine energy is neither an essence nor an accident, nor is it something utterly nonexistent. To speak in accord with all the theologians: if God creates by will and not simply because it is His nature to do so, then to will is one thing and natural being is another. If this is so, it means that God's volition is other than the divine essence. Does it follow from this that because in God the will is other than the nature and is not an essence it therefore does not exist at all? Certainly not: it does exist and it pertains to God, who possesses not only essence but also a will with which He creates. One may if one wishes say that it is in a certain way an accident, since it is not an essence; yet neither is it in the strict sense an accident, since it does not produce any composition or alteration. Thus God possesses both essence and that which is not essence, even if it should not be called an accident, namely, the divine will and energy.</p>
      <p> [V4]411</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> 136.   Unless an essence has an energy distinct from itself, it will entirely lack actual existence and will be a mere mental concept. For man as a general concept does not think, does not have opinions, does not see, does not smell, does not speak, does not hear, does not walk, does not breathe, does not eat and, in short, does not have an energy which is distinct from his essence, and which shows that he possesses an individual state of being. Thus man as a general concept entirely lacks actual existence. But when man possesses an inherent energy distinct from his essence, whether it be one or many or all of those activities we have mentioned, it is known thereby that he possesses an individual state of being and does not lack actual existence. And because these energies are observed not only in one or two or three but in a great number of individuals, it is clear that man exists in countless individual states of being.</p>
      <p> 137.   According to the true faith of God's Church which by His grace we hold, God possesses inherent energy that makes Him manifest and is in this respect distinct from His essence. For He foreknows and provides for inferior beings; He creates, sustains, rules and transforms them according to His own will and knowledge. In this way it is clear that He possesses an individual state of being, and that He is not simply essence lacking actual existence. But since all these energies are to be seen not in one but in three Persons, God is known to us as one essence existing in three individual states of being or hypostases. But the followers of Akmdynos, by asserting that God does not have inherent energy that makes Him manifest and is in this respect distinct from His essence, are saying that God does not possess an individual state of being, and they entirely deprive the tri-hypostatic Lord of actual existence. In this way they excel Sabellius the Libyan in heresy; for their total impiety is worse than his corrupt piety.</p>
      <p> 138. The energy of the three divine hypostases is one not in the sense that each has an energy similar to that of the others, as is the case with us, but in the sense of true numerical unity. This is something which those who hold the views of Akmdynos are unable to accept. For they say that there is no common, uncreated energy pertaining to the three hypostases and that the hypostases are energies of one another, since according to them there is no common divine energy. Thus they are unable to affirm that the three hypostases possess a single energy, and by excluding now one, now another energy they again deprive the tri-hypostatic God of actual existence.</p>
      <p> [V4] 412</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> 139.  Because those diseased in soul with Akmdynos's delusions say that the energy that is distinct from God's essence is created, they conclude that God's creative power is created. For it is impossible to act and create without an energy, just as it is impossible to exist without existence. Therefore, just as one cannot say that God's existence is created and at the same trnie affirm that His being is uncreated, so also one cannot say that God's energy is created and at the same time affirm that His power to act and create is uncreated.</p>
      <p> 140.  According to those who hold the true faith - and contrary to Akindynos's nonsensical and impious ramblings - created things are not the energy of God, but they are the effects of the divine energy. For if the created things are the energy, either such things are uncreated - which is sheer folly, for it would mean that they exist before they are created - or else prior to created things God possesses no energy; and this is mere godlessness. For of course God is eternally active and all-powerful. Thus creatures are not God's energy, but things that (whatever the precise terminology employed) have been actualized and effected. But God's energy, according to the theologians, is uncreated and coetemal with God.</p>
      <p> 141.  The energy is not known from the essence; but we do know from the energy that the essence exists, though we do not know what it is. Thus according to the theologians God's existence is known from His providence, not from His essence. Such, then, is the way in which energy can be distinguished from essence: the energy is that which makes known, while the essence is that whose existence is made known by the energy. The advocates of Akindynos's impiety,, in their anxiety to persuade us that the divine energy in no way differs from the divine essence, abolish that which makes God known, and so end up by trying to convince us that we cannot know that God exists - since they at any rate have no knowledge of Him. But he who does not even know that God exists will be the most godless and stupid of men.</p>
      <p> 142.  When the Akmdymsts say that, although God possesses an energy, it does not in any way differ from His essence, they attempt thus to cloak their own impiety and sophistically to mislead and deceive their hearers. Sabellius the Libyan likewise said that God the Father has a Son who differs in no way from the Father. But just as he was guilty of teaching that the Father is without a Son, since he denied their hypostatic distinction, so now these people are guilty of holding that God has no energy whatsoever, since they assert that the divine</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> energy in no way differs from the divine essence. If, indeed, there were no difference between these two, God would possess no capacity for creating and actuating, for according to the theologians it is impossible to act without an energy, just as it is impossible to exist without existence. For those who think rightly, there is also another fact which indicates that there is a difference between the divme energy and the divine essence. The energy actuates something else, not identical with the one who acts. God actuates and makes created things, but He Himself is uncreated. Further, a relationship is always affirmed in relation to something else: son is spoken of in relation to father, but a son is never father of his father. Therefore, as it is impossible for the relationship not to differ in any way from the essence and for it to be itself the essence instead of being in the essence, so likewise it is impossible for the energy not to differ from the essence but to be the essence, even though this may give offence to Akindynos.</p>
      <p> 143.  St Basil the Great, when he writes of God in his  Syllogistic Chapters,  says, 'The energy is neither the one who energizes nor that which is energized. Therefore the energy is not to be confused with the essence." St Cyril likewise affirms concerning God: To create pertains to energy, to beget pertains to nature. But nature and energy are not identical' And St John of Damaskos writes, 'Generation is an operation of the divine nature, but the creation is an operation of the divine will.' And elsewhere he says clearly, 'Energy is one thing and that which has the capacity to energize is another. For energy is the essential activity of the nature. That which possesses the capacity to energize is the nature from which the energy proceeds.' The energy, then, according to the holy fathers, differs in many ways from the divine essence.</p>
      <p> 144.  God's essence is entirely unnamable since it is also completely incomprehensible. Therefore we name it on the basis of all its energies, although with respect to the essence itself none of those names means anything different from any other. For by each name and by all names together nothing other is named except that which is hidden and whose real identity is unknown to all. But with respect to the energies.</p>
      <p> [V4] 414</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> each of these names has a different significance, for we all know that the acts of creating, ruling, judging, providential guidance, and of God's adopting us as sons through His grace, are acts that differ from one another. Thus when the Akindynists say that these natural, divine energies are created because they differ both from one another and from the divine nature, what else are they doing except degrading God and making Him a creature? For things that are created, ruled, judged and so on, are creatures and not the Creator, the Ruler, and the judge. And the same can be said of the acts of judging, ruling, and creating, which are acts that by nature pertain to God.</p>
      <p> 145.  Just as the essence of God is altogether without name because according to the theologians it transcends all names, so it is also miparticipable in that according to them it transcends participation. Thus those who in our day disbelieve the teaching of the Spirit given through our holy fathers and who revile us when we agree with the fathers, say that if the divine energy differs from the divine essence, even though it is envisaged as wholly pertaining to God's essence, then either there will be many gods or the one God will be composite. They are unaware that it is not activating and energy but being acted upon and passivity that produce composition. God activates without in any way being acted upon or subject to change. Thus He is not composite on account of His energy. Furthermore, God also possesses relationship and is related to creation, as being its Principle and Master; but He is not on this account numbered among things that have come into existence. And how will there be many gods because of God possessing an energy, since the energy pertains to one God or, rather, since God Himself is both the divine essence, and the divine energy? All this is clearly folly deriving from a demented state of mind.</p>
      <p> 146.  The Lord said to His disciples, 'There are some standing here who will not taste death till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power' (Mark 9:1); and after six days He took Peter, James and John, and when they had ascended Mount Tabor He shone like the sun, and His clothes became white as light (cf Matt. 17:1-2). When the disciples could look at it no longer or, rather, because they lacked the strength to gaze at the brightness, they fell prostrate to the earth (cf. Matt. 17:6). None the less, in accordance with the Savior's promise they did see the kingdom of God, that divine and inexpressible light. St Gregory of Nazianzos and, St Basil call this light 'divinity', saying that 'the light is the divinity manifested to the disciples on the</p>
      <p> [V4] 415</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> Mount', and that it is 'the beauty of Him who is almighty, and His noetic and contemplatable divinity'. St Basil the Great also says that this light is the beauty of God contemplated by the saints alone in the power of the divine Spirit; and again he writes, 'On the mountain Peter and the sons of thunder saw His beauty shining more brightly than the sun; and they were privileged to receive with their eyes a foretaste of His advent.' St John of Damaskos as well as St John Chrysostom call that light a natural ray of the Divinity. The former writes, 'Because the Son was begotten unoriginately from the Father, He possesses the natural, unongmate ray of the Divinity; and the glory of the Divinity becomes the glory of His body.' And St John Chrysostom says, 'The Lord appeared upon the mountain more radiant than Himself because the Divinity revealed its rays.'</p>
      <p> 147. This divine and inexpressible light. God's divinity and kingdom, the beauty and resplendence of the divine nature, the vision and delight of the saints in the age without end, the natural ray and glory of the Divinity - this the followers of Akindynos call an apparition and a creature. Further, they slanderously call ditheists those who refuse to blaspheme as they do against the divine light and who affirm God to be uncreated both in His essence and in His energy. But they should be ashamed, for though the divine light is uncreated, there is for us one God in one divinity, since, as has been shown above in many different ways, both the uncreated essence and the uncreated energy - that is, this divine grace and illumination - pertain to one God.</p>
      <p> 148. Because the followers of Akindynos at the Synod audaciously asserted and strove to demonstrate that the divine light that shone from the Savior on Tabor was an apparition and a creature, and because they did not change their views although they were frequently confuted, they were placed under a writ of excommunication and anathema. For they blaspheme God's economy in the flesh, and</p>
      <p> [V4] 416</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas Topics of Natural and Theological Science and on the Moral and Ascetic Life:</p>
      <p> One Hundred and Fifty Texts</p>
      <p> mindlessly say that God's divinity is created; and in this way-since the divinity of the three Persons is one and the same - they degrade the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit themselves to the rank of a creature. And when they claim to worship an uncreated divinity, they plainly profess that there are two divinities in God, the one created and the other uncreated. In this manner they strive to surpass in impiety all the ancient heretics.</p>
      <p> 149.  At other times these people contrive to conceal their heresy by saying that the light that shone on Tabor is both uncreated and also the essence of God, and in this they blaspheme in many ways. For since that light was seen by the apostles, these people perversely imagine that the essence of God is visible. Let them listen to him who says, 'No one has been in such a position as to see or disclose the essence and nature of God.' Not only men but also the angels are unable to do so; for even the six-winged Cherubim cover their faces with their wings because of the surpassing brilliance of the illumination shining from the divine essence (cf. Isa. 6:2). God's supraessentiality has never appeared to anyone at any time. Thus when the followers of Akindynos identify it with the light of the Transfiguration, what they are asserting is that this light is entirely invisible, that not even the chosen apostles were able to see it on Mount Tabor, that the Lord did not truthfully promise them the sight of it, and that he who said, 'We saw His glory when we were with Him in the holy mount' (cf. John 1: 14; 2 Pet. 1:18), and 'Peter and those with him stayed awake and saw His glory' (cf. Luke 9:32), did not speak the truth; nor did that other who says that Christ's especially beloved disciple 'saw disclosed upon the mountain the actual divinity of the Logos'. Thus they saw, they truly saw that uncreated and divine effulgence, while God yet continued invisible in His supraessential hiddenness, although Barlaam and Akmdynos and their followers may explode with indignation at this.</p>
      <p> 150.  Whenever one asks the Akindynists who say that the light of the Divinity is the essence: 'Is, then, the essence of God visible?', they are forced to unmask their treachery. For they assert that this light is the essence, since through it the essence of God is manifest; thus God's essence can be seen by means of created things. So once again these</p>

      <p> wretches assert that the hght of the Lord's Transfiguration is a created thing. Yet that which is seen through created things is not God's essence but His creative energy. Therefore those who say that by means of creatures God's essence is seen speak irrehgiously and in agreement with Eunomios, so prohfic is the crop of their impiety. Thus we should shun them and their company, for their teaching is a soul-destroying and many-headed serpent, corrupting the tme faith in a multitude of ways.</p>

      <p> St Gregory Palamas The Declaration of the Holy Mountain in Defense of Those who Devoutly Practice</p>
      <p> A Life of Stillness</p>
      <p> (Prologue)  The mysteries of the Mosaic law, once foreseen in the Spirit by the prophets alone, have now become doctrines known to all alike and openly proclaimed. Similarly the way of life according to the Gospel has also its own mysteries; and these are the blessings of the age to come which are promised to the saints, and which are now disclosed prophetically to those whom the Spirit accounts worthy, but only to a limited extent and as a pledge and a foretaste. If one of the Jews of old, lacking a proper spirit of reverence, were to hear the prophets proclaiming the Logos and the Spirit of God to be pre-etemal and coetemal with God, he might have stopped up his ears, supposing that he heard things forbidden to piety and opposed to what was openly confessed by true believers, namely. The Lord your God is one Lord' (cf Deut. 6:4). Similarly a person today who without proper reverence hears of the mysteries of the Spirit that are known only by those who have been purified through virtue might react in the same way. Agam, the fulfillment of the prophecies in the Old Testament showed the mysteries of that time to be concordant with what was later made manifest, so that now we believe in Father, Son and Holy Spirit, the tri-hypostatic Godhead, one simple, non-composite, uncreated, unseen, incomprehensible nature. Similarly, when in its own time the age to come is revealed according to the ineffable manifestation of the one God in three perfect hypostases, it will be clear that the present mysteries accord with all that is then made manifest.</p>
      <p> Yet we must also take into account the fact that, although the tri-hypostatic nature of the Godhead - that is in no way destroyed by the</p>

      <p> principle of unity - was in later times revealed to the ends of the earth, it was also fully known to the prophets prior to the fulfillment of the things prophesied and was readily accepted by those who trusted in them. In the same manner, even at this present time we are not ignorant of the doctrines of the Christian confession, both those which are openly proclaimed and those which are mystically and prophetically revealed by the Spirit to such as are accounted worthy. These are persons who have been initiated by actual experience, who have renounced possessions, human glory and the ugly pleasures of the body for the sake of the evangelical life; and not only this, but they have also: strengthened their renunciation by submitting themselves to those who have attained spiritual maturity in Christ. Through the practice of the life of stillness they devote their attention undistractedly to themselves and to God, and by transcending themselves through sincere prayer and by establishing themselves in</p>
      <p> God through their mystical and supra-intellectual union with Him they have been initiated into what surpasses the intellect. Others again have learnt about these things through their reverence, faith and love for such persons.</p>
      <p> When, therefore, we hear the great Dionysios in his second epistle to Gaios referring to God's deifying gift as 'divinity and the source of divinity and goodness', we conclude that the God who grants this grace to those worthy to receive it surpasses this divinity; for God does not suffer multiplicity, nor can we speak thus of two divinities. And St, Maximos, when speaking about Melchisedec, writes that this deifying grace of God is 'uncreated', declaring it to be 'eternally existent, proceeding from the eternally existing God', and elsewhere in many places he says it is a light, ungenerated and completely real, that is manifested to the saints when they become worthy of receiving it, though it does not come into being merely at that moment. He also calls this light 'the light of utterly inexpressible glory and the purity of angels'; while St Makarios calls it the nourishment of the bodiless, the glory of the divine nature, the beauty of the age to come, divine and celestial fire, inexpressible noetic light, foretaste and pledge of the Holy Spirit, the sanctifying oil of gladness.'</p>

      <p> 1.  If, then, anyone condemns as Messalians those who declare this deifying grace of God to be uncreated, ungenerated and completely real, and calls them ditheists, he must know - if indeed there is such a person - that he is an adversary of the saints of God, and that if he does not repent he excludes himself from the inheritance of the redeemed and falls away from Him who by nature is the one and only God professed by the saints. But if anyone believes, is persuaded by and concurs with the saints and does not 'make excuses to justify sin' (Ps. 141:4. LXX), and if although ignorant of the manner of the mystery he does not because of his ignorance reject what is clearly proclaimed, let him not refuse to enquire and learn from those who do possess knowledge. For he will find that there is nothing inconsistent either in the divine words and acts, especially with respect to those things that are most essential and without which nothing can stand firm, or in the sound doctrine that concerns ourselves, or in the mystery that is altogether divine.</p>
      <p> 2.  If anyone declares that perfect union with God is accomplished simply in an imitative and relative fashion, without the deifying grace of the Spirit and merely in the manner of persons who share the same disposition and who love one another, and that the deifying grace of God is a state of our intellectual nature acquired by imitation alone, but is not a supernatural illumination and an ineffable and divine energy beheld invisibly and conceived inconceivably by those privileged to participate in it, then he must know that he has fallen unawares into the delusion of the Messalians. For if deification is accomplished according to a capacity inherent in human nature and if it is encompassed within the bounds of nature, then of necessity the person deified is by nature God. Whoever thinks like this should not attempt, therefore, to foist his own delusion upon those who stand on secure ground and to impose a defiled creed upon those whose faith is undefiled; rather he should lay aside his presumption and learn</p>
      <p> from persons of experience or from their disciples that the grace of deification is entirely unconditional, and there is no faculty whatever in nature capable of achieving it since, if there were, this grace would no longer be grace but merely the manifestation of the operation of a natural capacity. Nor, if deification were in accord with a natural capacity, would there be anything miraculous in it; for then deification would truly be the work of nature, not the gift of God, and a man would be able to be and to be called a God by nature in the full sense of</p>
      <p> [V4] 421</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas The Declaration of the Holy Mountain in Defense of Those who Devoutly Practice</p>
      <p> A Life of Stillness</p>
      <p> the words. For the natural capacity of every being is nothing other than the undeviating and natural disposition for active accomplishment. It is, indeed, incomprehensible how deification can raise the person deified outside or beyond himself if it is encompassed within the bounds of nature.</p>
      <p> The grace of deification is, therefore, above nature, virtue and knowledge and, according to St Maximos, all such things infinitely fall short of it. For all the virtue we can attain and such imitation of God as lies in our power does no more than fit us for union with the Deity, but it is through grace that this ineffable union is actually accomplished. Through grace God in His entirety penetrates the saints in their entirety, and the saints in their entirety penetrate God entirely, exchanging the whole of Him for themselves, and acquiring Him alone as the reward of their ascent towards Him; for He embraces them as the soul embraces the body, enabling them to be in Him as His own members.</p>
      <p> 3. If anyone asserts that those who regard the intellect as seated in the heart or in the head are Messalians, let him know that he is misguidedly attacking the saints. For St Athanasios the Great says that the soul's intelligence resides in the head, and St Makarios, who is in no way inferior, says that the intellect is active in the heart; and nearly all the saints concur with them. When St Gregory of Nyssa writes that the intellect is neither within the body nor outside it for it is bodiless, this does not contradict what all these other saints affirm; for they say that the intellect is in the body because it is united to it, and thus they state the same thing in a different fashion, not in the least disagreeing with St Gregory. For if someone says that the Logos of God once dwelt within a virginal and immaculate womb, out of ineffable divine compassion united there to our human substance, he does not contradict someone who maintains that whatever is divine is not contained within a place because it is unembodied.</p>
      <p> [V4] 422</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas The Declaration of the Holy Mountain in Defense of Those who Devoutly Practice</p>
      <p> A Life of Stillness</p>
      <p> 4. If anyone maintains that the light which shone about the disciples on Mount Tabor was an apparition and a symbol of the kind that now is and now is not, but has no real being and is an effect that not only does not surpass</p>
      <p> comprehension, but is inferior to it, he clearly contends against the doctrines of the saints. For the saints both in hymns and in their writings call this light ineffable, uncreated, eternal, timeless, unapproachable, boundless, infinite, limitless, invisible to angels and men, archetypal and unchanging beauty, the glory of God, the glory of Christ, the glory of the Spirit, the ray of Divinity and so forth. The flesh of Christ, it is said, is glorified at the moment of its assumption and the glory of the Godhead becomes the body's glory. But this glory was invisible in His visible body to those unable to perceive that upon which even angels cannot gaze. Thus Christ was transfigured, not by the addition of something He was not, nor by a transformation into something He was not, but by the manifestation to His disciples of what He really was. He opened their eyes so that instead of being blind they could see. While He Himself remained the same, they could now see Him as other than He had appeared to them formerly. For He is 'the true light' (John 1:9), the beauty of divine glory, and He shone forth like the sun - though this image is imperfect, since what is uncreated cannot be imaged in creation without some diminution.</p>
      <p> 5. If anyone maintains that only God's essence is uncreated, while His eternal energies are not uncreated, and that as what energizes transcends all it activates, so God transcends all His energies, let him listen to St Maximos, who says: 'AH immortal things and immortality itself, all living things and life itself, all holy things and holiness itself, all good things and goodness itself, all blessings and blessedness itself, all beings and being itself are manifestly works of God. Some began to be in time, for they have not always existed. Others did not begin to be in time, for goodness, blessedness, holiness and immortality have always existed.'' And again he says: 'Goodness, and all that is included in the principle of goodness, and - to be brief - all life, immortality, simplicity, immutability and infinity, and all the other qualities that</p>
      <p> '  Texts  on  Theology  i, 50: E.T.,  The Philokalia,  vol. ii, p. 124.</p>
      <p> [V4] 423</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas The Declaration of the Holy Mountain in Defense of Those who Devoutly Practice</p>
      <p> A Life of Stillness</p>
      <p> contemplative vision perceives as substantively appertaining to God, are realities of God which did not begin to be in time. For non-existence is never prior to goodness, nor to any of the other things we have listed, even if those things which participate in them do in themselves have a beginning in time. All goodness is without beginning because there is no time prior to it: God is eternally the unique author of its being, and God is infinitely above all beings, whether participant or participable.'' It is clear, therefore, from what has been said that not everything which issues from God is subject to time. For there are some things issuing from God that are without beginning, without this in the least impairing the principle of the Triadic Unity, that alone is intrinsically without beginning, or God's supraessential simplicity. In the same way the intellect, which is the imperfect image of that transcendent indivisibility, is not in the least compound because of the variety of its inherent intellections.</p>
      <p> 6. If anyone does not acknowledge that spiritual dispositions are stamped upon the body as a consequence of the gifts of the Spirit that exist in the soul of those advancing on the spiritual path; and if he does not regard dispassion as a state of aspiration for higher things that leads a person to free himself from evil habits by completely spuming what is evil and to acquire good habits by espousing what is good, but considers it to be the deathlike condition of the soul's passible aspect, then, by adhering to such views, he inevitably denies that we can enjoy an embodied life</p>
      <p> in the world of incorruption that is to come. For if in the age to come the body is to share with the soul in ineffable blessings, then it is evident that in this world as well it will also share according to its capacity in the grace mystically and ineffably bestowed by God upon the purified intellect, and it will experience the divine in conformity with its nature. For once the soul's passible aspect is transformed and sanctified - but not reduced to a deathlike condition - through it the dispositions and activities of the body are also sanctified, since body and soul share a conjoint existence. As St Diadochos states, in the case of those who have abandoned the delights of this age in the hope of enjoying the blessings of eternity, the intellect, because of its freedom from worldly cares, is able to act with its full vigor and becomes capable of perceiving the ineffable goodness of God. Then according to the measure of its own progress it</p>

      <p> communicates its joy to the body too, and this joy which then fills both soul and body is a true recalling of incorruptible life.'</p>
      <p> The intellect perceives one light, and the senses another. The senses perceive sensible light, which manifests sensory things as sensory. The light of the intellect is the spiritual knowledge inherent in intellection. Thus sight and intellect do not perceive the same light, but each operates to the limit of its nature in what is natural to it. When saintly people become the happy possessors of spiritual and supernatural grace and power, they see both with the sense of sight and with the intellect that which surpasses both sense and intellect in the manner that - to use the expression of St Gregory of Nazianzos - 'God alone knows and those in whom these things are brought to pass'.</p>

      <p> AGE  (aicbv - aeon):  the ensemble of cosmic duration. It includes the angelic orders, and is an attribute of God as</p>
      <p> the principle and consummation of all the centuries created by Him. The term is used more particularly in two ways:</p>
      <p> (i) Frequently a distinction is made between the 'present age' and the 'age to come' or the 'new age'. The first corresponds to our present sense of time, the second to time as it exists in God, that is, to eternity understood, not as endless time, but as the simultaneous presence of all time. Our present sense of time, according to which we experience time as sundered from God, is the consequence of the loss of vision and spiritual perception occasioned by the fall and is on this account more or less illusory. In reality time is not and never can be sundered from God, the 'present age' from the 'age to come'. Because of this the 'age to come' and its realities must be thought of, not as non-existent or as coming into existence in the future, but as actualities that by grace we can experience here and now. To indicate this, the Greek phrase for these realities (   e   , - ta</p>
      <p> mellonta)  is often translated as 'the blessings held in store'.</p>
      <p> (ii) Certain texts, especially in St Maximos the Confessor, also use the term  aeon  in a connected but more specific way, to denote a level intermediate between eternity in the full sense  (aiSldTrjg - aidiotis)  and time as known to us in our present experience (  m g - chronos).  Where this is the case we normally employ the rendering 'aeon' instead of 'age'. There are thus three levels:</p>
      <p> (a) eternity, the  totum simiil  or simultaneous presence of all time and reality as known to God, who alone has neither origin nor end, and who therefore is alone eternal in the full sense;</p>
      <p> (b) the aeon, the  totiim simul  as known to the angels, and also to human persons who possess experience of the 'age to come':</p>
      <p> [VI] 358, [V2] 380, [V3] 356, [V4] 428</p>
      <p> Glossary</p>
      <p> although having no end, these angelic or human beings, since they are created, are not self-originating and therefore are not eternal in the sense that God is eternal;</p>
      <p> (c) time, that is, temporal succession as known to us in the 'present age'.</p>
      <p> APPETITIVE ASPECT OF THE soul, or the soul's desiring power  {to smOvfirjiiKov- to epithymitikon):  one of the three aspects or powers of the soul according to the tripartite division formulated by Plato (see his  Republic, Book iv, 4.34D-441C) and on the whole accepted by the Greek Christian Fathers. The other two are, first, the intelligent aspect or power  (to  Xoyiatixov - to logistikon: see  Intelligent); and, second, the incensive aspect or power  (to  OvfUKov - to thymikon),  which often manifests itself as wrath or anger, but which can be more generally defined as the force provoking vehement feelings. The three aspects or powers can be used positively, that is, in accordance with nature and as created by God, or negatively, that is, in a way contrary to nature and leading to sin (q.v.). For instance, the incensive power can be used positively to repel demonic attacks or to intensify desire for God; but it can also, when not controlled, lead to self-indulgent, disruptive thought and action.</p>
      <p> The appetitive and incensive aspects, in particular the former, are sometimes termed the soul's passible aspect  (to  KaOrjTiKov - to pathitikon),  that is to say, the aspect which is more especially vulnerable to  pathos  or passion (q.v.), and which, when not transformed by positive spiritual influences, is susceptive to the influence of negative and self-destructive forces. The intelligent aspect, although also susceptible to passion, is not normally regarded as part of the soul's passible aspect.</p>
      <p> ASSENT  (avyKardOecng - synkatathesis): see  Temptation.</p>
      <p> ATTENTIVENESS  {jipoaox') -prosochi): see  Watchfulness.</p>
      <p> COMPUNCTION  {Kardw^iQ - katanyxis):  in our version sometimes also translated 'deep penitence'. The state of one who is 'pricked to the heart', becoming conscious both of his own sinfulness and of the forgiveness extended to him by God; a mingled feeling of sorrow, tenderness and joy, springing from sincere repentance (q.v.).</p>
      <p> CONCEPTUAL IMAGE  {vorjua - noyma): see  Thought.</p>
      <p> CONTEMPLATION  (Oecopia - theoria):  the perception or vision of</p>
      <p> Glossary</p>
      <p> the intellect (q.v.) through which one attains spiritual knowledge (q.v.). It may be contrasted with the practice of the virtues  {npaKTiKrj - praktiki)  which designates the more external aspect of the ascetic life - purification and the keeping of the commandments - but which is an indispensable prerequisite of contemplation. Depending on the level of personal spiritual growth, contemplation has two main stages: it may be either of the inner essences or principles (q.v.) of created beings or, at a higher stage, of God Himself.</p>
      <p> COUPLING  {awdvaai^ioQ - syndyasmos): see  Temptation.</p>
      <p> DELUSION  {jiXavrj - plani): see  Illusion.</p>
      <p> DESIRE, Desiring power of the soul:  see  Appetitive aspect of the soul.</p>
      <p> DISCRIMINATION  (diaKpiaiq - diakrisis):  a spiritual gift permitting one to discriminate between the types of thought that enter into one's mind, to assess them accurately and to treat them accordingly. Through this gift one gains 'discernment of spirits' - that is, the ability to distinguish between the thoughts or visions inspired by God and the suggestions or fantasies coming from the devil. It is a kind of eye or lantern of the soul by which man finds his way along the spiritual path without falling into extremes; thus it includes the idea of discretion. DISPASSION  (anaQsia - apatheia):  among the writers of the texts here translated, some regard passion (q.v.) as evil and the consequence of sin (q.v.), and for them dispassion signifies passionlessness, the uprooting of the passions; others, such as St Isaiah the Solitary, regard the passions as fundamentally good, and for them dispassion signifies a state in which the passions are exercised in accordance with their original purity and so without committing sin in act or thought. Dispassion is a state of reintegration and spiritual freedom; when translating the term into Latin, Cassian rendered it 'purity of heart'. Such a state may imply impartiality and detachment, but not indifference, for if a dispassionate man does not suffer on his own account, he suffers for his fellow creatures. It consists, not in ceasing to feel the attacks of the demons, but in no longer yielding to them. It is positive, not negative: Evagrios links it closely with the quality of love  (agape)  and Diadochos speaks of the 'fire of dispassion' (§ 17: in our translation, vol. i, p. 258). Dispassion is among the gifts of God.</p>

      <p> Glossary</p>
      <p> ECSTASY  {eKoraaiQ - ekstasis):  a 'going out' from oneself and from all created things towards God, under the influence of  eros  or intense longing (q.v.). A man does not attain ecstasy by his own efforts, but is drawn out of himself by the power of God's love. Ecstasy implies a passing beyond all the conceptual thinking of the discursive reason (q.v.). It may sometimes be marked by a state of trance, or by a loss of normal consciousness; but such psychophysical accompaniments are in no way essential. Occasionally the term  ekstasis  is used in a bad sense, to mean infatuation, loss of self-control, or madness.</p>
      <p> FAITH  (jiiariQ - pistis):  not only an individual or theoretical belief in the dogmatic truths of Christianity, but an all-embracing relationship, an attitude of love and total trust in God. As such it involves a transformation of man's entire life. Faith is a gift from God, the means whereby we are taken up into the whole theanthropic activity of God in Christ and of man in Christ through which man attains salvation.</p>
      <p> FALLEN NATURE  {naXaioQ dvOpmnoq -palaios anthropos):  literally, the 'old man'. See Flesh, sense (ii).</p>
      <p> FANTASY  {(pavraaia -fantasia):  denoting the image-producing faculty of the psyche, this is one of the most important words in the hesychast vocabulary. As one begins to advance along the spiritual path one begins to 'perceive' images of things which have no direct point of reference in the external world, and which emerge inexplicably from within oneself This experience is a sign that one's consciousness is beginning to deepen: outer sensations and ordinary thoughts have to some extent been quietened, and the impulses, fears, hopes, passions hidden in the subconscious region are beginning to break through to the surface. One of the goals of the spiritual life is indeed the attainment of a spiritual knowledge (q.v.) which transcends both the ordinary level of consciousness and the subconscious; and it is true that images, especially when the recipient is in an advanced</p>
      <p> spiritual state, may well be projections on the plane of the imagination of celestial archetypes, and that in this case they can be used creatively, to form the images of sacred art and iconography. But more often than not they will simply derive from a middle or lower sphere, and will have nothing spiritual or creative about them. Hence they correspond to the world of fantasy and not to</p>
      <p> [VI] 361, [V2] 383, [V3] 359, [V4] 431</p>
      <p> Glossary</p>
      <p> the world of the imagination in the proper sense. It is on this account that the hesychastic masters on the whole take a negative attitude towards them. They emphasize the grave dangers involved in this kind of experience, especially as the very production of these images may be the consequence of demonic or diabolic activity; and they admonish those still in the early stages and not yet possessing spiritual discrimination (q.v.) not to be enticed and led captive by these illusory appearances, whose tumult may well overwhelm the mind. Their advice is to pay no attention to them, but to continue with prayer and invocation, dispelling them with the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p> FLESH  (aap^ - sarx):  has various senses: (i) the human in contrast to the divine, as in the sentence, 'The Logos became flesh' (John 1:14); (ii) fallen and sinful human nature in contrast to human nature as originally created and dwelling in communion with God; man when separated from God and in rebellion against Him; (iii) the body in contrast to the soul. The second meaning is probably the most frequent. If the word is being employed in this sense, it is important to distinguish 'flesh' from 'body'  (achjua - soma).  When St Paul lists the 'works of the flesh' in Gal. 5: 19-21, he mentions such things as 'seditions', 'heresy' and 'envy', which have no special connection with the body. In sense (ii) of the word, 'flesh' denotes the  whole  soul-body structure in so far as a man is fallen; likewise 'spirit' denotes the whole soul-body structure in so far as a man is redeemed. The soul as well as the body can become fleshly or 'carnal', just as the body as well as the soul can become spiritual. Asceticism involves a war against the flesh - in sense (ii) of the word - but not against the body as such.</p>

      <p> HEART  {xapdia - kardia):  not simply the physical organ but the spiritual centre of man's being, man as made in the image of God, his deepest and truest self, or the inner shrine, to be entered only through sacrifice and death, in which the mystery of the union between the divine and the human is consummated. ' "I called with my whole heart", says the psalmist - that is, with body, soul and spirit' (John Klimakos,  The Ladder of Divine Ascent,  Step 28, translated by Archimandrite Lazarus [London, 1959], pp. 257-8).</p>

      <p> 'Heart' has thus an all-embracing significance: 'prayer of the heart' means prayer not just of the emotions and affections, but of the whole person, including the body.</p>
      <p> ILLUSION  {jiXavrj - plani):  in our version sometimes also translated 'delusion'. Literally, wandering astray, deflection from the right path; hence error, beguilement, the acceptance of a mirage mistaken for trath. Cf. the literal sense of sin (q.v.) as 'missing the mark'.</p>

      <p> INTELLECT  (yoijq - nous):  the highest faculty in man, through which - provided it is purified - he knows God or the inner essences or principles (q.v.) of created things by means of direct apprehension or spiritual perception. Unlike the  dianoia  or reason (q.v.), from which it must be carefully distinguished, the intellect does not function by formulating abstract concepts and then arguing on this basis to a conclusion reached through deductive reasoning, but it understands divine truth by means of immediate experience, intuition or 'simple cognition' (the term used by St Isaac the Syrian). The intellect dwells in the 'depths of the soul'; it constitutes the innermost aspect of the heart (St Diadochos, §§ 79, 88: in our translation, vol. i, pp. 280, 287). The intellect is the organ of</p>
      <p> contemplation (q.v.), the 'eye of the heart'  (Makarian Homilies).</p>
      <p> INTELLECTION  (vorjaig - noisis):  not an abstract concept or a visual image, but the act or function of the intellect (q.v.) whereby it apprehends spiritual realities in a direct manner.</p>
      <p> INTELLIGENT  (Xojikoq  - logikos):  the Greek term  logikos  is so closely connected with Logos (q.v.), and therefore with the divine Intellect, that to render it simply as 'logical' and hence descriptive of the reason (q.v.) is clearly inadequate. Rather it pertains to the intellect (q.v.) and qualifies the possessor of spiritual knowledge (q.v.). Hence when found in conjunction with 'soul'  (logiki psychi), logikos is  translated as 'deiform' or as 'endowed with intelligence'. Intelligence itself  (to  Xojikov  - to logikon; x6 loyiaiiKov - to logistikon; 'o Xoyia^og -ho logismos)  is the ruling aspect of the intellect (q.v.) or its operative faculty.</p>
      <p> INTENSE LONGING  (spojg - eros):  the word  eros,  when used in these</p>
      <p> [VI] 363, [V2] 385, [V3] 361, [V4] 433</p>
      <p> Glossary</p>
      <p> texts, retains much of the significance it has in Platonic thought. It denotes that intense aspiration and longing which impel man towards union with God, and at the same time something of the force which links the divine and the human. As unitive love  par excellence,  it is not distinct from  agapi,  but may be contrasted with  agapi  in that it expresses a greater degree of intensity and ecstasy (q.v.).</p>
      <p> INTIMATE COMMUNION  {nappiaia - parrisia):  literally, 'Rankness', 'freedom of speech'; hence freedom of approach to God, such as Adam possessed before the fall and the saints have regained by grace; a sense of confidence and loving trust in God's mercy.</p>
      <p> JESUS PRAYER  (Irjaoi) ehji] -Tisou evchi):  the invocation of the name of Jesus, most commonly in the words, 'Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me', although there are a number of variant forms. Not merely a 'technique' or a 'Christian mantra', but a prayer addressed to the Person of Jesus Christ, expressing our living faith (q.v.) in Him as Son of God and Saviour.</p>
      <p> LOGOS  {Adyoq - Logos):  the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, or the Intellect, Wisdom and Providence of God in whom and through whom all things are created. As the unitary cosmic principle, the Logos contains in Himself the multiple  logoi  (inner principles or inner essences, thoughts of God) in accordance with which all things come into existence at the times and places, and in the forms, appointed for them, each single thing thereby containing in itself the principle of its own development. It is these  logoi,  contained principally in the Logos and manifest in the forms of the created universe, that constitute the first or lower stage of Contemplation (q.v.).</p>
      <p> MIND: see Reason.</p>
      <p> NOETIC:  {vorjTOQ - no'itos):  that which belongs to or is characteristic of the intellect (q.v.).  See also  Intellection.</p>
      <p> PASSION  (ndOog - pathos):  in Greek, the word signifies literally that which happens to a person or thing, an experience undergone passively; hence an appetite or impulse such as anger, desire or jealousy, that violently dominates the soul. Many Greek Fathers regard the passions as something intrinsically evil, a 'disease' of the soul: thus St John Klimakos affirms that God is not the creator of the passions and that they are 'unnatural', alien to man's true</p>
      <p> [VI] 364, [V2] 386, [V3] 362, [V4] 434</p>
      <p> Glossary</p>
      <p> self  (The Ladder of Divine Ascent,  Step 26, translated by Archimandrite Lazarus [op. Cit.], p. 211). Other Greek Fathers, however, look on the passions as impulses originally placed in man by God, and so fundamentally good, although at present distorted by sin (cf St Isaiah the Solitary, § 1: in our translation, vol. i, p. 22). On this second view, then, the passions are to be educated, not eradicated; to be transfigured, not suppressed; to be used positively, not negatively  {see  Dispassion). PRACTICE OF THE VIRTUES  {jipaKTiKrj - praktiki): see  Contemplation.</p>
      <p> PREPOSSESSION  (Tzpolrjif/ig -prolipsis): see  Temptation.</p>
      <p> PROVOCATION  {jipoaPoXi) - prosvofi): see  Temptation.</p>
      <p> REASON, mind  {didvoia - dianoia):  the discursive, conceptualizing and logical faculty in man, the function of</p>
      <p> which is to draw conclusions or formulate concepts deriving from data provided either by revelation or spiritual</p>
      <p> knowledge (q.v.) or by sense-observation. The knowledge of the reason is consequently of a lower order than</p>
      <p> spiritual knowledge (q.v.) and does not imply any direct appre- hension or perception of the inner essences or</p>
      <p> principles (q.v.) of created beings, still less of divine truth itself Indeed, such apprehension or perception, which</p>
      <p> is the function of the intellect (q.v.), is beyond the scope of the reason. REBUTTAL  {dvnXoyia - antilogia; avtipprjaic - antirrisis):  the repulsing of a demon or demonic thought at the</p>
      <p> moment of provocation (q.v.); or, in a more general sense, the bridling of evil thoughts. REMEMBRANCE OF GOD  (jivrjiirj - mnimi Theou):  not just calling God to mind, but the state of recoUectedness or</p>
      <p> concentration in which attention is centred on God. As such it is the opposite of the state of self-indulgence and</p>
      <p> insensitivity. REPENTANCE  (jisxavoia - metanoia):  the Greek signifies primarily a 'change of mind' or 'change of intellect': not</p>
      <p> only sorrow, contrition or regret, but more positively and fundamentally the conversion or turning of our whole</p>
      <p> life towards God. SENSUAL PLEASURE  {r\dovi\ - hidoni):  according to the context the Greek term signifies either sensual pleasure</p>
      <p> (the most frequent meaning) or spiritual pleasure or delight. SIN  (dfiapiia - hamartia):  the primary meaning of the Greek word is 'failure' or, more specifically, 'failure to hit the</p>
      <p> mark' and so a</p>
      <p> [VI] 365, [V2] 387, [V3] 363, [V4] 435</p>
      <p> Glossary</p>
      <p> 'missing of the mark', a 'going astray' or, ultimately, 'failure to achieve the purpose for which one is created'. It is closely related, therefore, to illusion (q.v.). The translation 'sin' should be read with these connotations in mind.</p>
      <p> SORROW  {XuTirj -  lypi): often with the sense of 'godly sorrow' - the sorrow which nourishes the soul with the hope engendered by repentance (q.v.).</p>
      <p> SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE  {yvmaig - gnosis):  the knowledge of the intellect (q.v.) as distinct from that of the reason (q.v.). As such it is knowledge inspired by God, and so linked with contemplation (q.v.) and immediate spiritual perception.</p>
      <p> STILLNESS  {rjavxia - hesychia):  from which are derived the words hesychasm and hesychast, used to denote the whole spiritual tradition represented in  The Philokalia  as well as the person who pursues the spiritual path it delineates (see Introduction, vol. i, pp. 14-16): a state of inner tranquillity or mental quietude and concentration which arises in conjunction with, and is deepened by, the practice of pure prayer and the guarding of heart (q.v.) and intellect (q.v.). Not simply silence, but an attitude of listening to God and of openness towards Him.</p>
      <p> TEMPERAMENT  (Kpdaig - krasis):  primarily the well-balanced blending of elements, humours or qualities in animal bodies, but sometimes extended to denote the whole soul-body structure of man. In this sense it is the opposite to a state of psychic or physical disequilibrium.</p>
      <p> TEMPTATION  (Tzsipaajxoq - peirasmos):  also translated in our version as 'trial' or 'test'. The word indicates, according to context: (i) a test or trial sent to man by God, so as to aid his progress on the spiritual way; (ii) a suggestion from the devil, enticing man into sin.</p>
      <p> Using the word in sense (ii), the Greek Fathers employ a series of technical terms to describe the process of temptation. (See in particular Mark the Ascetic,  On the Spiritual Law,  §§ 138-41, in vol. i of our translation, pp. 119-20; John Klimakos,  Ladder,  Step 15 translated by Archimandrite Lazarus [op. cit.], pp. 157-8; Maximos,  On Love,  i, §§ 83-84, in vol. ii of our translation, pp. 62-63; John of Damaskos,  On the J'irtues and J'ices,  also in vol. ii of our translation, pp. 337-8.) The basic distinction made by these Fathers is between the demonic provocation  and man's</p>
      <p> Glossary</p>
      <p> assent:  the first lies outside man's control, while for the second he is morally responsible. In detail, the chief terms employed are as follows:</p>
      <p> (i) Provocation {npoaPoXrj - prosvoli):  the initial incitement to evil. Mark the Ascetic defines this as an 'image-free stimulation in the heart'; so long as the provocation is not accompanied by images, it does not involve man in any guilt. Such provocations, originating as they do from the devil, assail man from the outside independently of his free will, and so he is not morally responsible for them. His liability to these provocations is not a consequence of the fall: even in paradise, Mark maintains, Adam was assailed by the devil's provocations. Man cannot prevent provocations from assailing him; what does lie in his power, however, is to maintain constant watchfulness (q.v.) and so to reject each provocation as soon as it emerges into his consciousness - that is to say, at its first appearance as a thought in his mind or intellect ([xovoXoyioxoc; -  monologistos emphasis).  If he does reject the provocation, the sequence is cut off and the process of temptation is terminated.</p>
      <p> (ii) Momentary disturbance (Tiapappimafiog - pararripismos)  of the intellect, occurring 'without any movement or working of bodily passion' (see Mark,  Letter to Nicolas the Solitary:  in our translation, vol. i, p. 153). This seems to be more than the 'first appearance' of a provocation described in stage (i) above; for, at a certain point of spiritual growth in this life, it is possible to be totally released from such 'momentary disturbance, whereas no one can expect to be altogether free from demonic provocations.</p>
      <p> (Hi) Communion (oixiXia - homilia); coupling (avvdvaa/uog - syndyasmos).  Without as yet entirely assenting to the demonic provocation, a man may begin to 'entertain' it, to converse or parley with it, turning it over in his mind pleasurably, yet still hesitating whether or not to act upon it. At this stage, which is indicated by the terms 'communion' or 'coupling', the provocation is no longer 'image-free' but has become a  logismos  or thought (q.v.); and a person is morally responsible for having allowed this to happen.</p>
      <p> (iv) Assent (auyKamOeaic - synkatathesis).  This signifies a step beyond mere 'communion' or 'coupling'. No longer merely 'playing' with the evil suggestion, a person now resolves to act upon it. There is now no doubt as to his moral culpability: even if</p>
      <p> [VI] 367, [V2] 389, [V3] 365, [V4] 437</p>
      <p> Glossary</p>
      <p> circumstances prevent him from sinning outwardly, he is judged by God according to the intention in        his heart.</p>
      <p> (v) Prepossession {npoXi-jif/iQ - prolipsis):  defined by Mark- as 'the involuntary presence of former sins in the memory'. This state of 'prepossession' or prejudice results from repeated acts of sin which predispose a man to yield to particular temptations. In principle he retains his free choice and can reject demonic provocations; but in practice the force of habit makes it more and more difficult for him to resist.</p>
      <p> (vi) Passion  (q.v.). If a man does not fight strenuously against a prepossession, it will develop into an evil passion.</p>
      <p> THEOLOGY  (QeoXoyia - theologia):  denotes in these texts far more than the learning about God and religious doctrine acquired through academic study. It signifies active and conscious participation in or perception of the realities of the divine world - in other words, the realization of spiritual knowledge (q.v.). To be a theologian in the full sense, therefore, presupposes the attainment of the state of stillness (q.v.) and dispassion (q.v.), itself the concomitant of pure and undistracted prayer, and so requires gifts bestowed on but extremely few persons.</p>
      <p> THOUGHT  {XoyiajxoQ - logismos; vorjfia - noima):  (i) frequently signifies not thought in the ordinary sense, but thought provoked by the demons, and therefore often qualified in translation by the adjective 'evil' or 'demonic'; it can also signs divinely-inspired thought; (ii) a 'conceptual image', intermediate between fantasy (q.v.) and an abstract concept; this sense of  noima  is frequent in the texts of St Maximos, where the rendering 'conceptual image' is normally adopted.</p>
      <p> WATCHFULNESS  {vrjif/iQ - nipsis):  literally, the opposite to a state of drunken stupor; hence spiritual sobriety, alertness, vigilance. It signifies an attitude of attentiveness  {npoaoxrj - prosochi),  whereby one keeps watch over one's inward thoughts and fantasies (q.v.), maintaining guard over the heart and intellect  ((pvXaKrj Kapdiag/vov -phylaki kardias/noii; rriprjaig Kapdiag/voi) -  tirisis kardias/nou). In Hesychios,  On Watchfulness and Holiness, §§ 1-6 (in our translation. Vol. i, pp. 162-3), watchfulness is given a very broad definition, being used to indicate the whole range of the practice of the virtues. It is closely linked with purity of heart and stillness (q.v.). The Greek title of  The Philokalia  is 'The</p>
      <p> [VI] 368, [V2] 390, [V3] 366, [V4] 438</p>
      <p> Glossary</p>
      <p> Philokalia of the Niptic Fathers', i.e. of the fathers who practised and inculcated the virtue of watchfulness. This shows how central is the role assigned by St Nikodimos to this state. WRATH, wrathfulness: see Appetitive aspect of the soul.</p>
