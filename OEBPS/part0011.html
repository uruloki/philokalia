      <p> 20.  You who sacrifice God's flesh and share in it through holy communion should also be united to Him by dying the death that He died (cf Rom. 6:5). As St Paul says (cf Gal. 2:20), you should live, not for yourself, but for Him who was crucified and died on your behalf. If, dominated by passion, you live for the flesh and the world, prepare yourself for deathless punishment through death unless you resign of your own accord from your priesthood before you die. But many unworthy priests have been snatched away by sudden death and sent to the halls of judgment.</p>
      <p> 21.   There was once a monk-priest who had a reputation for piety and was held in honor by many on account of his outward behavior, though within he was licentious and defiled. One day he was celebrating the Divine Liturgy and, on reaching the cherubic hymn, he had bent his head as usual before the holy table and was reading the prayer, 'No one is worthy...', when he suddenly died, his. soul having left him in that position.</p>
      <p> 22.   Nothing is more important than true intelligence and spiritual knowledge, for they produce both fear of God and longing for Him. Fear of God purifies us through awe and self-abasement. Longing for Him brings us: to perfection through discrimination and inward illumination, raising our intellect to: the heights of contemplation. Without, fear we cannot not acquire intense love for the divine, and so cannot spread our wings and find our resting-place in the realm of our aspiration.</p>
      <p> 23.   Be persuaded by me, you who ardently and in all seriousness long for salvations make haste, search persistently, ask ceaselessly.</p>
      <p> St Theognostos On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> knock patiently, and continue until you reach your goal. Establish a basis of firm faith and humility. You will have achieved what you want not simply when your sins are forgiven but when, fearlessly and joyously separated from the flesh, you are no longer excited or scared by the eruption of any passion.</p>
      <p> 24.  Ask with many tears to be given the full assurance of salvation, but - if you are humble - do not ask to be given it long before your death, in case you grow negligent and indifferent. Ask that you may obtain it when you are close to your departure - but make your request in all seriousness, lest out of presumption you should delude yourself into believing that you possess such assurance only to End, when the time comes, that you have failed to attain it. Where will you go then, unhappy man, deprived of the foretaste and unquestionable assurance of salvation given by the Spirit?</p>
      <p> 25.  If you aspire to the dispassion that deifies, find it first of all through obedience and humility, lest by traveling along some other path you end up in trouble. The person who has attained dispassion is not sometimes disturbed by the passions and at other times calm and at rest, but enjoys dispassion continually and, even when the passions are still present within him, he remains unaffected by the things that provoke them. Above all he is not affected by the images which the passions generate.</p>
      <p> 26.  When the soul lea\'es the body, the enemy advances to attack it, fiercely reviling it and accusing it of its sins in a harsh and terrifying manner. The devout soul, however, even though in the past it has often been wounded by sin, is not frightened by thte enemy's attacks and threats. Strengthened by the Lord, winged by joy, filled with courage by the holy angels that guide it, and encircled and protected by the light of faith, it answers the enemy with great boldness: 'Fugitive from heaven, wicked slave, what have I to do with you? You have no authority over me: Christ the Son of God has authority over me and over all things. Against Him have I sinned, before Him shall I stand on trial, having His Precious Cross as a sure pledge of His saving love towards me. Flee from me, destroyer! You have nothing to do with the servants of Christ.' When the soul says all this fearlessly, the devil turns his back, howling aloud and unable to with stand the name of Christ. Then the soul swoops down on the devil from above, attacking him like a hawk attacking a crow. After this it is brought rejoicing by the holy</p>
      <p> [V2] 365</p>
      <p> St Theognostos On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> angels to the place appointed for it in accordance with its inward state.</p>
      <p> 27.  The longing for transient things will not drag you earth-wards if you keep your mind on the things of heaven; but when you are shackled by an attachment to earthly things you are like an eagle caught in a trap by its claw</p>
      <p> and prevented from flying. Regard all you possess as trash, in the hope of better things. Shake off even your body when the time comes, and follow the angel of God that takes you from it.</p>
      <p> 28.  Just as a coin that does not bear the image of the king cannot be placed in the royal treasuries with the other currency, so without true spiritual knowledge and dispassion you cannot receive a foretaste of divine blessedness and depart with courage and confidence from this world to take your place among the elect m the next. By spiritual knowledge, I do not mean wisdom, but that unerring apperception of God and of divine realities through which the devout, no longer dragged down by the passions, are raised to a divine state by the grace of the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 29.  Even though you have successfully practiced all the virtues, do not assume that you have attained dispassion and can dwell in the world without anxiety; for your soul may still bear within it the imprint of the passions, and so you will have difficulties when you die. But, guided always by fear, keep careful watch over your mutable and ever-changing nature and shun the causes of passion. For changeless dispassion in its highest form is found only in those who have attained perfect love, have been lifted above sensory things through unceasing contemplation, and have transcended the body through humility. The flame of the passions no longer touches them: it has been cut off by the voice of the Lord (cf. Ps. 29:7), since the nature of such people has already been transmuted into incorruptibility.</p>
      <p> 30.  Do not try to attain dispassion prematurely and you will not suffer what Adam suffered when he ate too soon from the tree of spiritual knowledge (cf. Gen. 3:6). But patiently labor on, with constant entreaty and self-control in all things; and if by means of self-reproach and the utmost humility you keep the ground you have won, you will then in good time receive the grace of dispassion. The</p>
      <p> [V2] 366</p>
      <p> St Theognostos On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> harbor of rest is reached only after many storms and struggles; and God is not being unjust to those walking on the true path if He keeps the gate of dispassion closed until the right moment comes.</p>
      <p> 31.   Slothful and inexperienced as you are, you too should "go to the ant" (Prov. 6:6): imitate its simplicity and insignificance, and know that God, self-sufficient and superabundant, has no need of our virtues. On the contrary. He richly bestows His gifts on us and through His grace saves those who are consciously grateful, though in His compassion He also accepts whatever work we are able to do. If, then, you labor as one in debt to God for blessings already received, you do well and God's mercy is close to you. But if you think that God is in your debt because of the good things you imagine you have done, you are quite deluded. For how can the bestower of gifts be the debtor? Work like a hired servant and, advancing step by step, you will by God's mercy attain what you seek.</p>
      <p> 32.  Shall I show you another path to salvation - or, rather, to dispassion? Through your entreaties constrain .the Creator not to let you fail in your purpose. Constantly bring before Him as intercessors all the angelic powers, all the saints, and especially the most pure Mother of God. Do not ask for dispassion, for you are unworthy of</p>
      <p> such a gift: but ask persistently for salvation and with it you will receive dispassion as well. The one is like silver, the other like pure gold. In particular, let inward meditation on God be your handmaid, and turn your whole attention to the secret mysteries concerning Him: for the principles of these mysteries will deify you, and God delights in them and is won over by them.</p>
      <p> 33.  Strive to receive a sure, unequivocal pledge of salvation in your heart, so that at the time of your death you will not be distraught and unexpectedly terrified. You have received such a pledge when your heart no longer reproaches you for your failings and your conscience stops chiding you because of your fits of anger: when through God's grace your bestial passions have been tamed: when you weep tears of solace and your intellect prays undistracted and with purity: and when you await death, which most people dread and run away from, calmly and with a ready heart.</p>
      <p> 34.  The words of eternal life which, according to the chief of the apostles (cf John 6:68), God the Logos possesses, are the inner essences of all the things created by Him. Thus the person who, because of his purity, has been initiated into the mystery of these</p>
      <p> [V2] 367</p>
      <p> St Theognostos On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> inner essences has already acquired eternal life, a pledge of the Spirit and confident expectation of salvation. He who values the flesh more than the soul and is attached to Worldly things is not worthy of such gifts.</p>
      <p> 35.  An intelligent person is not merely someone who has the power of speech, for this is common to all men. On the contrary, he is someone who seeks for God with his intelligence. But he will never find the 'essence of Him who transcends all being, for this is beyond the scope of all created nature. But in much the same way as a builder is to be seen in his work, so the sovereign artificer is to be found and as it were perceived in the creative wisdom inherent in living things, and in His providential care, governance, unification, guidance and conservation of them.</p>
      <p> 36.   You cannot achieve a condition of total poverty without dis-passion, or dispassion without love, or love without the fear of God and pure prayer, or fear of God and pure prayer without faith and detachment: for it is when winged by faith and detachment that the intellect discards all base concern and soars upwards in search of its Lord.</p>
      <p> 37.  Let chastity be as dear to you as the pupil of your eye, and then you will become a temple of God and His cherished dwelling place. For without self-restraint you cannot live with God. Chastity and self-restraint are bom of a longing for God combined with detachment and renunciation of the world: and they are conserved by humility, self-control, unbroken prayer, spiritual contemplation, freedom from anger and intense weeping. Without dispassion, however, you cannot achieve the beauty of discrimination.</p>
      <p> 38.  Let no one deceive you, brother: without holiness, as the apostle says, no one can see God (cf. Heb. 12:14). For the Lord, who is more than holy and beyond all purity, will not appear to an impure person. Just as he who</p>
      <p> loves father or mother, daughter or son (of. Matt. 10:37) more than the Lord is unworthy of Him, so is he who loves anything transient and material. Even more unworthy is the person who chooses foul and fetid sin to preference to love for the Lord: for God rejects whoever does not repudiate all filthmess: 'Corruption does not mherit mcorruption' (1 Cor. 15:50).</p>
      <p> 39.  You will not be worthy of divine love unless you possess spiritual knowledge, or of spiritual knowledge unless you possess faith. I do not mean faith of a theoretical kind, but that which we</p>
      <p> [V2] 368</p>
      <p> St Theognostos On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> acquire as a result of practicing the virtues. You will achieve true compunction only when through self-control and vigil, prayer and humility, you have withered the propensity to sensual pleasure congenital to the flesh and have been crucified with Christ (cf Gal. 2:19-20), no longer living the life of the passions but living and walking in the Spirit, filled with the hope of heavenly glory.</p>
      <p> 40.  Cry out to God, " "I know that Thou favourest me, because my enemy does not exult over me" (Ps. 41:11): he will not domineer over me and plague me to the very end through the passions. But Thou wilt snatch me from his hands before I die and, granting me life in the Spirit according to Thy will, through a holy death Thou wilt bring me, saved, before Thy judgment seat. There, through Thy mercy, I shall receive the pledge of salvation and the assurance that is beyond all doubting. Thus I shall not be troubled and unprepared at the time of my departure from the world, nor shall I find the ordeal unbearable, more harsh and baleful than a death sentence or torture."</p>
      <p> 41.  Faith and hope are not merely casual or theoretical matters. Faith requires a steadfast soul, while hope needs a firm will and an honest heart. How without grace can one readily believe in things unseen? How can a man have hope concerning the hidden things held in store unless through his own integrity he has gained some experience of the Lord's gifts? These gifts of grace are a gage of the blessings held in store, which they manifest as present realities. Faith and hope, then, require both virtue on our part and God's inspiration and help. Unless both are present we labor in vain.</p>
      <p> 42.  The offspring of true virtue is either spiritual knowledge or dispassion or both together. If we fail to acquire them then we labor in vain, and our apparent virtue is not genuine; for if it were it would have produced fruit as well as leaves. In reality, however, it does not enjoy. God's blessing but is false, a matter of self-satisfaction, or else something feigned in order to gain the esteem of others or from some other motive not in accordance with God's will. But if we correct our motive, we shall undoubtedly receive the grace of God that bestows both spiritual knowledge and dispassion at the time and in the measure appropriate.</p>
      <p> 43.  Discern the wiles of the enemy with the light of grace and, throwing yourself before God with tears, confess your weakness.</p>
      <p> St Theognostos On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> counting yourself nothing, even though the deceiver tries to persuade you to think otherwise. Do not even ask for spiritual gifts unless they contribute to your salvation and help you to remain humble. Seek the knowledge that does not make you conceited, but leads you to the knowledge of God. Pray to be released from the tyranny of the passions before you die, and to depart this life in a state of dispassion or - more humbly - of compassion for the sins of others.</p>
      <p> 44.  Just as it is impossible to fly without wings, so we cannot attain the blessings for which we hope without already in this life receiving an assurance that is beyond doubt. Because of their extreme humility, or through the grace of the Holy Spirit, such assurance is given to those who have been reconciled with God, and who possess a dispassion that is less or more perfect in proportion to the degree of their reconciliation and purification. Those who depart from the body before receiving this assurance die while still in the winter of the passions, or else on the Sabbath (cf. Matt. 24:20) - refraining, that is to say, from the work of the virtues - and they are subject to trial and judgment, being culpable at the time of retribution.</p>
      <p> 45.  Since salvation comes to you as a free gift, give thanks to God your savior. If you wish to present Him with gifts, gratefully offer from your widowed soul two tiny coins, humility and love, and God will accept these in the treasury of His salvation more gladly than the host of virtues deposited there by others (cf. Mark 12:41-43). Dead through the passions, pray like Lazarus to be brought to life again, sending to God these two sisters to intercede with Him (cf. John 11:20-44): and you will surely attain your goal.</p>
      <p> 46.  The practice of the virtues does not by itself bring you to the dispassion that enables you to pray undistracted and in purity: spiritual contemplation must also in its turn confer on your intellect illuminative knowledge and the understanding of created beings. Thus winged and enlightened, the intellect is totally rapt by the love of true prayer and raised up to the cognate light of the incorporeal orders; thence, in so far as this is possible, it is borne towards the ultimate light, the triple sun of the Trinity supremely divine.</p>
      <p> 47.   We will not be punished or condemned in the age to be because we have sinned, since we were given a mutable and unstable nature. But we will be punished if, after sinning, we did not repent</p>
      <p> [V2] 370</p>
      <p> St Theognostos On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> and turn from our evil ways to the Lord; for we have been given the power to repent, as well as the time in which to do so. Only through repentance shall we receive God's mercy, and not its opposite. His passionate anger. Not that God is angry with us; He is angry with evil. Indeed, the divine is beyond passion and vengefulness, though we speak of it as reflecting, like a mirror, our actions and dispositions, giving to each of us whatever we deserve.</p>
      <p> 48.  When you fall from a higher state, do not become panic-stricken, but through remorse, grief, rigorous self-reproach and, above all, through copious tears shed in a contrite spirit, correct yourself and return quickly to your former condition. Rising up again after your fall, you will enter the joyous valley of salvation, taking care so far as is possible not to anger your Judge again, so as not to need atoning tears and sorrow in the future. But if you show no such repentance in this present life, you will certainly be punished in the age to be.</p>
      <p> 49.   Let us return to the subject of the priesthood. As an. angelic order it requires of us an angelic purification, and a degree of discretion and self-restraint greater than in our previous life. What is defiled can m some measure become pure; it is far worse for the pure to become defiled. If we mix darkness with light, foul odors with sweet, we shall inherit calamity and destruction because of our sacrilege, like Ananias and Sapphira (cf Acts 5:1-10).</p>
      <p> 50.  If, lost and useless though you are, you decide after superficial purification to enter the heavenly, angelic order of the priesthood and to become a chosen vessel, suitable for the Lord's use, as St Paul says (cf. 2 Tim. 2:21; Acts 9:15), then you should keep unsullied the office of which you have been found worthy, guarding the divine gift as you would the pupil of your eye. Otherwise, fulfilling your role in a perfunctory manner, you will be cast down from the heights into the abyss and find it hard to climb out again.</p>
      <p> 51.  Wisely bear in mind that, if God acquits, no one can condemn (cf. Rom. 8:33-34). If you have been called to enter into the supramundane grace of the priesthood, do not worry about your past life, even if to some- extent it has been soiled: for it has been purified once more by God and through your own self-correction. But afterwards be diligent and watchful, so as not to eclipse the grace. Then if someone stupidly casts aspersions on your priesthood be</p>
      <p> [V2]371</p>
      <p> St Theognostos On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> cause of your past, he will hear a voice from heaven saying, 'What God has cleansed, do not call unclean' (Acts 10:15).</p>
      <p> 52.   The office of the priesthood is light and its yoke easy (cf Matt. 11:30) so long as it is discharged as it should be, and so long as the grace of the Holy Spirit is not put up for sale. When what is beyond price is bartered in the name of human expedience and for perishable gifts, and when the call is not from above, the burden is heavy indeed; for it is borne by someone unworthy, whose powers it exceeds. The yoke is then extremely harsh, chafing the neck of him who carries it and sapping his strength; and unless it is taken from him, it will exhaust and destroy him utterly.</p>
      <p> 53.   When you boldly take up the yoke of the priesthood, you should mend your ways and expound the truth rightly, thus working out your salvation with fear and trembling; "for our God is a consuming fire" (Heb. 12:29). If you are as gold and silver and you touch this fire, have no fear of being burnt, just as the three children in Babylon had no fear (cf. Dan. 3:17). But if you are like grass or reeds or some other easily combustible material as a result of your earthly thoughts, then tremble lest you should be reduced to ashes in the heavenly fire - unless</p>
      <p> like Lot (cf. Gen. 19:17, 29) you escape God's wrath by quitting the priesthood. Yet it may be that some of the lighter faults that result from weaknesses are consumed by this divine fire during the celebration of the Liturgy, while you yourself remain unbumed and unharmed in the fire, like the fragile bush in the desert (cf Exod. 3:2).</p>
      <p> 54.  If like someone with, gonorrhea you lack the strength to break with your impassioned state because it has become chronic, how can you dare, wretched as you are, to touch what even to angels is untouchable? Ether shudder with awe and renounce the sacred ministry, in this way propitiating God; or else, obdurate and incorrigible, expect to fall into the hands of the living God and to experience His wrath. God will not spare you out of compassion, but will punish you mercilessly for daring to come to the royal wedding feast with both soul and garment denied, unworthy even of entry, much less of joining in the celebration (cf. Matt. 22 : 12).</p>
      <p> 55.  I myself have known a priest who dared to celebrate the divine mysteries unworthily, having succumbed to the passion of unchastity. First he fell victim to a dreadful, incurable disease and was near death. Then, after unavailingly doing everything he could</p>
      <p> [V2] 372</p>
      <p> St Theognostos On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> to rid himself of this disease - in fact it got even worse - he began to realize that he was dying because he had celebrated the mysteries unworthily. Straight away he took a vow to desist from celebrating, and recovered at once, so that not even a trace of his illness remained.</p>
      <p> 56.  The priestly dignity, like the priestly vestments, is full of splendor, but only so long as it is illumined from within by purity of soul. Once it has been disgraced through lack of attentiveness, and no notice is taken of the protests of the conscience, then the light becomes darkness, the harbinger of eternal darkness and eternal fire. Our only recourse to such a case is to leave this precipitous path, and to take the road that leads safely, by way of virtue and humility, to the kingdom of God.</p>
      <p> 57.  Salvation is attained through simplicity and virtue, not through the glories of the priesthood, which demands of us an angelic way of life. Either, then, you should become dispassionate like the angels, in thought and purpose superior to the world and the flesh, climbing the ladder to heaven m this way; or else, aware of your weakness, you should in fear avoid the high rank of the priestliood, terrified of the great fall should you prove unworthy of it. Choose the form of life followed by the laity, for it brings one no less close to God than priesthood. Moreover, should you fall while pursuing it, through God's mercy and grace you will easily rise again by repenting.</p>
      <p> 58.  'Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God' (1 Cor. 15:50). How is it, then, that you who partake of God's flesh and blood, do not become one body with Him and commingle with Him through His blood? Although the kingdom of heaven is within you, are you still besieged by the passions of your own flesh and blood? I fear that the Spirit of God will not remain within you in your non-Spiritual state, and that on the day of judgment you will be sentenced with the utmost severity: the priesthood will be taken from you because of your unworthiness of such grace, and you will be sent to eternal punishment.</p>
      <p> 59. If there is no fear of God before your eyes, you will think it a trivial matter to officiate unworthily, for you will be deceived by your own self-love into imagining that God will be charitable to you. Long ago Dathan and Abiram imagined the same thing until the earth opened beneath them and swallowed them up (cf Num. 16:25-33). Standing with genuine awe and fear before Him who is</p>
      <p> [V2]373</p>
      <p> St Theognostos On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> to be feared, recognize how grave a matter it is to officiate, and either engage in the priestliood worthily and purely -as it were like an angel - or wisely keep away from the dread ministry. Otherwise, slighting your office, and using specious arguments against your conscience when it rebukes you, you will say in your agony as you are condemned on the day that all things are judged and set aright: 'The fear that I feared has come upon me, and what I dreaded has visited me" (Job 3:25).</p>
      <p> 60.  Watchfully and sedulously you should offer, with contrition and tears, the world-saving and holy sacrifice first of all in propitiation for your own sins. Who after your death will offer it on your behalf with such concern? Anticipate wisely, therefore: bury yourself and commemorate yourself in advance. Offer the holy gifts to God on the holy table as the means of your salvation, making present the voluntary death He suffered in His love for man.</p>
      <p> 61.  Inexpressible is the soul's delight when in full assurance of salvation it leaves the body, stripping it off as though it were a garment. Because it is now attaining what it hopes for, it puts off the body painlessly, going in peace to meet the radiant and joyful angel that comes down for it, and traveling with him unimpeded through the air, totally unharmed by the evil spirits. Rising with joy, courage and thanksgiving, it comes in adoration before the Creator, and is allotted its place among those akin to it and equal to it in virtue, until the universal resurrection.</p>
      <p> 62.  I shall tell you something strange, but do not be surprised by it. Should you fail to attain dispassion because of the predispositions dominating you, but at the time of your death be in the depths of humility, you will be exalted above the clouds no less than the man who is dispassionate. For even if the treasure of those who are dispassionate consists of every virtue, the precious stone of humility is more valuable than them all: it brings about not only propitiation with the Creator, but also entry with the elect into the bridal chamber of His kingdom.</p>
      <p> 63.  Having received from God a propitiation for your offences, glorify Him who is long-suffering and forgiving, and make every effort to avoid deliberate sin. For though your sins may be forgiven daily until your death, it would be foolish of you to sin glibly with full knowledge of what you are doing. None the less, if you drive off the dog of despair with the stone of hopefulness and supplicate</p>
      <p> St Theognostos On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> boldly and insistently, your many sins will be forgiven you. Then, in the age to be, as a debtor you too will love the God who is beyond all goodness and yet has compassion for you.</p>
      <p> 64.  When, energized by divine grace, you find yourself full of tears in prayer before God, lie on the ground stretched out in the form of a, cross, beat the earth with your brow and ask for deliverance from this life as a release from corruption and a liberation from trials and temptations. But ask that this may be granted, not as you wish, but as and when God wills. For your part, you should long for your departure now, hoping that, if you come before God with, tears and in the depths of humility, you will stand firm and confident in the fire of your desire and your prayer; but you should also be ready for your death to be delayed for the time being, should God foresee something better for you. Pursue your goal forcefully, dedicating your whole life to God, in all your actions, words and intentions seeking by all possible means not to fall away from Him.</p>
      <p> 65.  While still in the flesh, do not try to plumb the inner depths of intelligible realities even if the noetic power of your soul is drawn towards them by its purity. For unless the bodiless part of man, now mingled with breath and blood, is released from the grossness of materiality and enters the realm of the intelligible realities, it cannot grasp these realities properly. You should therefore prepare yourself to issue from this material world as though from some dark second maternal womb, and to enter that immaterial and radiant realm, joyfully glorifying our Benefactor who carries us through death towards the fulfillment of our hopes. Be watchful at all times because of the ungodly demons that surround us, always plotting to disgrace jus and craftily watching for our heel (cf. Gen. 3:15), that is, for the end of our life, in order to trip us up. Until your death, therefore, go in fear and trembling because of the uncertainty of what is to come; for, endowed as you are with free will, you have been created with a .mutable and fluctuating nature.</p>
      <p> 66.  The enemy attacks us with fierce and terrible temptations when he perceives that our soul aspires to scale great heights of virtue. This we learn from the words of the Lord's Prayer and from our own attempts to ascend beyond the material duality of our flesh and sensory things. The hater of mankind tries us with such malice that we despair even of life. Of course, in his futility, he does not</p>
      <p> [V2]375</p>

      <p> realize that he confers many blessings on us, testing our endurance and weaving for us more splendid garlands.</p>
      <p> 67. No struggle is greater than the struggle for self-restraint and virginity. He who honors celibacy is admired even; by the angels and is crowned just as athletes are. If, bound to flesh and blood, he strives to imitate through chastity the immaterial nature of the angels, terrible Is the battle he has to fight; and if he is successful, so great</p>
      <p> is his achievement that it appears virtually impossible and beyond our nature. Indeed, it would be impossible if God did not help us from above, supporting the weakness of our nature, mending what is rotten, and somehow raising us from the ground through divine love and through hope for the gifts held in store for us.</p>
      <p> 68.  Flesh flabby from over-drinking and over-sleeping is a great obstacle to self-restraint. True self-restraint is unaffected even by the fantasies that arise during sleep. If the intellect pursues these fantasies, this indicates that it still bears deep within itself the sickness of the passions. But if through grace it is found worthy to commune with God outside the body during sleep, it remains unaffected by these fantasies and serves as a vigilant guardian of soul and body, both of which are at peace. The intellect is then like a sheep-dog that keeps watch against the cunning wolves, not letting them ravage the flock.</p>
      <p> 69.  Once more, I shall tell you something strange at which you are not to be startled. A mystery is accomplished secretly between the soul and God in the higher reaches of perfect purity, love and faith. When a man is completely reconciled to God he is united with Him through unceasing prayer and contemplation. Such was Elijah's state when he closed the heavens, causing a drought (cf. 1 Kgs. 17:1), and burnt the sacrifice with fire from heaven (cf. 1 Kgs. 18:36-38). In such a state Moses divided the sea (cf. Exod. 14:21) and defeated Amalek by stretching out his arms (cf. Exod. 17:11-13). In such a state Jonah was saved from the whale and from the deep (cf. Jonah 2:1-10). For the person found worthy of this mystery compels our most compassionate God to do whatever he wants. Even when still in the flesh, he has passed beyond the limits of corruption and mortality, and he aw aits death as if it were an everyday sleep that pleasurably brings him to the fulfillment of his hopes.</p>
      <p> 70.  Be full of reverence for our Lord's sufferings, for the</p>
      <p> [V2] 376</p>
      <p> St Theognostos On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> self-emptying of the divine Logos for our sake and, above all, for the sacrifice of the divine, life-creating body and blood and their interfusion with us. For we have been found worthy not only to participate in them but also to officiate at the sacrifice. Humble yourself like a sheep for the slaughter, truly regarding all men as your superiors, and strive not to wound Ac conscience of any man, especially without reason. Do not dare to touch the holy gifts un-purified, lest you should be burnt like grass by the divine fire and destroyed like melting wax.</p>
      <p> 71.  If you celebrate the divine, revered and awesome mysteries in the proper manner, with absolutely nothing on your conscience, you may hope for salvation, for the benefit you derive from this will be greater than that which derives from any work or from contemplation. But if you cannot celebrate as you should, you will yourself realize that it is better to acknowledge your weakness and to withdraw from the priesthood than to fulfill your priestly ministry imperfectly and impurely, appearing exalted in the eyes of many but being in reality a corpse to be wept over because of your unworthiness.</p>
      <p> 72.  As the sun excels the stars so do the worship, propitiation and invocation of the priest excel all psalmody and prayer. For we priests sacrifice, set forth and offer in intercession the Only-Begotten Himself who in His freely-given compassion was slain on behalf of sinners. And, provided that our consciences are not polluted, we</p>
      <p> receive thereby not only remission of sins, but all the things for which we pray and which are for our benefit. What is united to the Divinity bums the brushwood of sin like coal and illumines the hearts of those who approach in faith. Similarly, the divine and precious blood cleanses and purifies more than any hyssop every stain and defilement m those who dare to receive it with all the purity and holiness of which they are capable.</p>
      <p> 73. As one of the saints has said, it is not the ascended body of God the Logos that comes down from heaven and is sacrificed; it is the bread and wine themselves that are changed into the body and blood of Christ through the rites celebrated with faith, fear, longing and reverence by those found worthy of the holy priesthood. And this interchange takes place through the action and presence of the</p>
      <p> [V2] 377</p>
      <p> St Theognostos On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> Holy Spirit. The bread and wine do not become a body other than that of our Lord, but are changed into His body, being then a source of immortality and no longer perishable. What therefore must be the purity and holmess required of the priest who touches the divine body? And what boldness must he not have as mediator between God and man, havmg as co-intercessors the most holy Mother of God, all the heavenly, angelic powers, and the saints from every age? Since he has an angelic, or even archangelic, office, in my view he needs to be like the angels and archangels.</p>
      <p> 74.  You should note, Pisinios, that the holy gifts awaiting consecration lie on the altar after the Creed uncovered because there has to be a kind of voiceless supplication to God on behalf of those offering them. Seeing them uncovered. He does not overlook or despise this supplication; for He keeps in mind His voluntary self-emptying for us sinners. His ineffable self-abasement and His compassionate death. He did not ransom and save us through His passion because we deserved it but, blessed and forbearing as He is. He had mercy on us and restored us in spite of our offences.</p>
      <p> 75.   Even though, through the practice of pure prayer that immaterially unites the immaterial intellect with God, you receive the pledge of the Spirit and see as in a mirror the blessedness that aw aits you after this present life, and even though you fully and consciously experience the kingdom of heaven within you, do not allow yourself to be released from the flesh without foreknowledge of your death. Pray persistently for this knowledge and be in good hope of receiving it when you are close to death, if this is for your profit. Prepare yourself constantly for death, casting aside all fear, so that, traversing the air and escaping the evil spirits, you may boldly enter the vaults of heaven. Ranked with the angelic orders and numbered among all the righteous and elect, you will then behold the Divinity, in so far as this is possible. You will perceive, that is to say, the blessings that come from Him, as well as the Logos of God shedding His light through the regions above the heavens, adored in His unsullied flesh, together with the Father and the Spirit, in a single act of worship by all the host of heaven and all the saints. Amen.</p>

      <p> (?9th-10th century) (Volume 3, pp. 15-31)</p>
      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> 'It is not clear', states St Nikodimos, 'at what date our holy father Philotheos flourished and died.' He is known to us solely as the author of the present work  Forty Texts on Watchfulness.  From his name it is evident that he was a monk of Mount Sinai, while the content of his  Forty Texts  shows that he followed in the tradition of St John Klimakos, abbot of Sinai (sixth-seventh century), whom he quotes (§20; cf §34). His spiritual teaching is also close to that of another Sinaite author, St Hesychios the Priest (?eighth-ninth century);' the three of them may be regarded as forming together a distinctively Sinaite 'school' of ascetic theology. Certainly later in date, then, than Klimakos, and probably likewise later than Hesychios, Philotheos may have lived in the ninth or tenth century.</p>
      <p> Clear and concise, the  Forty Texts  are especially valuable for the simple definitions that they give of key concepts. As the title indicates, St Philotheos assigns central significance to the quality of watchfulness or spiritual sobriety  (nipsis).  In common with St Hesychios, he sees this as closely connected with inner attentiveness and the guarding of the intellect: the three notions are virtually synonymous. But he underlines, more explicitly than does Hesychios, the importance of bodily asceticism and the keeping of the commandments; the inner and the outer warfare go together. Like the other two members of the Sinaite 'school', he commends the invocation of the Holy Name, 'the unceasing prayer of Jesus Christ' (§2), which has power to 'concentrate the scattered intellect' (§27), thereby enabling it to maintain continual mindfulness of God. Particularly striking is Philotheos' insistence upon the remembrance of death, which is to be viewed not as something morbid and 'world- denying', but rather as enhancing the unique value of each moment of time.</p>

      <p> Forty Texts on Watchfulness</p>
      <p> 1.  There is within us, on the noetic plane, a warfare tougher than that on the plane of the senses. The Spiritual worker has to press on with his intellect towards the goal (cf. Phil. 3:14), in order to enshrine perfectly the remembrance of God in his heart like some pearl or precious stone (cf. Matt. 13:44-46). He has to give up everything, including the body, and to disdain this present life, if he wishes to possess God alone in his heart. For the noetic vision of God, the divine Chrysostom has said, can by itself destroy the demonic spirits.</p>
      <p> 2.  When engaged in noetic warfare we should therefore do all we can to choose some spiritual practice from divine Scripture and apply it to our intellect like a healing ointment. From dawn we should stand bravely and unflinchingly at the gate of the heart, with true remembrance of God and unceasing prayer of Jesus Christ in the</p>
      <p> soul; and, keeping watch with the inteUect, we should slaughter all the sinners of the land (of. Ps. 101:8. LXX). Given over in the intensity of our ecstasy to the constant remembrance of God, we should for the Lord's sake cut off the heads of the tyrants (cf. Hab. 3:14. LXX), that is to say, should destroy hostile thoughts at their first appearance. For in noetic warfare, too, there is a certain divine practice and order. Thus we should force ourselves to act in this way until it is time for eating. After this, having thanked the Lord who solely by virtue of His compassion provides us with both spiritual and bodily food, we should devote ourselves to the remembrance of death and to meditation; on it. The following morning we should courageously resume the same sequence of tasks. Even if we act daily in this manner we will only just manage, with the Lord's help, to escape from the meshes of the noetic enemy. When this pattern of spiritual practice is firmly</p>
      <p> [V3] 17</p>
      <p> St Philotheos of Sinai Forty Texts on Watchfulness</p>
      <p> established in us, it gives birth to the triad faith, hope and love. Faith disposes us truly to fear God. Hope, transcending servile fear, binds us to the love of God, since 'hope does not disappoint' (Rom. 5:5), containing as it does the seed of that twofold love on which hang 'the law and the prophets' (Matt. 22:40). And 'love never fails' (1 Cor. 13:8), once it has become to him who shares in it the motive for fulfilling the divine law both in the present life and in the life to be.</p>
      <p> 3.  It is veiy rare to find people whose intelligence is in a state of stillness. Indeed, such a state is only to be found in those who through their whole manner of life strive to attract divine grace and blessing to themselves. If, then, we seek - by guarding our intellect and by inner watchfulness - to engage in the noetic work that is the true philosophy in Christ, we must begin by exercising self-control with regard to our food, eating and drinking as little as possible. Watchfulness may fittingly be called a path leading both to the kingdom within us and to that which is to be; while noetic work, which trains and purifies the intellect and changes it from an impassioned state to a state of dispassion, is like a window full of light through which God looks, revealing Himself to the intellect.</p>
      <p> 4.  Where humility is combined with the remembrance of God that is established through watchfulness and attention, and also with recurrent prayer inflexible in its resistance to the enemy, there is the place of God, the heaven of the heart in which because of God's presence no demonic army dares to make a stand.</p>
      <p> 5.  Nothing is more unsettling than talkativeness and more pernicious than an unbridled tongue, disruptive as it is of the soul's proper state. For the soul's chatter destroys what we build each day and scatters what we have laboriously gathered together. What is more disastrous than this 'uncontrollable evil' (Jas. 3:8)? The tongue has to be restrained, checked by force and muzzled, so to speak, and made to serve only what is needful. Who can describe all the damage that the tongue does to the soul?</p>
      <p> 6.  The first gate of entry to the noetic Jerusalem - that is, to attentiveness of the intellect - is the deliberate silencing of your tongue, even though the intellect itself may not yet be still. The second gate is balanced self-control in food and drink. The third, is ceaseless mindfulness of death, for this purifies intellect and body. Having once experienced the beauty of this mindfulness of death, I</p>
      <p> St Philotheos of Sinai</p>
      <p> Forty Texts on Watchfulness</p>
      <p> was so wounded and delighted by it - in Spirit, not through the eye - that 1 wanted to make it my life's companion, for 1 was enraptured by its loveliness and majesty, its humility and contrite joy, by how full of reflection it is, how apprehensive of the judgment to come, and how aware of life's anxieties. It makes life-giving, healing tears flow from our bodily eyes, while from our noetic eyes rises a fount of wisdom that delights the mmd. This daughter of Adam - this mindfulness of death -1 always longed, as 1 said, to have as my, companion, to sleep with, to talk with, and to enquire from her what will happen after the body has been discarded. But unclean forgetfulness, the devil's murky daughter, has frequently prevented this.</p>
      <p> 7.  It is by means of thoughts that the spirits of evil wage a secret war against the soul. For since the soul is invisible, these malicious powers naturally attack it invisibly. Both sides prepare their weapons, muster their forces, devise stratagems, clash in fearful battle, gain victories and suffer defeats. But this noetic warfare lacks one feature possessed by visible warfare: declaration of hostilities. Suddenly, with no warning, the enemy attacks the inmost heart, sets an ambush there, and kills the soul through sin. And for what purpose is this battle waged against us? To prevent us from doing God's will as we ask to do it when we pray 'Thy will be done'. This will is the commandments of God. If with the Lord's help through careful watchfulness you guard your intellect from error and observe the attacks of the demons and their snares woven of fantasy, you will see from experience that this is the case. For this reason the Lord, foreseeing the demons' intentions by His divine power, set Himself to defeat their purpose by laying down His commandments and by threatening those who break them.</p>
      <p> 8.  Once we have in some measure acquired the habit of self-control, and have learnt how to shun visible sins brought about through 'the five senses, we will then be able to guard the heart with Jesus, to receive His illumination within it, and by means of the intellect to taste His goodness with a certain ardent longing. For we have been commanded to purify the heart precisely so that, through dispelling the clouds of evil from it by continual attentiveness, we may perceive the sun of righteousness, Jesus, as though in clear sky; and so that the principles of His majesty may shine to some extent m the intellect. For these principles are revealed only to those who purify their minds.</p>
      <p> [V3] 19</p>
      <p> St Philotheos of Sinai Forty Texts on Watchfulness</p>
      <p> 9.  We ought to make ourselves each day such as we should be when we are to appear before God. For the. prophet Hosea says: 'Hold fast to mercy and judgment, and always draw close to your God' (Hos. 12:6. LXX). Again, Malachi, speaking in God's name, says: 'A son honors his father, and a servant his lord. If 1 am a father, where is the honor due to me? And if 1 am Lord, where is the fear? So says the Lord Almighty' (Mai. 1:6. LXX). And St Paul states: 'Let us cleanse ourselves from all pollution of the flesh and spirit' (2 Cor. 7:1). And again. Wisdom says: 'Guard your heart with all diligence, for on this depends the outcome of life' (Prov. 4:23). And our</p>
      <p> Lord Jesus Christ said: 'Cleanse first the inside of the cup, so that the outside may also be clean' (Matt. 23:26).</p>
      <p> 10.  Untimely talk sometimes provokes hatred in those who listen, sometimes - when they note the folly of our words - abuse and derision. Sometimes it denies our conscience, or else brings upon us God's condemnation and, worst of all, causes us to offend against the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p> 11.  If with the Lord's help you cleanse your heart and uproot sin - struggling for the knowledge that is more divine and seeing in your intellect things invisible to most people - you must not on this account be arrogant towards anyone. For an angel, being incorporeal, is more pure and full of spiritual knowledge than any other created thing; yet it was an angel who, in exalting himself, fell like lightning from heaven. Thus his pride was reckoned by God as impurity. But those who dig up gold are known to all.</p>
      <p> 12.  St Paul says: 'The person engaged in spiritual warfare exercises self-control in all things' (1 Cor. 9:25). For, bound as we are to this wretched flesh, which always 'desires in a way that opposes the Spirit' (Gal. 5:17), we cannot when sated with food stand firm against demonic principalities, against invisible and malevolent powers; 'for the kingdom of God is not food and drink' (Rom. 14:17), and 'the will of the flesh is hostile to God: for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can it be' (Rom. 8:7). It is clear that it cannot be because it is earthly, a compound of humors, blood and phlegm, and always gravitating downwards. Thus it is always attached to earthly things and relishes the corrupting pleasures of the present life. 'For the will of the flesh is death' (Rom. 8:6); and 'they that are in the flesh cannot conform to God's will' (Rom. 8:8).</p>
      <p> [V3] 20</p>
      <p> St Philotheos of Sinai Forty Texts on Watchfulness</p>
      <p> 13.  Guarding the intellect with the Lord's help requires much humility, first in relation to God and then in relation to men. We ought to do all we can to crush and humble the heart. To achieve this we should scrupulously remember our former life in the world, recalling and reviewing in detail all the sins we have committed since childhood (except carnal sins, for the remembrance of these is harmful). This not only induces humility but also engenders tears and moves us to give heartfelt thanks to God. Perpetual and vivid mindfulness of death has the same effect: it gives birth to grief accompanied by a certain sweetness and joy, and to watchfulness of intellect. In addition, the detailed remembrance of our Lord's Passion, the recollection of what He suffered, greatly humbles and abashes our pride, and this, too, produces tears. Finally, to recount and review all the blessings we have received from God is truly humbling. For our battle is against proud demons.</p>
      <p> 14.  Do not reject out of self-love these saving medicines of the soul. If you do, you are no disciple of Christ or imitator of St Paul. For St Paul says: T am not fit to be called an apostle' (1 Cor. 15:9); and again: 'I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent, insolent man' (1 Tim. 1:13). Do you see, proud man, how the saint was not forgetful of his former life? Indeed, all the saints, from the beginning of creation to the present day, have put on this lowliest holy cloak of God. Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, being God incomprehensible, unknown and ineffable, wishing to show us the way of eternal life and holiness, was clothed in humility during His whole life in the flesh. Thus holy humility ought truly to be called a divine virtue, a royal robe and commandment. Moreover, the angels and all the radiant and divine powers practice and preserve this virtue, knowing how Satan fell when he</p>
      <p> became proud, and how he hes in the abyss as a fearful warning of such a fall to both angels and men. Through his pride he proved himself in God's sight more degraded than any other created thing: We also know what fall Adam fell through pride.</p>
      <p> Since we have so many examples of this virtue that confers such blessings on the soul, let us follow them as fully as possible and humble ourselves in every way. Let us humble ourselves in soul and body, in thought and will, in words and ideas, in our outer bearing and our inner state. For unless we strive to do this we will</p>
      <p> [V3] 21</p>
      <p> St Philotheos of Sinai Forty Texts on Watchfulness</p>
      <p> turn our advocate, Jesus Christ, the Son of God and God, against us. For the Lord 'ranges himself against the proud, but gives grace to the humble' (Jas. 4:6); and: 'Everyone that is arrogant is unclean before the Lord' (Proy. 16:5. LXX): and: 'He who humbles himself will be exalted' (Matt. 23:12)' and: 'Learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart' (Matt. 11:29). So we must be careful.</p>
      <p> 15.  Our Savior says: 'Watch yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down by dissipation, drunkenness and worldly cares' (Luke 21:34); and St Paul says: 'The person engaged in spiritual warfare exercises self-control in all things' (1 Cor. 9:25). Aware of all that is said to us in divine Scripture, let us lead our life with self-control, especially in regard to food. Let us accustom our body to virtuous and orderly habits, nourishing it with moderation. For in this way the upsurges of the soul's desiring power are more easily calmed and subdued by its sovereign aspect, the intelligence; and in fact the same is true where the soul's mcensive power is concerned, as well as our other faults. For those with experience regard virtue as consisting in an all-inclusive self-control, that is, in the avoidance of every kind of evil. For the pre-eminent source of purity is God, the source and giver of all blessings; but next comes self-control with regard to food, exercised in the same regular manner each day.</p>
      <p> 16.  It is through us that Satan fights God, trying to nullify God's will, embodied as it is in the divine and life-giving commandments, by preventing us from carrying them out. Similarly, it is through us, and through the help which He gives us, that God seeks to accomplish His holy- will and so to defeat the devil's lethal purpose. In vain does the devil strive to oppose God by making men disobey the commandments; for God in His turn uses human weakness to overthrow the devil's schemes. And you can see that this is the case. For it is evident that all the commandments of the Gospel legislate for the tripartite soul and make it healthy through what they enjoin. They do not merely seem to make it healthy, but they actually have this effect. The devil, on the other hand, fights day and night against the tripartite soul. But if he fights against it, it is clear that he fights against Christ's commandments, since Christ legislates for the tripartite soul through the commandments. The three parts of</p>
      <p> [V3] 22</p>
      <p> St Philotheos of Sinai</p>
      <p> Forty Texts on Watchfulness</p>
      <p> the soul are represented by its incensive power, its desiring power and its intelligence.</p>
      <p> Note how Christ says, 'Whoever is angry with his brother without good cause will be brought to judgment' (Matt. 5:22), and then tells us how anger may be healed. But the enemy in his turn tries to subvert this commandment by stirring up strife and thoughts of rancor and envy within us. For he too knows that the intelligence should control the mcensive power; and so, by bombarding the intelligence with evil thoughts-with thoughts of envy, strife, contention, guile, self-esteem-he persuades the intelligence to abandon its control, to hand the reins over to the-incensive power, and to let the latter go unchecked. And the incensive power, having so to speak unseated its rider, disgorges through the mouth in the form of words all those things stored up in the heart as a result of the devil's wiles and the intellect's negligence. And the heart is then seen to be full, not of the divine Spirit and of godlike thoughts, but of evil. It is as the Lord said: 'The mouth expresses what fills the heart' (Matt. 12:34). For if the devil can induce the person he has taken possession of to utter what is harbored within, then that person will not merely call his brother 'dolt' or 'fool' but may well pass from insulting words to murder. It is in these ways that the devil fights against God and the commandment God gave about not being angry with one's brother without good cause. But the insulting words and their consequences could have been avoided had their initial provocations been expelled from the heart through prayer and attentiveness. Thus the devil achieves his purpose when he makes us break God's commandment by means of the thoughts that he insinuates into the heart.</p>
      <p> 17. What does the Lord command where the appetitive aspect or desiring power of the soul is concerned? 'Whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart' (Matt. 5:28). Aware of this injunction, the devil weaves a kind of mental net in order to undermine its effect. He does not attack us by exciting desire through an actual physical woman, but he operates inwardly by projecting into our intellect lascivious figures and images, and by insinuating words that rouse desire, and by other methods of this kind which those who have experience of the intellect know about.</p>
      <p> [V3] 23</p>
      <p> St Philotheos of Sinai Forty Texts on Watchfulness</p>
      <p> 18. What commandments are directed at the intelligence? 'I tell you, never swear an oath... but simply say "Yes" and "No"' (Matt. 5:34, 37); and: 'He who does not renounce everything and follow Me is not worthy of Me' (cf Matt. 10:37-38); and: 'Enter through the narrow gate' (Matt. 7:13). These are instructions to the intelligence. Again, the enemy - wanting to overpower the intelligence, a skilled commander - first addles its wits with gluttonous and promiscuous thoughts, treating it derisively and dismissing it from its command as though it were a drunken general; then he uses anger and desire as servants of his own will. Free in this way from the control of the intelligence, these powers-the desiring and the mcensive powers-use the five senses as aids in sinning openly. And these are the sins into which we then fall: our eyes become inquisitive, not having the intellect controlling them from within; our ears love to hear frivolous things; our sense of smell becomes effeminate and our tongue unbridled, and our hands touch what they ought not to touch. With this goes injustice instead of justice, folly instead of moral judgment, licentiousness instead of self-restraint, slavishness instead of courage. For these four principal virtues - justice, moral judgment, self-restraint and courage-govern the three aspects of the soul. When these aspects are properly guided, they keep the senses away from degrading things. Then the intellect, tranquil, its powers with God's help</p>
      <p> under control and tractable, fights the noetic battle readily and bravely. But if, being inattentive, it is defeated by the devil's provocations and its powers, are thrown into confusion, it breaks the divine commandments. Such violation, if not followed by the appropriate degree of repentance, will certainly lead to chastisement in the future. The intellect, consequently, should always be watchful. In this way it maintains its natural state and is a true guardian of the divine commandments.</p>
      <p> 19.   The soul is walled off, fenced in and bound with chains of darkness by the demonic spirits. Because of the surrounding darkness she cannot pray as she wants to, for she is fettered inwardly, and her inner eyes are blind. Only when she begins to pray to God, and to acquire watchfulness while praying, will she be freed from this darkness through prayer. Otherwise she will remain a prisoner. For through prayer the soul discovers that there</p>
      <p> [V3] 24</p>
      <p> St Philotheos of Sinai Forty Texts on Watchfulness</p>
      <p> is in the heart another fight and another hidden type of opposition, and a different kind of warfare against the thoughts provoked by the evil spirits. Holy Scripture bears witness to this when it says Tf the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, do not desert your place' (Eccles. 10:4). The place of the intellect is its firm stand in virtue and to watchfulness. For one can take a firm stand with respect to virtue and vice. Thus the psalmist says: 'Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, and has not stood in the path of sinners' (Ps. 1:1); and St Paul says: 'Stand, therefore, having girded your loins with truth' (Eph.6:14).</p>
      <p> 20.   With all our strength let us hold fast to Christ, for there are always those who struggle to deprive our soul of His presence; and let us take care lest Jesus withdraws because of the evil thoughts that crowd our soul (cf. John 5:13). Yet we will not manage to hold Him without great effort on the soul's part. Let us study His life in the flesh, so that in our own life we may be humble. Let us absorb His sufferings, so that by emulating Him we may endure our afflictions patiently. Let us savor His ineffable incarnation and His work of salvation on our behalf, so that from the sweet taste in our soul we may know that the Lord is bountiful (cf. Ps. 34:8). Also, and above all, let us unhesitatingly trust in Him and in what He says; and let us daily wait on His providence towards us. And whatever form it takes, let us accept it gratefully, gladly and eagerly, so that we may learn to look only to God, who governs all things in accordance with the divine principles of His wisdom. If we do all these things, we are not far from God; for godliness is 'perfection that is never complete', as one who was divinely inspired and-spiritually perfect has said.'</p>
      <p> 21.  He who really redeems his life, always dwelling on the thought and remembrance of death, and wisely withholding the intellect from the passions, is in a far better position to discern the continual presence of demonic provocations than the man who chooses to live without being mindful of death. The latter, by purifying the heart through spiritual knowledge alone, but not keeping in mind any thought of grief, may sometimes appear to control all the destructive passions by his skill; yet he is unwittingly fettered by</p>
      <p> [V3] 25</p>
      <p> St Philotheos of Sinai</p>
      <p> Forty Texts on Watchfulness</p>
      <p> one of them, the worst aU - pride, into which, abandoned by God, he sometimes falls. Such a person mast be very vigilant lest, deluded by conceit, he becomes deranged. For, as St Paul says (cf. 1 Cor. 4:6, 18, 19; 8:1), souls that gather knowledge from here and there tend to become .haughty and disdainful towards their inferiors, as they regard them; they lack the spark of the love which builds up. But he who all the day long is mindful of death discerns the assaults of the demons more keenly; and he counterattacks and repels them.</p>
      <p> 22.  The blessed remembrance of God - which is the very presence of Jesus - with a heart full of wrath and a saving animosity against the demons, dissolves all trickeries of thought, plots, argumentation, fantasies, obscure conjectures and, in short, everything with which the destroyer arms himself and which he insolently deploys in his attempt to swallow our souls. When Jesus is invoked. He promptly bums up everything. For our salvation lies in Christ Jesus alone. The Savior Himself made this clear when He said: 'Without Me you can do nothing' (John 15:5).</p>
      <p> 23.  At every hour and moment let us guard the heart with all diligence from thoughts that obscure the soul's mirror; for in that mirror Jesus Christ, the wisdom and power of God the Father (cf. 1 Cor. 1:24), is typified and luminously reflected. And let us unceasingly seek the kingdom of heaven inside our heart (cf. Luke 17:21), the seed (cf. Luke 13:19), the pearl (cf. Matt. 13: 45) and the leaven (cf. Matt. 13:33). Indeed, if we cleanse the eye of the intellect we will find all things hidden within us. This is why our Lord Jesus Christ said that the kingdom of heaven is within us, indicating that the Divinity dwells in our hearts.</p>
      <p> 24.  Watchfulness cleanses the conscience and makes it lucid. Thus cleansed, it immediately shines out like a light that has been uncovered, banishing much darkness. Once this darkness has been banished through constant and genuine watchfulness, the conscience then reveals things hidden from us. Through the intellect it teaches us how to fight the unseen war and the mental battle by means of watchfulness, how we must throw spears when engaged in single combat and strike with well-aimed lances of thought, and how the intellect must escape being hit and' avoid the noxious darkness by hiding itself in Christ, the tight for which it longs. He who has tasted this light will understand what I am talking about.</p>
      <p> [V3] 26</p>
      <p> St Philotheos of Sinai</p>
      <p> Forty Texts on Watchfulness</p>
      <p> The soul is never sated with it, but the more it feeds on it, the hungry it grows. It is a light that attracts the intellect as the sun the eye. Inexplicable, it yet becomes explicable through experience. This experience I have known or, more precisely, I have been wounded by it; but it commands me to be silent, even though my intellect would delight in speaking of it. 'Pursue peace with all men and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord' (Heb. 12:14). Do this in order to acquire love and purity, for these are peace and holiness.</p>
      <p> 25. You must direct your wrath only against the demons, for they wage war upon us through our thoughts and are full of anger against us. As regards the manner of the hourly warfare within us, listen and act accordingly. Combine prayer with inner watchfulness, for watchfulness purifies prayer, while prayer purifies watchfulness. It is through unceasing watchfulness that we can perceive what is entering into us and can to some extent close the door</p>
      <p> against it, calling upon our Lord Jesus Christ to repel our malevolent adversaries. Attentiveness obstructs the demons by rebutting them; and Jesus, when invoked, disperses them together with all their fantasies.</p>
      <p> 26.  Be extremely strict in guarding your intellect. When you perceive an evil thought, rebut it and immediately call upon Christ to defend you; and while you are still speaking, Jesus in His gentle love will say: 'Behold, I am by your side ready to help you.' When this whole detachment of the enemy has been put out of action through prayer, again turn your attention to your intellect. There you will see a succession of waves worse than before, with the soul swimming among them. But again, awakened by His disciple, Jesus as God will rebuke the winds of evil (cf. Matt. 8:23-27). Having found respite for an hour perhaps, or for a moment, glorify Him who has saved you, and meditate on death.</p>
      <p> 27.  Let us go forward with the heart completely attentive and the soul fully conscious. For if attentiveness and prayer are daily joined together, they become like Elijah's fire-bearing chariot (cf 2 Kgs. 2:11), raising us to heaven. What do I mean? A spiritual heaven, with sun, moon and stars, is formed in the blessed heart of one who has reached a state of watchfulness, or who strives to attain it; for such a heart, as a result of mystical contemplation and ascent, is enabled to contain within itself the uncontainable God. If,</p>
      <p> [V3] 27</p>
      <p> St Philotheos of Sinai Forty Texts on Watchfulness</p>
      <p> then, you aspire to holiness. Cry with God's help to invoke the Lord and wholeheartedly to turn words into actions. By restraining with a certain forcefulness the five senses through which the soul can be injured, you with certainly make the struggle within the heart lighter for the intellect. So, by means of certain ploys, keep out all external enemies, and with incorporeal. God-given weapons fight against the thoughts .which they produce inside you. Avert sensual pleasure through strenuous vigils, and be sparing in food and drink. Keep the body properly slim so that you reduce the burden of the heart's warfare, with full benefit to yourself. Chastise your soul with the thought of death, and through remembrance of Jesus Christ concentrate your scattered intellect. It is particularly at night that the intellect grows lucid in its radiant contemplation of God and of divine realities.</p>
      <p> 28.  We should not reject the practice of bodily asceticism; for as wheat comes from the earth, so from such practice grows spiritual joy and benediction. Nor should we try to evade our conscience when it speaks to us of things conducive to salvation that we ought to do, and constantly tells us what is right and what is our duty. This it does especially when purified through active, applied, and meticulous watchfulness of intellect; for then, owing to its pure state, the judgments of the conscience tend to be all-embracing, to the point, and indisputable. So it should not be evaded, since it tells us inwardly how to live in conformity to God's will, and by severely censuring the soul when the mind has been infected by sins, and by admonishing the erring heart to repent, it provides welcome counsel as to how our defective state can be cured.</p>
      <p> 29.  Smoke from wood kindling a fire troubles the eyes; but then the fire gives them light and gladdens them. Similarly, unceasing attentiveness is irksome; but when, invoked in prayer, Jesus draws near. He illumines the heart; for remembrance of Him confers on us spiritual enlightenment and the highest of all blessings.</p>
      <p> eat the dust and to creep on our bellies as he does (of. Gen. 3:14). This is why God says: 'I will put enmity between you and him' (of. Gen. 3:16). Hence we must always breathe God, so that we are</p>
      <p> [V3] 28</p>
      <p> St Philotheos of Sinai Forty Texts on Watchfulness</p>
      <p> never wounded by the devil's fiery darts (cf. Eph. 6:16). 'I shall protect him'. He says, 'because he has known My name' (Ps. 91:14. LXX); and: 'His salvation is near those who fear Him' (Ps. 85:9).</p>
      <p> 31.  St Paul, the 'chosen vessel' (Acts 9:15) who spoke In Christ' (2 Cor. 2:17), out of his great experience of invisible noetic warfare wrote to the Ephesians: 'We do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against demonic principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in the celestial regions' (Eph. 6:12). And the Apostle Peter says: 'Be watchful, be vigilant, because your adversary, the devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Stand against him, steadfast in faith' (1 Pet. 5:8). And our Lord Jesus Christ, speaking of the various attitudes of those who hear the words of the Gospel, says: 'Then comes the devil, and snatches the word out of their hearts' - that is to say, he steals it by inducing them to forget it - 'lest they should believe and be saved' (Luke 8:12). And again Paul says: 'For with the inward man I delight in the law of God; but I see another law ... warring against the law of my intellect, and bringing me into captivity' (Rom. 7:22-23). They said these things to instruct and enlighten us about what we fail to perceive.</p>
      <p> 32.  In the absence of self-reproach and humility, spiritual knowledge puffs us up, making us feel superior to others (cf. 1 Cor. 8:1). But if we are aware of our own weakness we will keep in mind Paul's words when he says: 'My brethren, it is not as though I had already grasped it or were already perfect... but forgetting what lies behind, and reaching forward to what lies in front, I pursue my purpose, aiming at the prize of the high calling of God' (Phil. 3:13-14). And again; 'I do not run aimlessly, nor do I box by beating the air with my fists. But I discipline my body harshly, and bring it into subjection; for I fear lest, after preaching to others, I myself should be cast away' (1 Cor. 9:26-27). Do you not see how humility is a road to holiness, and what humility the great. St Paul had? He said: 'Christ came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the worst' (1 Tim. 1:15). Should we not humble ourselves, then, because of the lowliness of our nature? For what is more lowly than day? And we must be mindful of God, since we have been created for this. But we must also practice</p>
      <p> [V3] 29</p>
      <p> St Philotheos of Sinai</p>
      <p> Forty Texts on Watchfulness</p>
      <p> self-control, so that with our Lord's help we may advance unhampered in the spiritual life.</p>
      <p> 33. The person who gives himself over to evil thoughts cannot keep his outer self free from sin; and if evil thoughts have not been uprooted from the heart, they are .bound to manifest themselves in evil actions. We look on things adulterously because the inner eye has become adulterous and darkened; and we want to hear about foul</p>
      <p> things because our soul's ears have listened to what the foul demons inside us have whispered to us. Consequently, with the Lord's help, we must cleanse ourselves -withm and without. We must guard our senses and free each of them from impassioned and sinful influences. And just as, ignorant and full of futility, we used to live in the world with intellect and senses enslaved to the deceit of sin, so now, having changed to the life according to God, we must dedicate intellect and senses to the service of the living and true God, and of God's justice and will.</p>
      <p> 34.  First there is provocation; then a coupling with the provocation; then assent to it; then captivity to it; then passion, grown habitual and continuous. This is how the holy fathers describe the stages through which the devil gets the better of us.</p>
      <p> 35.  Provocation, they say, is a thought still free from passion, or an image newly engendered in the heart and glimpsed by the intellect. Coupling is to commune with this thought or image, in either an impassioned or a dispassionate way. Assent is the pleasurable acceptance by the soul of the thing seen. Captivity is the forcible and enforced abduction of the heart, or persistent intercourse with the object, disrupting even our best state. Passion, in the strict sense, they define as that which lurks impassionably in the soul over a long period. Of these stages the first is sinless; the second, not altogether free from sin; the sinfulness of the third stage depends on our inner state; and the struggle itself brings us either punishment or crowns of victory.</p>
      <p> 36. Captivity is one thing at the time of prayer, another when we are not engaged in prayer. Passion, however, incontestably leads either to a corresponding repentance or to future chastisement. But the person who rebuffs the initial provocation, or who regards</p>
      <p> [V3] 30</p>
      <p> St Philotheos of Sinai Forty Texts on Watchfulness</p>
      <p> it dispassionately, has at one stroke cut off all the sinful stages that follow. Such, then, is the strategy employed by the evil demons in their war against both those who are monks and those who are not; and the issue is either defeat or victory, as we have said. The victors are rewarded with crowns; those who fall and do not repent are punished. So let us wage noetic war against the demons, lest we translate their evil purposes into sinful actions. Let us cut sin out of our heart, and we will find within us the kingdom of heaven (cf. Luke 17:21). Let us preserve our heart's purity and always be filled with deep compunction towards God through this best of undertakings.</p>
      <p> 37. Many monks are not aware how the demons deceive the intellect. Being naive and undeveloped, they tend to give all their attention to the practice of the virtues and do not bother about the intellect. They move through life, I fear, without having tasted purity of heart, and are totally ignorant of the darkness of the passions within. Such people, unaware of the battle about which Paul speaks (cf. Eph. 6:12) and not imbued with personal experience of true goodness, regard as lapses only those sins which are actually put into effect. They do not take into account the defeats and the victories that occur on the plane of thought, for these, bemg internal, cannot be seen by natural sight and are known only to God our judge, and to the conscience of the spiritual contestant. I take it that the scriptural words, 'They said, "Peace", but there was no peace' (Ezek. 13:10), apply to such people. The other brethren pray for them in their simplicity, and as best they can teach them to avoid the actual commission of sin. But for those who have a divine desire to cleanse the vision of the soul there is another form of activity in Christ and another mystery.</p>
      <p> 38. Vivid mindfulness of death embraces many virtues. It begets grief; it promotes the exercise of self-control in all things; it is a reminder of hell; it is the mother of prayer and tears; it induces guarding of the heart and detachment from material things; it is a source of attentiveness and discrimination. These in their turn produce the twofold fear of God. In addition, the purging of impassioned thoughts from the heart embraces many of the Lord's commandments. The harsh hour-by-hour struggle in which so many athletes of Christ are engaged has as its aim precisely this purging of the heart.</p>
      <p> [V3] 31</p>
      <p> St Philotheos of Sinai</p>
      <p> Forty Texts on Watchfulness</p>
      <p> 39.  An unexpected event or misfortune considerably disrupts the mind's attentiveness; and, by dislodging the intellect from its concentration on higher realities and from its noble state of virtue, it diverts it towards sinful quarrelsomeness and wrangling. The cause of this overthrow is assuredly our lack of attention to the enemy's attacks.</p>
      <p> 40.  None of the painful things that happen to us every day will injure or distress us once we perceive and continually meditate on their purpose. It is on account of this that St Paul says: 'I take delight in weakness, insults and hardships' (2 Cor. 12:10); and: 'AH who seek to live a holy life in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution' (2 Tim. 3:12). To Him be glory through all the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> Ilias the Presbyter</p>
      <p> {? Late 11th — early 12   century) (Volume 3, pp. 32-65)</p>
      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> 'Ilias the Presbyter and Ekdikos', as he is called in the manuscripts, was - so his designation suggests - a lawyer who subsequently entered the ranks of the clergy. The title  ekdikos  signifies a judge attached to the ecclesiastical court at the Great Church of the Holy Wisdom ('St Sophia') in Constantinople. Evidently Ilias resigned from this legal post, becoming in all probability a monk before his ordination to the priesthood. He seems to have lived around the end of the eleventh or the beginning of the twelfth century. It is possible, although not certain, that he knew the writings of St Symeon the New Theologian (949-1022), whose influence some have detected in what Ilias says about tears and the divine light. He cannot in any case be later than the twelfth century, since the earliest manuscript of his work dates from this time. He may be the same person as Ilias, Metropolitan of Crete in the early twelfth century, the author of commentaries on St Gregory of Nazianzos and St John Klimakos.'</p>
      <p> In the surviving manuscripts  A Gnomic Anthology  appears variously under the names of St John of Karpathos (?seventh century)," St Maximos the Confessor (580-662),^ and Ilias himself. Almost certainly the third of these attributions is correct. Although styled an 'anthology', the work is not in fact a collection of excerpts from other authors but is Ilias' own composition. It is divided into four sections, each preceded by a couplet in verse. (The</p>

      <p> continuous numbering for parts I-II, and likewise for parts III-IV, but there are in reality four parts, not two.) The poetic epigraphs provide a general indication of the contents of each section:</p>
      <p> Part I: moral teaching (fasting, ascetic effort, the vices and virtues, with special emphasis on humility).</p>
      <p> Part II: prayer.</p>
      <p> Part III: spiritual contemplation (with particular reference to 'natural contemplation' or the 'contemplation of nature', that is, knowledge of the inner essences or principles of created things - of what in III, 13 are termed 'the world's foundations').</p>
      <p> Part IV: the practice of the virtues  (praxis)  and contemplation  (theoria)  (taking up all the main themes mentioned</p>
      <p> in the earlier parts).</p>
      <p> llias delights in vivid imagery taken from the world of nature, and also employs the nuptial symbolism of the Song of Songs. Like St Maximos, he makes a clear distinction between 'thought', on the discursive and rational level, and 'intellection', understood as the non-discursive apprehension of spiritual truth (III, 1-5). Following Evagrios, he speaks about a vision of the innate 'luminosity' of the intellect (II, 82, 89); beyond this, there is the higher vision of the divine light, in which the body also shares (II, 104-6). Here the Gnomic  Anthology  points forward to the teaching of the fourteenth-century Hesychasts, especially St Gregory Palamas. Four times llias refers to  evchi monologistos,  'single-phrased prayer' (II, 94, 104; IV, 65, 75), a term that links him with the Sinaite 'school'. In St John Klimakos this expression, used with the additional word  lisoii,  'of Jesus', definitely signifies the Jesus Prayer,' and in our translation we have taken the view that llias means it in the same sense, although in the Greek he does not actually add the qualification 'of Jesus'.</p>
      <p> In making our English version we have compared the text in the Greek  Philokalia  with that found among the works of St Maximos (P.G. xc, 1401-61): the latter frequently, but by no means invariably, gives a better sense.</p>
      <p> Subtle and highly concentrated, the short paragraphs of the  Gnomic Anthology  disclose their true meaning only if read with unusually close attention. Few other authors have been able, in so short a space, to provide such a comprehensive guide to the spiritual way.</p>

      <p> Here you will find, if you truly search, Afiowing spring, a pure fount of moral teaching.</p>
      <p> 1.  No Christian believing rightly in God should ever be off his guard. He should always be on the look-out for temptation, so that when it comes he will not be surprised or disturbed, but will gladly endure the toil and affliction it causes, and so will understand what he is saying when he chants with the prophet: 'Prove me, 0 Lord, and try me' (Ps. 26:2. LXX). For the prophet did not say, 'Thy correction has destroyed me', but, 'it has upheld me to the end' (Ps. 18:35. LXX).</p>
      <p> 2.  The first step towards excellence is fear of God, the last is loving desire for Him.</p>
      <p> 3.  The first step towards perfection is spiritual knowledge put into practice and practice imbued with spiritual knowledge. For practice without such knowledge is of no value, and so is such knowledge when unaccompanied by practice.</p>
      <p> 4.  Practice where the body is concerned consists of fasting and vigil; where the mouth is concerned it consists of psalmody. But prayer is better than psalmody, and silence is more valuable than speech. In the case of the hands, practice is what they do uncomplainingly; and of the feet, it is what they do as soon as they are urged to do it.</p>
      <p> 5.  Where the soul is concerned, practice is self-control accompanied by simplicity, and simplicity animated by self-control.</p>
      <p> 6.  In the case of the intellect, practice is prayer in contemplation and contemplation in prayer.</p>
      <p> 7.  Mercy and truth precede all the other virtues. They in their turn produce humility and so discrimination; for, according to the fathers,</p>
      <p> [V3] 35</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Parti</p>
      <p> discrimination conies from humility. Without discrimination, neither practice nor spiritual knowledge can fulfill its purpose. For practice uncontrolled by such knowledge strays here and there aimlessly, like a calf; while knowledge that refuses to clothe itself in the honorable vesture of practice lacks nobility, however much it may pretend to possess it.</p>
      <p> 8.  A courageous soul acts correctly when it is master of both practice and contemplation, like a woman who keeps</p>
      <p> two lamps burning throughout her hfe. But a soul debilitated by sensual pleasure fails to do what it should.</p>
      <p> 9.  Suffering deliberately embraced cannot free the soul totally from sin unless the soul is also tried in the fire of suffering that comes unchosen. For the soul is like a sword: if it does not go 'through fire and water' (Ps. 66:12. LXX) - that is, through suffering deliberately embraced and suffering that comes unchosen - it cannot but be shattered by the blows of fortune.</p>
      <p> 10.  Trials and temptations subject to our volition are chiefly caused by health, wealth and reputation, and those beyond our control by sickness, material losses and slander. Some people are helped by these things, others are destroyed by them.</p>
      <p> 11.  Desire and distress subsist in the soul; sensual pleasure and pain in the body. Sensual pleasure gives rise to pain, and pain to sensual pleasure (for, wanting to escape the wearisome feeling of pain, we take refuge in sensual pleasure); while desire results in distress.</p>
      <p> 12.   The virtuous may appear to be bad, but essentially they are good; superficially the self-important and pleasure-loving may appear to be good, but basically they are evil.</p>
      <p> 13.  The person who hates evil commits it but seldom and then not intentionally. But the person attached to the causes of evil commits it frequently and deliberately.</p>
      <p> 14.  Those who deliberately refuse to repent sin continually; those who sin without meaning to not only repent with all their heart, but also do not often have cause to repent.</p>
      <p> 15.  Let your words combine insight and self-awareness, so that the peaceable divine Logos may not be ashamed to enshrine Himself in them because of their brashness and lack of restraint.</p>
      <p> 16.   A person may have sullied his soul with words even if he has not degraded it by actions; and he may still be impure in his</p>
      <p> [V3] 36</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Parti</p>
      <p> thoughts even if he watches over his words. For there are three different ways of sinning.</p>
      <p> 17.  You will not be able to perceive the face of virtue so long as you still look on vice with a feeling of pleasure. But vice will appear hateful to you when you hunger for the taste of virtue and avert your gaze from every form of evil.</p>
      <p> 18.  Demons wage war against the soul primarily through thoughts, not through things; for things fight against us in their own right. Hearing and sight are responsible for the warfare waged through things, habit and the demons for that waged through thoughts.</p>
      <p> 19.   The soul is liable to sin in three ways: in actions, in words, and in thoughts. We attain freedom from sin in six ways: by preserving the purity of the five senses and of the spoken word. Whoever succeeds in doing this is indeed perfect, capable also of keeping every aspect of the body under control.</p>
      <p> 20.  The soul's non-intelligent or passible aspect consists of the five senses and the faculty of speech. When in a state of dispassion, the faculty of speech is preserved fully integrated with the soul's passible aspect; but when in an impassioned state, it receives the evil influences that the passible aspect communicates to it.</p>
      <p> 21.  The body cannot be purified without fasting and vigil, the soul without mercy and truth, and the intellect without contemplation of God and communion with Him. These pairs constitute the principal virtues in these three aspects of the human person.</p>
      <p> 22.  When the soul moves in obedience to these virtues, her citadel - patient endurance - is not disturbed by temptations. 'You will gain possession of your souls through your patient endurance' (Luke 21:19), says the Logos. Otherwise the soul will be shaken by fits of cowardice, as an unwalled city is by a distant uproar.</p>
      <p> 23.   Not all those who are discreet in their words are also circumspect in their thought. Nor are all those who are circumspect in their thought also discreet where their external senses are concerned. For although all men are subject to the senses, not all pay them the same amount of tribute. In their artlessness, most men do not know the price the senses demand for what they supply.</p>
      <p> 24.  Although moral judgment is by nature indivisible, there are none the less different degrees of it One person may be given more of it, another less, so that practical virtue, having grown with the help of the principal virtues, may bring to fruition in each person the</p>

      <p> goodness of which he is capable. But most people fail to a greater or lesser degree to practice the virtues, and the degree of moral judgment granted to them varies accordingly.</p>
      <p> 25.  Few are circumspect with regard to what is according to nature, but many with regard to what is contrary to nature. For having expended out of fear all their intrinsic quota of circumspection on what is contrary to nature, they have little left to exercise with regard to what is according to nature. Indeed, they expend most of it on superfluous things and what is by nature worthless.</p>
      <p> 26.   A sense of the right moment and a sense of proportion go hand in hand with an intelligent silence. Truth is the banquet of all the three together. Where there is such a banquet, the father of lies, confronting a soul as it departs from this life, will not find in it any of the things he looks for.</p>
      <p> 27.  A truly merciful person is not one that deliberately gives away superfluous things, but one that forgives those who deprive him of what he needs.</p>
      <p> 28.   Some men through acts of charity acquire spiritual wealth by means of material wealth; others renounce their material wealth altogether on becoming aware of the spiritual wealth that is inexhaustible.</p>
      <p> 29.  Everyone likes to be rich in spiritual blessings, but it is grievous to be rich in such blessings and not to be allowed to enjoy them for long.</p>
      <p> from some hidden sickness. It can be healed from the outside through being pierced by reproof, and from within through the renewal of the intellect. Whoever, then, rejects such reproof, and shamelessly continues to lie on his bed in the sickroom of lethargy, is a fool.</p>
      <p> 31.   Do not be angry with a person who unwittingly operates on you like a surgeon. Look rather at the abomination he has removed and, blaming yourself, bless him because through God's grace he has been of such service to you.</p>
      <p> 32.  If you are concerned for your soul's health, do not despair of your sickness as though it were incurable; but apply to it the potent medicine of ascetic effort and you will get rid of it.</p>
      <p> 33.  Do not shun the person who opportunely berates you; but go to him and he will show you how much evil lies hidden from your</p>

      <p> consciousness. Once you have swallowed the bitter and nauseous draught, you will taste the sweet nourishment of health.</p>
      <p> 34.  The greater the pain that you feel, the more you should welcome the person whose reproof makes you feel it. For he is bringing about within you that total purification without which your intellect cannot attain the pure state of prayer.</p>
      <p> 35.  When you are reproved, you ought either to remain silent, or else gently to defend yourself to your accuser— not indeed in order to gain his approval, but to help him rise up in case he has stumbled by reproving you in ignorance.</p>
      <p> 36.  If someone is rightly offended with you, but you repent before he calls on you to do so, you lose nothing; but if you repent only after you have been asked to, you forfeit half the harvest. If you never cause estrangement by giving offence to others, you recover all the seed that you sowed; but if you always put the blame on yourself, you gain in addition more than you originally laid out.</p>
      <p> 37.   A haughty person is not aware of his faults, or a humble person of his good Qualities. An evil ignorance blinds the first, an ignorance pleasing to God blinds the second.</p>
      <p> 38.   As regards his good qualities, the proud man does not want to be compared with his equals; but as regards his failings, he is quite content to be compared with those worse than himself.</p>
      <p> 39.  Reproof strengthens the soul, whereas praise debilitates it and makes it even more sluggish in its spiritual struggle.</p>
      <p> 40.  The substance of wealth is gold; of virtue, humility. Just as he who lacks gold is poor, even though this may not be outwardly apparent, so the spiritual aspirant who lacks humility is not virtuous.</p>
      <p> 41.   Lacking gold, a merchant is not a merchant, even though he may be very skilful in trading; similarly, lacking humility, a spiritual aspirant will never possess the joys of virtue, however great the confidence he places in his own</p>
      <p> intelligence.</p>
      <p> 42.  The higher a man ascends in humility, the lower he appears in his own eyes; but if he lacks humility, the higher he appears. The humble man does not wish to be compared even with the most lowly, and is grieved when he is given first place at table (cf Luke 14:7-10).</p>
      <p> 43.  It is good for the spiritual aspirant to regard a task as beyond him, but to be in his actions superior to this diffidence. In this way he will both earn men's respect and in God's sight will be 'a worker who has no cause to be ashamed' (2 Tim. 2:25).</p>

      <p> 44.  He who is afraid of being cast out of the bridal chamber as an interloper (cf. Matt. 22:11-13) should either carry out all God's commandments, or else should strive to fulfill just one of them - humility.</p>
      <p> 45.   Combine simplicity with self-control, and unite truth with humility, and you will keep house with justice, at whose table every other virtue likes to gather.</p>
      <p> 46.   Truth without humility is blind. That is why it becomes contentious: it tries to support itself on something, and finds nothing except rancor.</p>
      <p> 47.  A good character testifies to the beauty of virtue, just as soundness of body bears witness to a peaceful soul.</p>
      <p> 48.  It is best not to go astray at all. Second best is not to hide your error through shame, or be shameless about it, but to humble yourself and, when reproved, to reprove yourself likewise, gladly accepting the punishment. If you do not do this, everything you offer to God is valueless.</p>
      <p> 49.  In addition to voluntary suffering, you must also accept that which comes against your will -1 mean slander, material losses and sickness. For if you do not accept these but rebel against them, you are like someone who wants to eat his bread only with honey, never with salt. Such a man does not always have pleasure as his companion, but always has nausea as his neighbor.</p>
      <p> 50.  He who washes his neighbor's garment with inspired words, or who sews it up by contributing to his needs, has the outward appearance of a servant, but is really a master. But when he acts in this way he must be careful to do so truly as a servant, lest by growing conceited he loses both his reward and his proper rank.</p>
      <p> 51.  Just as faith gives substance to the things for which we hope (cf. Heb. 11:1), so moral judgment gives substance to the soul and humility to virtue. And it is extraordinary how things perfect in themselves become imperfect when deprived of the qualities that should be associated with them.</p>
      <p> 52.  'The Lord will guard your going out and your coming in' (Ps. 121:8): that is. He will enable you by means of self-control to watch over the food you-take in and the words you give out. For the person who exercises self-control over food and speech escapes the desire that enters through the eyes, and calms the anger that issues from a disordered mind. The spiritual aspirant must exercise the greatest</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Parti</p>
      <p> care and exert himself in every way in relation to these two passions. By so doing he will strengthen his practice of the virtues and put his contemplation on a sound basis.</p>
      <p> 53.  Some are most careful about the food they take in but negligent about the words they give out. To adapt Ecclesiastes (11:10. LXX), such men do not know how to remove anger from the heart or desire from the flesh. Only through the removal of these things is a pure heart established within us by the renewing Spirit (cf Ps. 51:10).</p>
      <p> 54.  You can achieve frugality by lowering the quantity of your food, and smlessness in speech by raising the quality of your silence.</p>
      <p> 55.  Sear your loins by abstaining from food, and prove your heart by controlling your speech, and you will succeed in bringing the desiring and mcensive powers of your soul into the service of what is noble and good.</p>
      <p> 56.  Sexual desire diminishes in the spiritual aspirant once the body has passed its prime; but gluttony continues unless properly disciplined. You must try to prevent the disgrace of the effect by removing its cause; otherwise in the life to come you will be found lacking in the virtue of self-control and will be covered with shame.</p>
      <p> 57.  The ascetic has to know when and by means of what foods to treat the body as an enemy, when to encourage it as a friend, and when to succor it as an invalid. Otherwise he may unwittingly offer to the friend what is proper for the enemy, or to the enemy what is proper for the friend, and to the invalid what is proper for either of the other two; and having alienated all three he may find them fighting against him in time of temptation.</p>
      <p> 58.  If, when eating, the nourishment in your food is more important to you than its savor, then the grace of tears will be given to you and you will begin to find spiritual refreshment; and you will forget all other taste, relishing its sweetness beyond that of anything else.</p>
      <p> 59.   The tears of the man who scatters his energies dry up, but they gush forth in the man who keeps to the narrow path(cf Matt. 7:13-14).</p>
      <p> 60.  Neither the sinner nor the righteous man is free from remorse: the first, because he has not altogether abandoned evil; the second, because he has not yet attained perfection.</p>
      <p> 61.   Among the things that lie within our power are the virtues of prayer and silence; among the things that depend for the most part not on us, but on the constitution of the body, are fasting and vigil. Hence</p>

      <p> the spiritual aspirant must try to attain whatever is more accessible to him.</p>
      <p> 61. Patience is the house of the soul, for in it the soul is safeguarded. Humility is the soul's wealth, for the soul is nourished through it.</p>
      <p> 63.   If you do not bear criticism patiently, you will not be honored with praise. If before indulging in pleasure you reflect on the pain inherent in it, you will escape the distress to which it gives birth.</p>
      <p> 64.  Do not fetter yourself to a small thing and you will not be enslaved to a greater one. For the greater evil is built up only on the basis of the smaller.</p>
      <p> 63. By being mindful of greater evils, you will also be fearful of smaller ones; but if you give way to the greater evils, you will shamefully indulge in the lesser as well.</p>
      <p> 66.  You will not be able to attain the greater virtues until you have fully achieved those which lie within your power.</p>
      <p> 67.   In those in whom mercy and truth prevail, everything is godlike; for truth judges no one without mercy, while mercy never manifests compassion apart from truth.</p>
      <p> 68. Having united simplicity and self-control, you will experience the blessing which their union produces.</p>
      <p> 69.   You will not be able to cut down the passions attacking you unless you first leave unfilled the soil from which they are fed.</p>
      <p> 70.  Some try to purify only the matter of the body, others that of the soul as well. The first gain a certain control with regard to the actual committing of a sin, the second with regard to the passion behind it. But extremely few gain control over the underlying desire.</p>
      <p> 71.   Passionateness is the evil matter of the body; self-indulgence, that of the soul; impassioned craving, that of the intellect. Touch is responsible for the first; the rest of the senses for the second; and a perverse disposition for the third.</p>
      <p> 72.  The self-indulgent man is close to the impassioned man; and the man of impassioned craving to the self-indulgent man. Far from all three is the dispassionate man.</p>
      <p> 73.  The impassioned man is strongly prone to sin in thought, even though for the time being he does not sin outwardly. The self-indulgent man actually commits the sin suggested in thought, even though he suffers inwardly. The man of impassioned craving is given over freely or, rather, servilely, to .the various modes of sinning. The</p>

      <p> dispassionate man is not dominated by any of these degrees of passion. 74. Passionateness is removed from the soul through fasting and prayer, self-indulgence through vigil and silence;</p>
      <p> and impassioned craving through stillness and attentiveness. Dispassion is established through remembrance of God.</p>
      <p> 75.  Words of eternal life drop from the lips of dispassion like honey from the honeycomb (cf. Song of Songs 4:11). Who then is worthy of touching her lip with his own, of lying between her breasts (cf. Song of Songs 1:13), and smelling the fragrance of her clothes (cf. Song of Songs 4:10, 11) - that is to say, of rejoicing in the laws of the virtues which are, it is said, superior to all the perfumes perceived by the senses?</p>
      <p> 76.  Many may be stripped of the coat of self-love, but few of the coat of worldly display; while only the dispassionate are free from self-esteem, the last coat of all.</p>
      <p> 77.   Every soul will be stripped of the visible body; but only the soul that has indulged but sparsely in the pleasures of this life will be stripped of the body of sin.</p>
      <p> 78.  All who live will die; but to sin will die only those who have consciously hated it.</p>
      <p> 79.   Who will see himself stripped of sin prior to the ordinary death of the body? And prior to the future stripping, who is there that knows himself and his own nature?</p>

      <p> Prayer unites with the Bridegroom A soul wounded by nuptial love.</p>
      <p> 80.  The deiform soul, placed as it is on the frontier between sensible and spiritual light, is enabled through the former to see and do what pertains to the body, and through the latter what pertains to the Spirit. But as a result of man's inveterate habit of mind, the light of the Spirit has grown dim within the soul, whereas the light of the sensible world shines more brightly within it. Consequently, it cannot fix its attention totally on things divine unless it is wholly united with intelligible light during prayer. In this way, it is compelled to stand midway between darkness and light, linked to spiritual light through participation, and to sensible light by means of the fantasy.</p>
      <p> 81.  An intellect subject to passion cannot penetrate the narrow gate of prayer until it abandons the cares to which it has attached itself. So long as it remains continually occupied with bodily matters, it will inflict suffering on itself.</p>
      <p> 82.  Let prayer inhere in the intellect as a ray in the sun. If the intellect lacks prayer, then worldly cares, like 'clouds driven-about by the wind and bringing no rain' (Jude, verse 12), deprive it of its native luminosity.</p>
      <p> 83.  Strength to pray lies in the deliberate privation of food, and strength to go without food lies in not seeing or hearing about worldly things except when strictly necessary. He who is negligent in this fails to build his fasting on a firm foundation, and so he brings about the collapse of the whole edifice of prayer, which itself is based on fasting.</p>
      <p> 84.  If the intellect does not become detached from all sensible things, it cannot rise upwards and realize its true dignity.</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Part 11</p>
      <p> 85.  Fasting corresponds to daylight, because it is clearly manifest; prayer corresponds to night, because it is invisible. He who practices each of these rightly, the one in conjunction with the other, will attain his goal, the city from which 'pain, sorrow and sighing have fled away' (Isa. 35:10. LXX).</p>
      <p> 86.  Spiritual work can exist even without bodily labor. Blessed, therefore, is the man who regards spiritual work as superior to physical work: through the first he makes up for any deficiency where the second is concerned, because he lives the hidden life of prayer that is manifest to God.</p>
      <p> 87.  St Paul exhorts us to persevere in the faith, to rejoice in hope, and to persist steadfastly in prayer (cf. Rom. 12:12), so that the blessing of joy may be with us. If this is so, then he who fails to persevere lacks faith, and he who does not rejoice lacks hope. For he has abandoned prayer-the source of joy-by not persisting in it.</p>
      <p> 88.  If the intellect has become so closely attached to worldly thoughts through its inveterate involvement with them, how intimate would it not become with prayer if it prayed unceasingly? For, it is said, the intellect will flourish in whatever it makes its constant occupation.</p>
      <p> 89.   Because of long absence from its true home, the intellect has forgotten the luminosity it enjoyed there; hence it must once more become oblivious to things in this world and hasten back to its true home through prayer.</p>
      <p> 90.  Sometimes prayer will fail to bring spiritual refreshment to the intellect, just as a mother's breasts, when they cease to give milk, will not solace her child. At other times the intellect in prayer is like a child that sleeps contentedly in its mother's arms.</p>
      <p> 91.  In the contrite bridal-bed of the virtuous life the bride-prayer - says to her lover: "I will give you my breasts if you dedicate yourself wholly to me' (cf. Song of Songs 7:12).</p>
      <p> 92.  You cannot become intimate with prayer unless you have renounced all material things.</p>
      <p> 93.  During prayer alienate yourself from everything except life and breath if you want to be with the intellect alone.</p>
      <p> 94.  Evidence of an intellect devoted to God is its absorption in the single-phrased Jesus Prayer; of an adroit intelligence, opportune speech; of a non-attached sense-perception, simplicity in taste. When such evidence is present in all three cases, the soul's powers are said to be in good health.</p>
      <p> [V3] 45</p>
      <p> IHas the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>

      <p> 95. The nature of the person who prays must be supple and malleable, like that of children, so that it is receptive</p>
      <p> to the development brought about by prayer. Thus, if you want to be united with prayer, do not be neghgent.</p>
      <p> 96.  Not all have the same purpose in prayer: one man has one purpose, another has another. One prays that, if possible, his heart may always be absorbed in prayer; another, that he may even transcend prayer; and a third, that he may not be hindered by thoughts during prayer. But all pray either to be preserved in what is good, or not to be carried away by evil.</p>
      <p> 97.  If everyone is humbled by prayer-for he who prays with humility is brought to compunction-it follows that anyone outwardly boastful is not praying in a state of humility.</p>
      <p> 98.   Bearing in mind the widow who persuaded the cruel judge to avenge her (cf Luke 18:2-5), the man who prays will never lose heart because the blessings to be gained through prayer are slow in arriving.</p>
      <p> 99.  Prayer deserts you if you give attention to thoughts within and to conversations without. But if you largely ignore both in order to concentrate on it, it will return to you.</p>
      <p> 100.  Unless the-words of prayer penetrate to the soul's depths no tears will moisten your cheeks.</p>
      <p> 101.  Com will spring up for the fanner who has hidden seed in the earth; tears will flow for the monk who diligently attends to the words of prayer.</p>
      <p> 102.  The key to the kingdom of heaven is prayer. He who uses this key as he should sees what blessings the kingdom holds in store for those who love it. He who has no communion with the kingdom gives his attention merely to worldly matters.</p>
      <p> 103.  The intellect cannot say boldly to God at the time of prayer: 'Thou hast burst my bonds asunder; I will offer to Thee the sacrifice of praise' (Ps. 116:16-17. LXX), unless out of a desire for higher things it frees itself from cowardice, indolence, excessive sleep and gluttony, all of which lead it to sin.</p>
      <p> 104.  He who is distracted during prayer stands outside the first veil. He who undistractedly offers the single-phrased Jesus Prayer is within the veil. But he alone has glimpsed the holy of holies who, with his natural thoughts at rest, contemplates that which transcends every intellect, and who has in this way been granted to some extent a vision of the divine light.</p>
      <p> [V3] 46</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>

      <p> 105.  Whenever the soul, paying no attention to external things, is concentrated in prayer, then a kind of flame surrounds it, as fire surrounds iron, and makes it wholly incandescent. The soul remains the same, but can no longer be touched, just as red-hot iron cannot be touched by the hand.</p>
      <p> 106.   Blessed is he who in this life is granted the experience of this state and who sees his body, which by nature is of clay, become incandescent through grace.</p>
      <p> 107.   To beginners the law of prayer is burdensome, like a despotic master; but to the more advanced it is like an erotic force, impelling those smitten by it as a hungry man is impelled towards a rich banquet.</p>
      <p> 108.  To those who genuinely practice the virtues, prayer is sometimes like an overshadowing cloud (cf. Exod. 13:21) that keeps off inflammatory thoughts; at other times, bedewing them as it were with tears, it grants them spiritual visions.</p>
      <p> 109.  The music of the lute sounds sweet to the outer ear; but a soul in which during prayer there is no sound of mystical invocation in the Spirit has not attained true compunction. It is only when 'we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us' (Rom. 8:26), that we are brought to this state of compunction.</p>

      <p> Exalted as it reads these texts The intellect is radiant with spiritual contemplation.</p>
      <p> 1.  The man of spiritual knowledge must recognize when his intellect is in the realm of intellection, when it is in that of thought, and when in that of sense-perception. And in each case he must recognize whether it is there at the right time or at the wrong time.</p>
      <p> 2.  When the intellect is not in the realm of intellection, it is generally in that of thought. And when it is in the realm of thought, it is not in that of intellection. But when it is in the realm of sense-perception, it is associated with all manner of visible and material things.</p>
      <p> 3.  By means of intellection the intellect attains spiritual realities; through thought the reason grasps what is rational. Sense-perception is involved with practical and material realities by means of the fantasy.</p>
      <p> 4.  When the intellect is self-concentrated, it contemplates neither the objects of sense-perception nor those of the rational faculty; on the contrary, it contemplates pure intellects and the rays of divine light flowing with peace and</p>
      <p> joy.</p>
      <p> 5.  The intellection of an object is one thing, the rational apprehension of that object is another, and the object perceived is a third. The first constitutes the essence, the second is an attribute of the essence, and the third comprises the distinctive subject matter.</p>
      <p> 6.  Given free rein, the intellect is insatiable. But when it is confined to one path - that of prayer - and has not yet reached its goal, it feels cramped, and implores its partner to let it enjoy the things from which it has been withheld.</p>
      <p> 7.  When the intellect has been drawn down from the realm above.</p>
      <p> [V3] 48</p>

      <p> it will not return thither unless it is completely detached from worldly things through concentration on things divine.</p>
      <p> 8.   If you cannot make your soul dwell only on thoughts kindred to it, at least keep your body to itself, and reflect continually upon the wretchedness to which it is subject. For thus, by God's mercy, you will in time be able to return to your original nobility.</p>
      <p> 9.  The man engaged in ascetic practice can readily submit his intellect to prayer, while the contemplative can readily submit prayer to the intellect. The first restricts his perception of visible forms, while the second directs his soul's attention towards the inner essences concealed in such forms. Alternatively, the first compels the intellect to apprehend the inner essences of corporeal realities, while the second persuades it to grasp those of incorporeal beings. The inner essences of corporeal realities are also incorporeal, with respect both to their specific qualities and to their essential being.</p>
      <p> 10.   When you free your intellect from self-indulgence in the body, in food and possessions, then whatever you do will be regarded by God as a pure offering. In exchange, the eyes of your heart will be opened, and you will be able clearly to meditate on the divine principles inscribed within it; and their sweetness to your spiritual taste will be greater than that of honey.</p>
      <p> 11.  You will not be able to make your intellect rise above physical and material things, and even above the desire for necessary food, until you introduce it into the pure realm of the righteous. Then mmdfulness of death and of God will fill the earthy heart and cleanse it of all profligate desire.</p>
      <p> 12.   There is nothing more fearful than the thought of death, or more wonderful than remembrance of God. For the first induces the grief that leads us to salvation, and the second bestows gladness. 'I remembered God,' says the prophet, 'and I rejoiced' (Ps. 77:3. LXX). And Sirach says: 'Be mindful of your death and you will not sin' (Ecclus. 7:36). You cannot possess the remembrance of God until you have experienced the astrmgency of the thought of death.</p>
      <p> 13.  Until the intellect has seen God's glory with 'unveiled face' (2 Cor. 3:18), the soul cannot say from experience of that glory: 'I shall exult in the Lord, I shall delight in His salvation' (cf. Ps. 35:9. LXX). For its heart is still shrouded in self-love, so that the world's foundations - the inner essences of things - cannot be re-</p>

      <p> vealed to it. And it will not be free from this shroud until it has undergone both voluntary and involuntary sufferings.</p>
      <p> 14.  The leader of the people of Israel first must flee from Egypt (the actual committing of sin), next must cross over the Red Sea (servitude through attachment), and thirdly must dwell in the desert - the desert lying between the impulses to sin and the outward fulfillment of these impulses. Only then, sending ahead his visual and visionary force, can he spy out the promised land - dispassion (cf Josh. 2:1).</p>
      <p> the promised land only by hearsay. Those who have spied out these blessings with the soul's perception have attained the contemplation of visible things. But those who have been privileged actually to enter the promised land feed in full consciousness on the milk and honey that flows within it (cf. Exod. 3:8) - that is to say, on the inner essences of both corporeal and incorporeal realities.</p>
      <p> 16.  A man still subject to physical impulses has not yet been crucified with Christ (cf. Gal. 2:20), and if he still drags natural thoughts along with him he has not yet been buried with Him. How then can he be raised up with Christ, to live in newness of life?</p>
      <p> 17.  The three most comprehensive virtues of the soul are prayer, silence and fasting. Thus you should refresh yourself with the contemplation of created realities when you relax from prayer; with conversation about the life of virtue when you relax from silence; and with such food as is permitted when you relax from fasting.</p>
      <p> 18.  So long as the intellect dwells among divine realities, it preserves its likeness to God, being filled with goodness and compassion. When it descends to the realm of things perceived by the senses - provided its descent has been opportune and apt - it can give and receive experience and then, strengthened by this, it can return to itself. But when its descent has been inopportune and unnecessary, it acts like an inept general who fails to use most of his fighting force.</p>
      <p> 19.  The paradise of dispassion hidden within us is an image of that in which the righteous will dwell. None the less, not all who fail to enter the first will be excluded from the second.</p>
      <p> 20.  The rays of the visible sun cannot penetrate a shuttered house. Nor will the rays of the spiritual sun penetrate the soul unless its senses are closed to visible things.</p>
      <p> [V3] 50</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Part 111</p>
      <p> 21.  The man of spiritual knowledge is one who descends from the realm of intellection to that of sense-perception in a sublime manner and who raises his soul heavenwards with humility.</p>
      <p> 22.  Traversing the fields a bee gathers the ingredients for honey; traversing the ages the soul infuses sweetness into the mind.</p>
      <p> 23.  A deer that has eaten a snake rashes to water in order to neutralize the poison; but a soul wounded by the arrows of God drinks deep draughts of ceaseless longmg for her assailant.</p>
      <p> 24.  Unimpassioned thoughts arise in one living in a state of self-unity; reasoned calculations in one living in a state of self-division. But when all thoughts have been expelled from the fragmented soul, only incorporeal intellects commune with it, revealing to it the principles of providence and judgment that constitute the foundations of the world.</p>
      <p> 25.  One living in a state of self-division cannot avoid the distinction between male and female; but this may be done by one living in a state of self-unity, when the distinction between male and female is suppressed through attaining the divine likeness in Christ Jesus (cf. Gal. 5:28).</p>
      <p> 26.  Thoughts pertain neither to the non-rational aspect of the soul (for they do not occur in non-rational animals), nor to its intellectual aspect (since they are not to be found in angels). Being products of the reason, they use the imagination as a ladder, and so ascend from the world of the senses to the intellect, conveying to the latter the observations which they have derived from sense-perception; then they redescend from the intellect down to the world of the senses, communicating to it the intellect's principles.</p>
      <p> 27.  When the ship of smfulness is overwhelmed by the flood of tears, evil thoughts will react like people drowning in the waves and trying to grasp hold of something so as to keep afloat.</p>
      <p> 28.   Thoughts gather about the soul according to its underlying quality: either they are like pirates and try to sink it, or they are like oarsmen and try to help it when it is in danger. The first tow it out into the open sea of sinful thoughts; the second steer it back to the nearest calm shore they can find.</p>
      <p> 29.  Unless the soul strips itself of the thoughts that lead up to self-esteem - which is the worst of the seven evil thoughts - it will not be able to strip off this seventh thought either; and so it will not be able to clothe itself in the eighth thought, called by St Paul 'our house</p>
      <p> [V3] 51</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Part 111</p>
      <p> that is from heaven'. Only those who have divested themselves of material things are able 'with heartfelt sighs' to clothe themselves in this eighth thought (cf. 2 Cor. 5:2-4).</p>
      <p> 30.  Angelic thoughts accompany perfect prayer; spiritual thoughts, intermediate prayer; and thoughts about nature, the prayer of beginners.</p>
      <p> 31.   The quality of the grain is usually evident in the ear of com; similarly, the purity of contemplation is usually evident in prayer. The grain is surrounded by a spear-like sheath in order to prevent the birds from eating it; contemplation is armed with spiritual thoughts through which to destroy the temptations that attack it.</p>
      <p> 32.  Through the practice of the virtues the outward aspects of the soul become like the silver-coated wings of a dove. Through contemplation its inward and intelligible aspects become golden. But the soul that has not in this way regained its beauty cannot soar aloft and come to rest in the abode of the blessed.</p>
      <p> [V3] 52</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Part IV</p>
      <p> Here is a meadow full of the fruits Of spiritual practice and contemplation.</p>
      <p> 33.  In olden times men were instructed to offer in the temple the firstfruits of the threshing-floor and the winepress (of. Num. 18:12). Likewise we ought now to offer God self-control and truth as the firstfruits of ascetic practice, and love and prayer as the firstfruits of the virtue of contemplation. Through the first we repulse the assaults of mindless desire and anger; through the second we vanquish empty thoughts and the snares into which they lead us.</p>
      <p> 34.  The first stage of ascetic practice is marked by self-control and truthfulness; the intermediate stage by moderation and humblemindedness; the final stage by freedom from thoughts and the sanctification of the body.</p>
      <p> 35.   Ascetic practice consists not merely in managing to do what is right, but also in doing it rightly: the doer must concern himself with timeliness and congruity.</p>
      <p> 36.  To contemplate is to perceive not only the existing state of corporeal realities but also the ultimate goal of their inner principles.</p>
      <p> 37.   Ascetic practice cannot be consolidated without contemplation, and contemplation cannot be genuine without ascetic practice. For practice must be based on intelligence, and contemplation on practice. In this way evil will be powerless to disrupt practice, and contemplation will be prolific in acts of goodness.</p>
      <p> 38.  The goal of ascetic practice is the mortification of the passions; of spiritual knowledge, the contemplation of the virtues.</p>
      <p> 39.  Ascetic practice is to contemplation as matter is to form; and contemplation is to ascetic practice as the eye is to the face.</p>
      <p> 40.   Many compete for practical virtue, but only one receives the [V3] 53</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Part IV</p>
      <p> prize: he who seeks to attain its goal through contemplation.</p>
      <p> 41.  The man engaged in ascetic practice drinks the draught of compunction during prayer, but the contemplative gets drunk with the best cup (cf. Ps. 23:5. LXX). The first meditates on things that are according to nature, while the second ignores even himself during prayer.</p>
      <p> 42.   The man engaged in ascetic practice cannot persist in spiritual contemplation for long. He is like a person who is being given hospitality but must shortly leave his host's house.</p>
      <p> 43.  When praying, men engaged in ascetic practice are as it were entering the gate of God's commandments; but contemplatives when praising God stand as though in the courts of the virtues. The first give thanks because they have been freed of their fetters, the second because they have also taken captive those who waged war against them.</p>
      <p> 44.   You must be governed by both ascetic practice and contemplation. Otherwise you will be like a ship voyaging without the right sails: either it risks being overturned by the violence of the winds because its sails are too large, or it fails to take advantage of the breeze because they are too small.</p>
      <p> 45.  By the oarsmen of the spiritual ship understand devout thoughts. By oars understand the vital powers of the soul: the incensive and the desiring powers, and the will and free choice. The man engaged in ascetic practice is always in need of these, whereas the contemplative does not always need them. For during prayer the contemplative bids farewell to everything: himself holding the tiller of discernment he keeps awake throughout the night of contemplation, offering praises to Him who holds all things together. And perhaps he sings some love song to his soul as he watches the swell of the salty sea and the tumult of the waves, and marvels at the righteous judgments of God.</p>
      <p> 46.  The person at a stage intermediate between ascetic practice and contemplation does not make the voyage entirely by means of oars, nor entirely by means of spiritual sails, but with the aid of both. Because he possesses a measure of contemplation, he gladly endures the hardships of ascetic practice; and because he is assisted by ascetic practice, he equally accepts the reasons for the shortcomings of his contemplation.</p>
      <p> 47.   The contemplative, with his will assisted by nature as though by a current, voyages without difficulty. But the man engaged in</p>
      <p> [V3] 54</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Part IV</p>
      <p> ascetic practice, finding his resolution undermined by his attachment to sensible things, is much troubled by the waves of his thoughts; indeed, he almost falls into despair because of their violence.</p>
      <p> 48.  Land that is not well tilled is unlikely to yield a good crop of clean grain; and unless the man engaged in ascetic practice proceeds diligently and without ostentation, he will not enjoy a bountiful harvest of good clean fruit as the result of his prayer.</p>
      <p> 49.  The mind engaged in the unremitting practice of prayer is like well-trodden earth: such earth will be smooth and welcoming to tender feet, while the mind will then be untarnished and receptive to pure prayer.</p>
      <p> 50.  In relation to material things, the intellect is assisted by thought; but in relation to immaterial things, thought, unless repudiated, will be like 'a thorn in the flesh' (2 Cor. 12:7) to the intellect.</p>
      <p> 51.   The man engaged in ascetic practice finds that during prayer the knowledge of sensible things covers his heart like a veil, which he is unable to remove because of his attachment to these things. Only the contemplative man, owing to his non-attachment, can to some degree see the glory of God 'with unveiled face' (2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
      <p> 52.  Prayer combined with spiritual contemplation constitutes the promised land in which there flows, like 'milk and honey' (Exod.  3:8), the spiritual knowledge of the principles of God's providence and judgment. Prayer</p>
      <p> combined with a certain measure of natural contemplation is Egypt, in which those who pray still encounter the memory of their grosser desires. Simple prayer is manna in the desert (cf Num. 11:7). Since it is unvarying, this manna does not disclose to the impatient the promised blessings for which they long; but for those who persevere with such restricted food, it imparts most excellent and abiding nourishment.</p>
      <p> 53.  Ascetic practice combined with contemplation is like the body united to its ruling spirit. Without contemplation, it is like flesh dominated by a spirit of self-will.</p>
      <p> 54.  Sense-perception is the forecourt of the deiform soul; the reason is her temple; and the intellect, her high priest. The intellect is to be found in the forecourt when held captive by inept thoughts; in the temple when circumscribed by thoughts that are apposite. When it is free from both, it is privileged to enter the holy sanctuary.</p>
      <p> 55.   There is a sound of grief and lamentation in the house of the [V3] 55</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Part IV</p>
      <p> soul still at the stage of ascetic practice, because of the suffering it endures; but in the house of the contemplative soul 'a voice of exultation and thanksgiving' (cf Ps. 42:4. LXX) is heard, because of its spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 56.   On account of his sufferings, the man engaged in ascetic practice wants to leave this life and to be with Christ; the contemplative, on the contrary, is quite content to remain in the flesh, both because of the joy that he receives from prayer, and because of the use that he can be to his fellow-men (cf. Phil. 1:23-24).</p>
      <p> 57.  Where people of greater intelligence are concerned, contemplation precedes ascetic practice, whereas in the case of the more obtuse, ascetic practice precedes contemplation. Both contemplation and ascetic practice lead to the same auspicious conclusion; but this is attained more quickly by those in whom contemplation precedes ascetic practice.</p>
      <p> 58.  Paradise is the contemplation of intelligible realities. During prayer the man of spiritual understanding enters into it as into his own home; but the man engaged in ascetic practice is like a passer-by: he wants to look in, but is prevented by the wall of his spiritual immaturity.</p>
      <p> 59.  Bodily passions are like wild animals, while passions of the soul are like birds. The man engaged in ascetic practice can keep the animals out of the noetic vineyard; but unless he enters into a state of spiritual contemplation, he cannot keep the birds away, however much he strives to guard himself inwardly.</p>
      <p> 60.  The man engaged in ascetic practice cannot rise above ethical propriety, unless he goes beyond the natural law-as Abraham went forth from his own land-and beyond his own limited state of development-as Abraham left his kinsmen (cf. Gen. 12:1). In this way, as a mark of God's approval, he will be liberated from the all-embracing hold of pleasure; for it is this veil of pleasure, wrapped around us from our birth, that prevents us from receiving complete freedom.</p>
      <p> 61.  When spring comes, a colt cannot bear being confined to the stable and feeding out of the manger. Similarly, the newly-initiated intellect cannot long bear being confined to prayer: like the colt, it would gladly go out into the fields of natural contemplation, there to devote itself to psalmody and spiritual reading.</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Part IV</p>
      <p> 62.  Ascetic practice girds the soul's vital powers with fasting and vigil, while contemplative virtue keep the spiritual powers burning like lamps by means of silence and prayer. The vital powers have the reason as their tutor, the spiritual powers have the indwelling Logos as their bridal escort.</p>
      <p> 63.  The uninitiated intellect is not permitted to enter the ripe vineyard of prayer. It is given access only - and barely - to the literal repetition of the psalms, as a poor man is allowed to glean the small grapes left on the vines.</p>
      <p> 64.  Just as not all those who have audience with a king can also dine with him, so not all those who have attained a certain familiarity with prayer will rise to contemplation during it.</p>
      <p> 65.  Apt silence bridles anger; moderation in food bridles mindless desire; and the single-phrased Jesus Prayer bridles unruly thought.</p>
      <p> 66.   The man who dives into the sea for pearls will fail in his efforts unless he first strips off his clothes; similarly, the man who plunges into the sea of spiritual knowledge in search of the pearl of wisdom will fail to find it unless he strips himself of his attachment to the world of the senses.</p>
      <p> 67.  The intellect that encloses itself within the mind during prayer is like a bridegroom conversing with the bride inside the bridal chamber. But the intellect that is not allowed to enter stands dejectedly outside, crying:' "Who will lead me into the walled city'?" (Ps. 60:9). Who will guide me until I no longer see vanities and delusions during prayer'?'</p>
      <p> 68.  As food without salt is to the taste, so is prayer without compunction to the intellect.</p>
      <p> 69.  The soul still in pursuit of prayer is like a woman in the pains of childbirth; but the soul that has attained prayer is like a woman who has given birth and is full of joy on account of her child.</p>
      <p> 70.  In olden times the Amorites used to come down from the mountain and attack those trying to force their way through (cf Deut. 1:44). In our days evil forgetfulness repulses those who, before attaining purity, attempt to rise to higher form-free prayer.</p>
      <p> 71.  The demons are extremely hostile to pure prayer. Moreover, it is not the host of psalms that can terrify them, as an army might terriiy an external enemy; it is the alliance of the intellect with the reason and of the reason with sense-perception.</p>
      <p> 72.   Prayer free from passion is like sustaining bread to those who [V3] 57</p>
      <p> IHas the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Part IV</p>
      <p> pray; prayer combined with some degree of contemplation is like nourishing oil; and prayer that is free of forms is like sweet-smelling wine. Those who drink deeply of this wine are rapt out of themselves.</p>
      <p> 73.  It is said of the wild ass that it scorns the crowds in the city, and of the unicorn that it cannot be fettered by anyone (cf Job 39:7-9). Similarly, the intellect, having mastered thoughts both natural and contrary to nature, mocks their vanity, and during prayer cannot be dominated by any of the objects of sense-perception.</p>
      <p> 75.  The spiritual aspirant must restrain his senses through frugality and his intellect through the single-phrased Jesus Prayer. Having in this way detached himself from the passions, he will find himself caught up to the Lord during prayer.</p>
      <p> 76.  Those who indulge their passions, being materially-minded, are distracted during prayer by their thoughts as by frogs. Those who restrain their passions are gladdened during prayer by the changing forms of contemplation, which are like nightingales moving from one branch to another. But in the dispassionate there is silence and great quiescence of both thought and intellection during prayer.</p>
      <p> 77.  In olden times, when Miriam, the sister of Moses, saw the fall of the enemy, she took up a timbrel and led the women who sang the victory-songs (cf. Exod. 15:20-21). In our days, when the soul overcomes the passions, love -the highest of the virtues - rises up to praise it. As though taking up the lyre, it embarks upon the contemplation that long ago has been appointed for it as a hard-won addition to its beauty; and it ceaselessly glorifies God, rejoicing with its sister-virtues.</p>
      <p> 78.  When through continuous prayer the words of the psalms are brought down into the heart, then the heart like good soil begins to produce by itself various (lowers: roses, the vision of incorporeal realities; lilies, the luminosity of corporeal realities; and violets, the many judgments of God, hard to understand.</p>
      <p> 79.   A flame gives light so long as it is wedded to matter. But the ' soul becomes God's shrine only when free from matter. The flame rises up so long as it has something to bum on; the soul is raised upward until it is consummated in divine love.</p>
      <p> [V3] 58</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Part IV</p>
      <p> 80.  A soul that has denied itself completely, and has been raised above creation wholly to the realm of prayer, does not descend whenever it wishes: it descends when He who weighs and measures all our affairs judges it to be right.</p>
      <p> 81.  When listlessness is expelled from the soul, and malice from the mind, then the intellect, naked in simplicity, innocent and totally stripped of the veil of shame, sings a new song to God, with joyful gratitude celebrating the forefeast and inauguration of the life to come.</p>
      <p> 82.  When the soul that prays begins to respond to the higher divine realities, then, like the bride in the Song of Songs, it sings to its companions: 'My Beloved stretched His hand through the opening, and my womb trembled because of Him' (Song of Songs 5:4).</p>
      <p> 83.  As a soldier returning from war unburdens himself of his arms, so the man engaged in ascetic practice unburdens himself of thoughts when he attains to contemplation. For as the first has no need of arms except in time of war, so the second has no need of thoughts unless he reverts to the things apprehended by the senses.</p>
      <p> 84.   The man engaged in ascetic practice sees corporeal realities in terms of their relations; the contemplative sees them in terms of their nature. Only the spiritually illumined grasps the inner principles of what the other two</p>
      <p> perceive.</p>
      <p> 85.  Incorporeal realities may be apprehended in the  logoi  or inner principles of corporeal realities; but in incorporeal realities may be apprehended the supraessential Logos to whom every diligent soul urgently strives to return.</p>
      <p> 86.  The inner principles of corporeal realities are concealed like bones within objects apprehended by the senses: no one who has not transcended attachment to sensible things can see them.</p>
      <p> 87.  A soldier casts off his arms when he has ceased fighting; the contemplative casts off thoughts when he returns to the Lord.</p>
      <p> 88.   A general becomes despondent when he fails to capture any booty in war; so does the mm engaged in ascetic practice when he fails to attain spiritual contemplation in prayer.</p>
      <p> 89.   When bitten by some wild animal, a deer runs swiftly to earthly springs of water; a soul wounded by the most tender arrow of prayer hastens towards the light of incorporeal realities.</p>
      <p> 90.  Just as the eye cannot see a grain of wheat unless the eyelids are open, so the practical intellect cannot see its own nature unless stripped of the attachment to sensible things that obscures its vision.</p>
      <p> [V3] 59</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Part IV</p>
      <p> 91.  The stars are hidden when the sun rises, and thoughts vanish when the intellect returns to its own realm.</p>
      <p> 92.  When the stage of ascetic practice has been fulfilled, spiritual visions flood the intellect like the sun's rays coming over the horizon; even though they are native to it, and embrace it because of its purity, they appear to come from outside.</p>
      <p> 93.  If on descending from the realm of vision to attend to practical matters the contemplative intellect were to speak of what it has experienced, it would say such things as: 'What is more wondrous than divine beauty, or more lovely than the sense of God's magnificence? What longing is so keen and unbearable as that engendered by God in a soul purified of every vice and truly able to say: "I am wounded with love"?' (Song of Songs 2:5. LXX).</p>
      <p> 94.  'My heart grew warm within me and a fire was kindled during my meditation' (Ps. 39:3. LXX). So may speak the man who has no difficulty in following God through prayer and who has no desire for temporal life.</p>
      <p> 95.  When it has rejected evil, let the soul still engaged in ascetic struggle repeat the words of the Song to the malicious demons and thoughts that forcibly try to turn its attention once more to vanities and delusion: 'I have taken off my coat; how can I put it on again? I have washed my feet; how can I make them dirty?' (Song of Songs 5:3).</p>
      <p> 96.  The soul that enjoys God's love is bold enough to say to Him: Tell me. Good Shepherd, where You graze Your Sheep, and where You rest Your lambs at noon, so that by following them I may avoid becoming like one encircled by the flocks of Your companions' (cf. Song of Songs 1:7. LXX).</p>
      <p> cries out like the soul in the Song: 'By night on my bed 1 sought Him whom I love; I sought Him but I did not find Him; I called Him, but He did not listen to me. I will rise now through more strenuous prayer and will go about the city, in the wide streets and the market-places, and will look for my Beloved. Perhaps I shall find Him who is present in all things and beyond all things; and I will feast on the vision of His glory' (cf. Song of Songs 3:1-2. LXX).</p>
      <p> 98. When the soul begins to be all tears from the joy that accompanies prayer, it grows bold and, like a bride to her bridegroom, cries: 'Let my Beloved come down mto His garden, and let Him feed on</p>
      <p> [V3] 60</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Part IV</p>
      <p> the hard-won consolation of my tears as though on choice fruit' (cf Song of Songs 5:1. LXX).</p>
      <p> 99.   When the soul still engaged in ascetic struggle begins to be struck with wonder at the Creator because of the magnificence and beauty of created things, and to savor the delight that comes from them, it too cries in astonishment: 'How beautiful You are, my Bridegroom, paradise of Your Father: You are a flower of the field and a cedar of His, like the cedars of Lebanon. I yearned for His shadow, and I sat down, and His fruit was sweet in my mouth' (cf Song of Songs 2:1-3. LXX).</p>
      <p> 100.  If someone who receives a king in his house becomes in this way illustrious, admired of all and full of joy, how much more so will the soul that, when purified, receives the King of kings, according to His unfailing promise? But it must guard itself with great care, casting out everything that does not seem to please Him, and introducing everything that does.</p>
      <p> 101.  If a person is expecting to be summoned tomorrow by the king, will he have any concern other than to consider what he will say in order to please the king? A soul that takes careful note of this will not be found unprepared when it comes before the future judgment seat.</p>
      <p> 102.  Blessed is the soul that, because it expects its Lord daily, thinks nothing of the day's toil or of the night's, since He is going to appear in the morning.</p>
      <p> 103.  God sees all men, but only those see God who perceive nothing during prayer. God listens to those who see Him, while those to whom He does not listen do not see Him. Blessed is the man who believes that he is seen by God; for his foot will not slip (cf. Ps. 73:2) unless this is God's will.</p>
      <p> 104.  The blessings of the kingdom within us-which the world-loving eye has not seen, and the presumptuous ear has not heard, and which have not entered into a heart empty of the Holy Spirit (cf. 1 Cor. 2:9) - are a pledge and foretaste of the blessings to be given by God to the righteous in the kingdom that is to come. If we do not savor the first, which are the fruits of the Spirit (cf. Gal. 5:22), we will not be able to enjoy the second.</p>
      <p> 105.  The thoughts of those engaged in ascetic practice are like deer. Deer sometimes go up into the mountains because they are frightened of hunters, and sometimes down to the valleys because they want</p>
      <p> [V3] 61</p>
      <p> IHas the Presbyter</p>
      <p> A Gnomic Anthology Part IV</p>
      <p> what they can find there. Similarly those engaged in ascetic practice can neither be constantly in a state of spiritual contemplation, for they are still immature, nor be constantly in a state of natural contemplation, for they do not always seek relaxation. The thoughts of contemplatives, however, disdain inferior forms of contemplation.</p>
      <p> 106.  Raindrops moisten the furrows, and tear-laden sighs rising from tile heart soften the soul's state during prayer.</p>
      <p> 107.  No one can contemplate the Triune Divinity unless his vision transcends the material dyad as well as the material monad; and he will not transcend the latter unless he has integrated the intellections of his intellect.</p>
      <p> 108.  It is less hard to check the downward flow of a river than for one who prays to check the turbulence of the intellect when he wishes, preventing it from fragmenting itself among visible things and concentrating it on the higher realities kindred to it. This is so in spite of the fact that to check the flow of a river is contrary to nature, while to check the turbulence of the intellect accords with nature.</p>
      <p> 109.  Those who inwardly purify the intellect by ignoring what is visible are filled with such wonder and such joy that they would not be able to find room for anything earthly, even though they were to be flooded with all the things over which people fight.</p>
      <p> 110.  Simply to speak of the laws of nature is enough to arouse deep admiration. But when they are fully understood, they are as fields full of flowers, whose lavish blossoms give out a spiritual sweetness like nectar from heaven.</p>
      <p> 111.  Bees surround their queen among fresh meadow-flowers; and the soul that is unceasingly in a state of compunction is surrounded and assisted by the angelic powers, for it is kindred to them.</p>
      <p> 112.  Within the visible world, man is as it were a second world; and the same is true of thought within the intelligible world. For man is the herald of heaven and earth, and of all that is in them; while thought interprets the intellect and sense-perception, and all that pertains to them. Without man and thought both the sensible and the intelligible worlds would be inarticulate.</p>
      <p> 113.   A person released from long captivity is not so full of joy as the intellect freed from its attachment to sensible things and winging its way towards the heavenly realm that is its native land.</p>
      <p> [V3] 62</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Part IV</p>
      <p> 114.  A person who prays, not with attention, but distractedly, will regard the psalms as uncouth; and from the point of view of the psalms he will appear equally uncouth. Both will be considered mad by the demons.</p>
      <p> 115.   Those to whom the world is crucified are not the same as those who are crucified to the world (cf Gal. 6:14). For the first, the nails are fasting and vigils; for the second, they are to shed every possession and to be treated with</p>
      <p> contempt. Without the second, the sufferings involved in the first are useless.</p>
      <p> 116.  No one can pray purely if he is constrained by the passions of ostentation and ambition. For the attachments and frivolous thoughts in which these passions involve him will twine around him like ropes, and during prayer will drag his intellect down like a fettered bird that is trying to fly.</p>
      <p> 117.  The intellect cannot be peaceful during prayer unless it has acquired self-control and love. With God's help the first strives to put an end to the body's hostility towards the soul, the second to our hostility towards our fellow-men. Upon the man who has in this way established peace within himself, 'the peace that surpasses the intellect' (Phil. 4:7) then descends and, according to God's promise, takes up its abode in him.</p>
      <p> 118.   The person struggling to enter the kingdom of God must excel in works of righteousness: in almsgiving, by providing out of his own paucity; and in suffering for the sake of peace, by responding to trials with patient endurance in the Lord.</p>
      <p> 119.   Neither one who falls short of virtue because of negligence nor one who out of presumption oversteps it will reach the harbor of dispassion. Indeed, no one will enjoy the blessings of righteousness who tries to attain them by means of either deficiency or excess.</p>
      <p> 120.  Land cannot make a farmer wealthy merely by yielding the equivalent to the grain which he has sown, or even by adding to it slightly; it can do so only by multiplying it. Similarly, the achievements of one engaged in ascetic practice cannot make him righteous unless his diligence towards God exceeds his natural propensity.</p>
      <p> 121.  Not everyone who does not love his neighbor actually hates him, and not everyone who does not hate his neighbor is able to love him. It is one thing to envy one's neighbor's progress, and another to refrain from hindering it. The height of malice consists not simply in</p>
      <p> [V3] 63</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Part IV</p>
      <p> being galled at one's neighbor's superiority, but also in traducing his good qualities by saying that they are not good at aU.</p>
      <p> 122.   Bodily passions are one thing, passions of the soul another. Passions according to nature are other than those which are contrary to nature. The person who repulses the former, but does not take account of the latter, is like a man who sets up a high thick fence to keep wild animals out, but wishes joy to the birds eating the finest grapes in his spiritual vineyard.</p>
      <p> 123.  First the soul imagines evil, then desires it, then feels pleasure or pain with respect to it, then becomes fully conscious of it, and finally unites with it either outwardly or inwardly. Thoughts accompany all these phases, except that of the initial stimulus. If this is repudiated, none of the evil that follows will be actualized.</p>
      <p> 124.  Those who are approaching dispassion will be troubled only by fantasies; those who restrain their passions, by desires; those who indulge their passions, by entanglements. Those who misuse what they have to meet their needs, but feel remorse for it, are conscious of the evil they do; those who feel no remorse unite with evil.</p>
      <p> 125.  Pleasure has its seat in every part of the body, but does not disturb everyone in the same way. In some people, it disturbs more the desiring aspect of the soul; in others, the mcensive aspect; and in others, the intelligence. It does this through gluttony, bad temper and malice, the source of all the unholy passions.</p>
      <p> 126.  Like the gates of a city, we have to open the organs of sense-perception in order to satisfy essential needs; but in so doing we must take care not to give access at the same time to warlike tribes that seek to attack us.</p>
      <p> 127.   Pleasure is the mother of desire; bad temper, of anger; malice, of jealousy. Whoever does not struggle against the ringleaders will not be left in peace by their subordinates; nor can you restrain the passions if you practice the commandments only because you are forced to do so.</p>
      <p> 128.  Those who repulse provocations prevent thoughts from entering the spiritual vineyard like marauding animals and ruining it. Those who couple with provocations, but do not take pleasure in them, simply allow the animals to enter, though not to touch any of the things inside. Those who enjoyably commune with the passions through thoughts, yet do not reach the point of giving assent to them, are like men who, after allowing a wild boar to come through the</p>
      <p> [V3] 64</p>
      <p> Ilias the Presbyter A Gnomic Anthology</p>
      <p> Part IV</p>
      <p> fence into the vineyard, have stopped him from taking his fill of the grapes but then have found him more than they can control. Such people often end by giving assent to the passions.</p>
      <p> 129.  If you still have to give thought to the exercising of self-control you have not yet attained simplicity. Only one engaged in ascetic struggle, it is said, has to exercise self-control (cf 1 Cor. 9:25), not one who is spiritually perfect. A person engaged in ascetic struggle is like a man who has a vineyard or corn-land not among other vineyards or other farms, but somewhere out on its own, and which for this reason needs much guarding and watching. No one, however, touches the vineyard of the person who has attained simplicity: it is like that of a king or some other awesome potentate, whose very name is enough to make thieves and passers-by shudder at the thought of trying to enter it.</p>
      <p> 130.   Many ascend the cross of mortification, but few consent to be nailed to it. For many submit to hardships and afflictions of their own choosing; but only those who have died completely to this world and to the respite it offers readily submit to the sufferings that come against their will.</p>
      <p> 131.  Many have removed all their 'coats of skin' (Gen. 3:21) except the last, that of self-esteem. This is cast off only by those who are disgusted with what produces it: their own self-satisfaction.</p>
      <p> 132.  The person who is offered bodily comfort and men's praise, but refuses to accept them, has been stripped of the final coat, that of self-esteem. To him is granted the grace of being clothed, even in this present life, with the splendor of the heavenly dwelling-place, longed for with so many sighs.</p>
