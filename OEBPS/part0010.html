      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> and so, when it has put away the sensual desire, it is no longer troubled by either the one or the other, having anchored the whole power of the soul in divine and unassailable liberty. The Lord, wanting to impart this liberty to His disciples says, 'Take my yoke upon you and learn from Me; for I am gentle and humble in heart; and you will find rest for your souls' (Matt. 11:29). He calls the rule of the divine kingdom "rest' because it confers on those worthy of it a lordship free from all servitude.</p>
      <p> If the indestructible power of the pure kingdom is given to the humble and the gentle, what man will be so lacking in</p>
      <p> love and so completely without appetite for divine blessings that he will not desire the greatest degree of humility and gentleness in order to take on the stamp of the divine kingdom, so far as this is possible for men, and to bear in himself by grace an exact spiritual likeness of Christ, who is by nature the truly great king? In this likeness, says St Paul, 'there is neither male nor female' (Gal. 3:28), that is, there is neither anger nor desire. Of these, the first tyrannically perverts judgment and makes the mind betray the law of nature, while the second scorns the one dispassionate cause and nature, that alone is traly desirable, in favor of what is inferior, giving preference to the flesh rather than to the spirit, and taking pleasure more in visible things than in the magnificence and glory of intelligible realities. In this way with the lubricity of sensual pleasure it seduces the intellect from the divine perception of spiritual realities that is proper to it.</p>
      <p> It is our aim to make the intelligence stand alone, stripped through the virtues of its affection for the body: for this affection, even when totally dispassionate, is still natural. The spirit, completely triumphing over nature, has to persuade the intellect to desist from moral philosophy m older to commune with the supra-essential Logos through direct and undivided contemplation, in spite of the fact that moral philosophy help the intellect to cut itself off from, and to go beyond, things pertaining to the flux of time. For when the intellect has become free from its attachment to sensible objects, it should not be burdened my longer with preoccupations about morality as with a shaggy cloak.</p>
      <p> Elijah clearly reveals this mystery in a typological manner through his actions (cf. 2 Kgs. 2:11-14). For when he was borne aloft he gave Elisha his cloak, that is, the mortification of the flesh which</p>
      <p> [V2] 294</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> constitutes the chief glory of moral conduct. He did this so that Elisha should have the support of the Spirit in his battle against hostile powers and should triumph over the flux and instability of nature, typified by the Jordan: so that, in other words, he would not be immersed in the turbidity and slime of material attachment and thus prevented from Crossing over into the holy land. Meanwhile, Elijah himself advanced freely towards God, Unencumbered by attachment to any created thing. His desire being undivided and his will unmixed, he made his dwelling with Him who is simple by nature, carried there by the interdependent cardinal virtues, harnessed spiritually to one another like horses of fire.</p>
      <p> Elijah knew that in the disciple of Christ there must be no imbalance of dispositions, for such diversity is proof of a lack of inward unity. Thus the passion of desire produces a diffusion of blood around the heart, and the mcensive power when roused causes the blood to boil. He who already lives and moves and has his being in Christ (cf. Acts</p>
      <p> 17:28) has annulled in himself the production of what is imbalanced and disunited: as 1 have said, he does not bear within him, like male and female, the opposing dispositions of such passions. In this way, the intelligence is not enslaved by the passions and made subject to their fickleness. Naturally endowed with the holiness of the divine image, the intelligence urges the soul to conform itself by its own free choice to the divine likeness, in this way the soul is able to participate in the great kingdom that exists in a substantive manner in God, the Father of all, and to become a translucent abode of the Holy Spirit, receiving - if it may be expressed in this way - the whole authority of the knowledge of the divine nature in so far as this is possible. Where this authority prevails, the production of what is inferior automatically comes to an end and only what is superior is generated; for the soul that through the grace of its calling resembles God keeps inviolate withm itself the Substance of the blessings bestowed upon it. In souls such as this Christ always desires to be bom in a mystical way, becoming incarnate in those who attain salvation, and making the soul that gives birth to Him a Virgin Mother; for such a soul, to put it briefly, is not conditioned by categories like those of male and female that typify a nature subject to generation and corruption.</p>
      <p> Let no one be shocked to hear me speak of the corruption that is inherent in generation. For when one has justly and dispassionately</p>
      <p> [V2] 295</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> examined the nature of what comes into being and ceases to be, one will clearly see that generation begins with corruption and ends in corruption. Christ, and the Christ-like way of life and understanding, as 1 have said, are free of the passions characteristic of such generation. At least, this is the case if St Paul was speaking the truth when he said that in Christ Jesus "there is neither male nor female" (Gal. 3:28), meaning by these terms the characteristics and passions of a nature subject to generation and corruption. For in Christ and the Christ-like way of life there is only a deifonn understanding imbued with divine knowledge, and a single disposition of will and purpose that chooses only virtue.</p>
      <p> Moreover, in Christ there is neither Greek nor Jew (cf. Gal. 3:28). By this is meant differing or, rather, contrary views about God. The Greek affirms a host of ruling principles and divides the one fundamental principle into opposing operations and powers, devising a polytheistic worship full of contradictions because of the multitude of objects to be venerated, and ridiculous because of its many modes of veneration. The Jew affirms a fundamental principle which, although one, is narrow, imperfect and almost non-existent, since it is devoid of immanent consciousness and life; and so he falls into an evil which is just as bad as that into which the Greek falls for the opposite reason, namely disbelief in the true God. For he limits the fundamental principle to a single Person, one that exists without Logos and Spirit, or that merely possesses Logos and Spirit as qualities; for he fails to realize</p>
      <p> what kind of God this would be if deprived of these two other Persons, or how He could be God if assigned them as accidents by participation, as is the case with created intelligent beings. Neither Greek nor Jew, then, has any place at all in Christ. In Him there is only the principle of true religion and the steadfast law of mystical theology, that rejects both the dilatation of the Divinity, as in Greek polytheism, and the contraction of the Divinity, as in Jewish monotheism. In this way the Divine is not full of internal contradictions, as it is with the Greeks, because of a natural plurality, nor is it regarded as passible, as it is by the Jews, because of being a single Person, deprived of Logos and Spirit, or only possessing Logos and Spirit as qualities, without itself being Intellect and Logos and Spirit.</p>
      <p> Mystical theology teaches us, who through faith have been adopted by grace and brought to the knowledge of truth, to recognize</p>
      <p> [V2] 296</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> one nature and power of the Divinity, that is to say, one God contemplated in Father, Son and Holy Spirit. It teaches us to know God as a single unoriginate Intellect, self-existent, the begetter of a single, self-existent, unoriginate Logos, and the source of a single everlasting life, self-existent as the Holy Spirit: a Trinity in Unity and a Unity in Trinity. The Divinity is not one thing in another thing: the Trinity is not in the Unity like an accident in a substance or vice versa, for God is without qualities. The Divinity is not one thing and another thing: the Unity does not differ from the Trinity by distinction of nature; the nature is simple and single in both. Nor in the Divinity is one thing dependent on or prior to another: the Trinity is not distinguished from the Unity, or the Unity from the Trinity, by inferiority of power; nor is the Unity distinguished from the Trinity as something common and general abstracted in a purely conceptual manner from the particulars in which it occurs: it is a substantively self-subsistent essence and a truly self-consolidating power. Nor in the Divinity has one thing come into being through another: there is withm it no such mediating relationship as that of cause and effect, since it is altogether identical with itself and free from relationships. Nor in the Divinity is one thing derived from another: the Trinity does not derive from the Unity, since it is ungenerated and self-manifested. On the contrary, the Unity and the Trinity are both affirmed and conceived as truly one and the same, the first denoting the principle of essence, the second the mode of existence. The whole is the single Unity, not divided by the Persons; and the whole is also the single Trinity, the Persons of which are not confused by the Unity. Thus polytheism is not introduced by division of the Unity or disbelief in the true God by confusion of the Persons.</p>
      <p> When Christian doctrine avoids these errors it achieves a genuine splendor. By Christian doctrine I mean the teaching of Christ, the new proclamation of trath in which there is neither male nor female, that is, the signs and</p>
      <p> passions of human nature when subject to birth and decay; neither Greek nor Jew, that is, contrary views of the Divinity; neither uncircumcision nor circumcision (cf. Col. 3:11), that is, the different kinds of worship appropriate to these views, the first divinizing nature because of the passions and setting the creature against the Creator, and the second because of its misuse of symbols of the Law vilifying visible creation and</p>
      <p> [V2] 297</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> slandering the Creator as the source of evil. Both constitute equally an insult to the Divine and lead equally to evil. Neither in Christian doctrine is there barbarian or Scythian, that is, the deliberate fragmentation of the single nature of human beings which has made them subject to the unnatural law of mutual slaughter; neither is there bond or free, that IS, the fortuitous division of this same nature which leads to one person despising another although both are by nature of an equal dignity, and which encourages men to dominate others tyrannically, thus violating the divine image in man. 'But Christ is all and in all' (Col. 3:11), in spirit fashioning the unongmate kingdom by means of that which lies beyond nature and law.</p>
      <p> This kingdom is characterized, as we have shown, by humility and gentleness of heart. It is the combination of these two qualities that constitutes the perfection of the person-created according to Christ. For every humbler person is invariably gentle and every gentle person is invariably humble. A person is humble when he knows that his very being is on loan to him. He is gentle when he realizes how to use the powers given to him in a manner that accords with nature and, withdrawing their activity completely from the senses, places them at the service of the intelligence in order to produce the virtues. In this way his intellect moves incessantly towards God, while where his senses are concerned he is not in the least perturbed by any of the things that afflict the body, nor does he stamp his soul with any trace of distress, thereby disrupting his joy-creative state. For he does not regard what is painful in the senses as a privation of pleasure: He knows only one pleasure, the marriage of the soul with the Logos. To be deprived of this marriage is endless torment, extending by nature through all the ages. Thus when he has left the body and all that pertains to it, he is impelled towards union with the divine; for even if he were to be master of the whole world, he would still recognize only one real disaster: failure to attain by grace the deification for which he is hoping.</p>
      <p> Let us, then, 'cleanse ourselves from all pollution of the flesh and spirit' (2 Cor. 7:1), so that when we have extinguished our sensual desire, which indecently wantons with the passions, we may hallow the divine name. And with our intelligence let us bind fast our anger, deranged and frenzied by sensual pleasure, so that we may</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> receive the kingdom of God the Father, that comes to us through gentleness.</p>
      <p> Having done all this, we may go on to the next phrase of the prayer, saying, 'Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven' (Matt. 6:10). He who worships God mystically with the faculty of the intelligence alone, keeping it free from sensual desire and anger, fulfils the divine will on earth just as the orders of angels fulfill it in heaven. He has become in all things a co-worshipper and fellow-citizen with the angels, conforming to St Paul's statement, 'Our citizenship is in heaven' (Phil. 3:20). Among the angels desire does not sap the intellect's intensity through sensual pleasure, nor does anger make them rave and storm indecently at their fellow creatures: there is only the intelligence naturally leading intelligent beings towards the source of intelligence, the Logos Himself. God rejoices in intelligence alone and this is what He demands from us His servants. He reveals this when He says to David, 'What have I in heaven, and besides yourself what have I desired on earth?' (Ps. 73:25. LXX). Nothing is offered to God in heaven by the holy angels except intelligent worship; and it is this that God also demands from us when He teaches us to say in our prayers, 'Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven' (Matt. 6:10).</p>
      <p> Let our intelligence, then, be moved to seek God, let our desire be roused in longing for Him, and let our incensive power struggle to keep guard over our attachment to Him. Or, more precisely, let our whole intellect be directed towards God, tensed by our incensive power as if by some nerve, and fired with longing by our desire at its most ardent. For if we imitate the heavenly angels in this way, we will find ourselves always worshipping God, behaving on earth as the angels do in heaven. For, like that of the angels, our intellect will not be attracted in the least by anything less than God.</p>
      <p> If we live in the way we have promised, we will receive, as daily and life-giving bread for the nourishment of our souls and the maintenance of the good state with which we have been blessed, the Logos Himself; for if was He who said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven and gives life to the world', (cf. John 6:33-35). In proportion to our capacity the Logos will become everything for us who are nourished through virtue and wisdom; and in accordance with His own judgment He will be embodied differently in each recipient of salvation while we are still living in this age. This</p>
      <p> [V2]299</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> is indicated in the phrase of the prayer which says, 'Give us this day our daily bread" (Matt. 6:11).</p>
      <p> I believe that the expression "this day" refers to the present age. It is as if one should say, after a clearer understanding of the context of the prayer, "Since we are in this present mortal life, give us this day our daily bread which Thou hast originally prepared for human nature so that it might become immortal (cf Gen. 1:9); for in this way the food of the bread of life and knowledge will triumph over the death that comes through sin." The transgression of the divine commandment prevented the first man from partaking of this bread (cf. Gen. 3:19). Indeed, had he taken his fill of this divine food, he would not have been made subject to death through sin.</p>
      <p> He who prays to receive this daily bread, however, does not automatically receive it all as it is in itself: he receives it in accordance with his receptive capacity. For the Bread of Life in His love gives Himself to all who ask, but He does not give to all in the same way. He gives liberally to those who have done great things, and more sparingly to those who have achieved less. Thus He gives to each person in accordance with the receptive capacity of his or her intellect.</p>
      <p> The Savior Himself has led me to this interpretation of the phrase we are considering, because He commands His disciples explicitly not to take any thought at all for sensible food saying, "Do not worry about your life, what you will eat, or what you will drink, or about your body, what you will put on. For the heathen seek all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things as well will be given to you' (Matt. 6:25, 32, 33). How then can it be that He teaches us to pray for what He commands us not to seek? Obviously He does not order us to do anything of the kind: we should ask in prayer only for things that we are commanded to seek. If the Savior commanded us to seek only the kingdom of God and righteousness, then surely He intended those who desire divine gifts to ask for this kingdom in their prayers, in this way, by showing what petitions are blessed by His grace. He conjoins the intention of those who ask with the will of Him who bestows the grace.</p>
      <p> If, however, we also take this clause to mean we should pray for the daily bread that sustains our present life, let us be careful not to overstep the bounds of the prayer, presumptuously assuming that</p>
      <p> [V2]300</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> we will live for many cycles of years and forgetting that we are mortal and that our life passes by like a shadow; but free from anxiety let us pray for bread sufficient for one day at a time, thus showing that as Christian philosophers we make life a rehearsal for death, in our purpose anticipating nature and, even before death comes, cutting off the soul's anxiety about bodily things. In this way the soul will not transfer its natural appetite to material things, attaching itself to what is corruptible, and will not learn the greed that deprives it of a rich possession of divine blessings.</p>
      <p> Let us therefore shun the love of matter and our attachment to matter with all the strength we have, as if washing dust from our spiritual eyes; and let us be satisfied simply with what sustains our present life, not with what pampers it. Let us pray to God for (his, as we have been taught, so that we may keep our souls unenslaved and absolutely free from domination by any of the visible things loved for the sake of the body. Let us show that we eat for the sake of living, and not be guilty of living for the sake of eating. The first is a sign of intelligence, the second proof of its absence. And let us be exact in the way we observe this prayer, thereby showing through our actions that we cleave fast to the one life lived in the spirit alone, and that we use our present life to acquire this spiritual life. We use it, that is to say, only in so far as we do not refuse to sustain our body with bread and to keep it as far as possible in its natural state of good health, our aim being not just to live but to live for God. For we make the body, rendered intelligent by the virtues, a messenger of the soul, and the soul, once it is firmly established in the good, a herald of God; and on the natural plane we restrict our prayer for this bread to one day only, not daring to extend our petition for it to a second day because of Him who gave us the prayer. When we have thus conformed ourselves to the sense of the prayer, we can proceed, in purity to the next petition, saying, 'And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors' (Matt. 6:12).</p>
      <p> According to the first interpretation proposed for the preceding section of the prayer, the words 'this day" symbolize the present age; and the person who prays in this age for the incorruptible bread of wisdom, from which we were cutoff by the original transgression, delights in one thing only: the attaimnent of divme   blessings. It is God</p>
      <p> who by nature bestows these blessings, but it is the recipient's free will that safeguards them. Similarly, such a person knows only</p>
      <p> [V2] 301</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> one pain: the failure to attain these blessings. It is the devil who prompts this failure, but it is the person himself who makes it an actuality, because of his weakness of will with regard to the divine, and because he does not hold fast to</p>
      <p> the precious gift for which he has prayed. But if someone is not in the least concerned with anything in the visible world, and consequently is not overcome by any bodily affliction, then such a person truly and dispassionately forgives those who sin against him: for no one can rob him of the good to which he aspires and which by nature is unassailable.</p>
      <p> A person of this land makes himself a pattern of virtue for God, if it may be put in this way: for by saying 'Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors', he exhorts God, who is beyond imitation, to come and imitate him: and he begs God to treat him as he himself has treated his neighbors. For he wishes to be forgiven by God as he himself has forgiven the debts of those who have sinned against him: hence, just as God dispassionately forgives His creatures, so such a person must himself remain dispassionate in the face of what happens to him and forgive those who offend him. He must not allow the memory of things that afflict him to be stamped on his intellect lest he inwardly sunders human nature by separating himself from some other man, although he is a man himself. When a man's will is in union with: the principle of nature in this way, God and nature are naturally reconciled: but, failing such a union, our nature remains self-divided in its will and cannot receive God's gift of Himself.</p>
      <p> This surely is why God wishes us first to be reconciled with one another. He Himself has no need to learn from us how to be reconciled with sinners and to waive the penalty for a multitude of atrocious crimes: but He wishes to purify us of our passions and show us that the measure of grace conferred on those who are forgiven corresponds to their inward state. It is evident that when man's will is m union with the principle of nature, he is not m a state of rebellion against God. Since the principle of nature is a law both natural and divine, and there is nothing in it contrary to the Logos, when a man's will functions in accordance with this principle it accords with God in all things. Such a condition of the will is an inner state actively characterized by the grace of what is good by nature and hence productive of virtue.</p>
      <p> This, then, is the inner state of the man who prays for Gnostic</p>
      <p> [V2]302</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> bread. After him comes the man who, constrained by nature, seeks ordinary bread, but sufficient for one day only. He will attain the same inner state as the first when he has forgiven his debtors their debts, as he knows that he is by nature mortal. Moreover, by accepting the uncertainty of the future and waiting each day for what is provided by nature, he anticipates nature, choosing to become dead to the world and to comply with the text, 'For Thy sake we are put to death all the day long: we are regarded as sheep for slaughtering' (Ps. 44:22: Rom. 8:36). He makes his</p>
      <p> peace with all in order to be free from all the depravities of this present age when he departs to eternal life, and to receive from the Judge and Savior of the universe a just recompense for what he has done in this life. Both these kinds of men, therefore, need to exhibit a pure disposition towards those who have offended them. This is true in general: but it has particular reference to the concluding words of the prayer: 'And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from what is evil' (Matt. 6:13).</p>
      <p> Scripture reveals in these words that he who has not completely forgiven those who stumble, and has not brought his heart to God free from grievance and illuminated with the light of reconciliation with his neighbor, will fail to attain the grace of the blessings he has prayed for. Indeed, he will justly be handed over to temptation and to evil, so that, having retracted his judgments of other people, he may learn to purify himself of his own sins. Scripture here means by temptation the law of sin, of which the first man was free when he was created. And by 'what is evil' it means the devil, who has mixed this law of sin with human nature, deceitfully persuading man to transfer his soul's desire from what is permitted to what is forbidden, and to turn aside to the transgression of the divine commandment. The result of this is the loss of the incorruptibility which had been given by grace.</p>
      <p> Alternatively, by temptation Scripture means the soul's predilection for the passions of the flesh: and by 'what is evil' the actual way in which this impassioned proclivity is satisfied. The just Judge does not liberate a man from either of these if he has not forgiven his debtors their debts. So long as he prays merely in words for liberation, God. allows him to be defiled by the law of sin: and so long as his will is stubborn and raw. He abandons him to the domination of evil: for he has chosen the shameful passions (cf Rom. 1:26),</p>
      <p> [V2] 303</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> of which the devil is the sower, in preference to nature, of which God is the creator. God leaves him free to incline, if he so wishes, towards the passions of the-flesh, and actually to satisfy that inclination. Valuing the insubstantial passions more highly than nature, in his concern for these passions he has become ignorant of the principle of nature. Had he followed that principle, he would have known what constitutes the law of nature and what the tyranny of the passions - a tyranny brought about, not by nature, but by deliberate choice. He would then have accepted the law of nature that is maintained through activities which are natural: and he would have expelled the tyranny of the passions completely from his will. He would have obeyed nature with his intelligence, for nature in itself is pure and undefiled, faultless, free from hatred and alienation, and he would have made his will once more a companion to nature, totally stripped of everything not bestowed by the principle of nature. In this way he would have eradicated all hatred for and all alienation from what is by nature akm to him, so that when saying this prayer he would be heard and would receive from God a double rather than a single grace: forgiveness for offences already</p>
      <p> committed, and protection and deliverance from those which lie in the future. For he would not be allowed to enter into temptation and to fall into the power of evil for one simple reason: his readiness to forgive his neighbors their debts.</p>
      <p> Thus - to go back a little and comment briefly on what has been said - if we really wish to be delivered from evil and not to enter into temptation, we should trust in God and forgive our debtors their debts. "For if you do not forgive people their sins', says Scripture, 'your heavenly Father will not forgive you yours' (Matt. 6:15). We should do this not only to receive forgiveness for the offences we have committed, but also to defeat the law of sin -because then we would not be allowed to undergo the experience of bemg tempted by it - and to trample on the originator of this law, the evil serpent from whom we entreat God to deliver us. For Christ, who has overcome the world (cf. John 16:33), is our leader. He arms us with the laws of the commandments, and by enabling us to reject the passions He unites us m pure love with nature itself. Being the bread of life, of wisdom, spiritual knowledge and righteousness. He arouses in us an insatiable desire for Himself If we fulfill His Father's will He makes us co-worshippers with the</p>
      <p> [V2] 304</p>
      <p> St Maximos the Confessor</p>
      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> angels, when in our conduct we imitate them as we should and so conform to the heavenly state. Then He leads us up still further on the supreme ascent of divine truth to the Father of lights, and makes us share in the divine nature (cf. 2 Pet. 1:4) through participation by grace in the Holy Spirit. By virtue of this participation we are called children of God and, cleansed from all stain, in a manner beyond circumscription, we all encircle Him who is the author of this grace and by nature the Son of the Father. From Him, through Him and in Him we have and always will have our being, our movement and our life (cf. Acts 17:28).</p>
      <p> When we pray, let our aim be this mystery of deification, which shows us what we were once like and what the self-emptying of the only-begotten Son through the flesh has now made us; which shows us, that is, the depths to which we were dragged down by the weight of sin, and the heights to which we have been raised by His compassionate hand. In this way we shall come to have greater love for Him who has prepared this salvation for us with such wisdom. Bringing the prayer to fulfillment through our actions, we shall manifestly proclaim God as our true Father, by grace. We shall show that the evil one, who is always tyrannically attempting to gain control of our nature through the shameful passions, is not the father of our life, and that we are not unwittingly exchanging life for death. For both God and the devil naturally impart their qualities to those who approach either of them: God bestows eternal life on those who love Him, while the devil, operating through temptations that we subject to our volition, causes the death of his followers.</p>
      <p> For according to Scripture there are two kinds of temptation, one pleasurable, the other painful. One is the result of deliberate choice: the other is unsought. The first kind generates sin. We have been commanded by the Lord's teaching to pray not to fall into this, for He says, "Lead us not into temptation" (Matt. 6:13), and 'Watch and pray so that you do not enter into temptation' (Matt. 26:41). The other kind of temptation punishes sin, chastising a sin-loving disposition with sufferings that are unsought. To the person who endures this kind of temptation - which comes in the form of a trial - and who in particular is not riveted to evil, the words of the apostle James may be applied: 'My brethren, regard it as a great joy whenever you find yourselves beset by many trials; because the testing of your faith produces patient endurance; this endurance</p>

      <p> On the Lord's Prayer</p>
      <p> shapes the character; and the character thus shaped should be brought to fruition' (cf. Jas. 1:2-4: Rom. 5:4). The evil one works his malice both through the temptation that is subject to our volition and through the trial that comes unsought. Where the first is concerned, by sowing the soul with bodily pleasures and by exciting it in this manner, he contrives to divert its desire away from divine love. Where the trial is concerned, in his wish to destroy nature through pain, he cunningly tries to force the soul, enervated by its sufferings, to calumniate and abuse the Creator.</p>
      <p> But, knowing the wiles of the evil one, let us pray for deliverance from the temptations subject to our volition, so that we do not defied our desire from divine love; and let us bravely endure the trials that come unsought, since they visit us with God's consent and by enduring them we show that we have not put nature before the Creator of nature. May all of us who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ be delivered from the present delights and the future afflictions of the evil one by participating in the reality of the blessings held in store and already revealed to us in Christ our Lord Himself, who alone with the Father and the Holy Spirit is praised by all creation. Amen.</p>

      <p> Inroductory Note</p>
      <p> St Thalassios, priest and abbot at a monastery in Libya, was a personal friend of St Maximos the Confessor, whose</p>
      <p> largest work.  To Thalassios: On J'arious Questions relating to Holy Scripture,  consists of answers to difficulties raised by St Thalassios. The  Two Hundred Texts on Theology  by St Maximos are also dedicated to St Thalassios, and in addition five of St Maximos' letters are addressed to him.^ Twice St Maximos describes himself as a disciple of St Thalassios." Perhaps this is no more than an expression of courtesy towards someone older than himself, and it may have been St Thalassios who was in reality the disciples but it is not impossible that St Maximos was indeed decisively influenced by him."*</p>
      <p> The four centuries here translated are the only known work of the Libyan abbot. They display at many points the influence of Evagrios, but lay greater emphasis upon the integral unity of body and soul. St Thalassios, like St Maximos, sees self-love as the source of all the vices, and the two agree in emphasizing the supreme importance of love.</p>
      <p> In the church calendar St Thalassios is commemorated on 20 May. For the present translation the Greek text in the  Philokalia  has been compared with that in Migne, P.G. xci, 1427-70, which is often more reliable.</p>

      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> 1.   An all-embracing and intense longing for God binds those who experience it both to God and to one another.</p>
      <p> 2.  An intellect that has acquired spiritual love does not have thoughts unworthy of this love about anyone.</p>
      <p> 4.    He who has acquired love endures calmly and patiently the injuries and sufferings that his enemies inflict on him.</p>
      <p> 5.  Love alone harmoniously joins all created things with God and with each other.</p>
      <p> 6.  A person who does not tolerate suspicion or disparagement of others possesses true love.</p>
      <p> 7.  He who does nothing to dispel love is precious in the sight of God and among men.</p>
      <p> 8.  True words from a pure conscience betoken unfeigned love.</p>
      <p> 9.   If you tell your brother how someone else denigrates him you conceal your own envy in the guise of goodwill.</p>
      <p> 10.  Worldly virtues promote human glory, spiritual virtues the glory of God.</p>
      <p> 11.  Love and self-control purify the soul, while pure prayer illumines the intellect.</p>
      <p> 12.  A strong man is one who repels evil through the practice of the virtues and with spiritual knowledge.</p>

      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> 13.  He who has acquired dispassion and spiritual knowledge has been granted God's grace.</p>
      <p> 14.  If you wish to overcome impassioned thoughts, acquire self-control and love for your neighbor.</p>
      <p> 15.  Guard yourself from hatred and dissipation, and you will not be impeded at the time of prayer.</p>
      <p> 18.  Inner work destroys self-esteem, and if you despise no one you will repel pride.</p>
      <p> 19.  The signs of self-esteem are hypocrisy and falsehood; those of pride are presumption and jealousy.</p>
      <p> 20.  The true ruler is he who rales over himself and has subjected soul and body to the intelligence.</p>
      <p> 21.  The genuineness of a friend is shown at a time of trial, if he shares the distress you suffer.</p>
      <p> 22.  Seal your senses with stillness and sit in judgment upon the thoughts that attack your heart.</p>
      <p> 23.  Respond without rancor to thoughts of dejection, but oppose thoughts of self-indulgence with enmity.</p>
      <p> 24.  Stillness, prayer, love and self-control are a four-horsed chariot bearing the intellect to heaven.</p>
      <p> 25.  Waste your body with fasting and vigils, and you will repulse the lethal thoughts of pleasure.</p>
      <p> 26.  As wax melts before fire, so does an impure thought before the fear of God.</p>
      <p> 27.  The intelligent soul is greatly harmed when it dallies with an ignoble passion.</p>
      <p> 28.  Patiently endure the distressing and painful things that befall you, for through them God in His providence is purifying you.</p>
      <p> 29.  Now that you have renounced toe world and material things, renounce evil thoughts as well.</p>
      <p> 30.  The proper activity of the intellect is to be attentive at every moment to the words of God.</p>
      <p> 31.  It is God's task to administer the world and the soul's task to guide the body.</p>

      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> 32.  With what hope will we meet Christ if we are still enslaved to the pleasures of the flesh?</p>
      <p> 33.  Hardship and distress, whether of our own choosing or providential, destroy sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> 34.  The amassing of money fuels the passions, for it leads to increasing indulgence in all kinds of sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> 35.  The failure to secure sensual pleasure breeds dejection, while sensual pleasure itself is linked with all the passions.</p>
      <p> 36.  How God treats you depends upon how you treat your body.</p>
      <p> 37.  God's justice is a fair requital for what we have done through our bodies.</p>
      <p> 38.  Virtue and spiritual knowledge lead to immortality, their absence is the mother of death.</p>
      <p> 39.  Distress that accords with God's will puts an end to sensual pleasure, and the destruction of such pleasure is the soul's resurrection.</p>
      <p> 40.  Dispassion is a state in which the soul does not yield to any evil impulse, and it can be realized only through Christ's mercy.</p>
      <p> 41.  Christ is the savior of both soul and body, and the person who follows in His footsteps is freed from evil.</p>
      <p> 42.  If you wish to attain salvation, renounce sensual pleasure and learn self-control, love and how to pray with concentration.</p>
      <p> 43.  The mark of dispassion is true discrimination: for one who has attained the state of dispassion does all things with discrimination and according to measure and rule.</p>
      <p> 44.  Our Lord and God is Jesus Christ, and the intellect that follows Him will not remain in darkness (cf John 12;46).</p>
      <p> 45.  Concentrate your intellect, keep watch over your thoughts, and fight with any of them that are impassioned.</p>
      <p> 46.   There are three ways through which thoughts arise in you: through the senses, through the memory, and through the body's temperament. Of these the most irksome are those that come through the memory.</p>
      <p> 47.  The man to whom wisdom has been given knows the inward essences of immaterial things and what is the origin and consummation of the world.</p>
      <p> 48.  Do not neglect the practice of the virtues and your intellect will be illumined; for it is written, 'I will open for you invisible secret treasures' (Isa. 45:3. LXX).</p>
      <p> [V2] 310</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> 49.  The man freed from his passions has been granted God's grace, and if: he has been found worthy of spiritual knowledge he has received great mercy.</p>
      <p> 50.  The intellect freed from the passions becomes like light, unceasingly illumined by the contemplation of created beings.</p>
      <p> 51.  Holy knowledge is the light of the soul; bereft of it, 'the fool walks in darkness' (Eccles. 2:14).</p>
      <p> 52.  The man who lives in darkness is a fool, and the murk of ignorance awaits him.</p>
      <p> 54.  The intellect freed from the passions forms conceptual images that are also passion-free, whether the body is asleep or awake.</p>
      <p> 55.  The completely purified intellect is cramped by created beings and longs to go beyond them.</p>
      <p> 56.  Blessed is he who has attained boundless infinity, transcending all that is transitory.</p>
      <p> 57.  He who stands in awe of God searches for the divine principles that God has implanted in creation: the lover of truth finds them.</p>
      <p> 58 Rightly motivated, the intellect will find the truth; but motivated by passion it will miss the mark.</p>
      <p> 59.  As God is unknowable in His essence, so is He infinite in His majesty.</p>
      <p> 60.  God, whose essence is without origin or consummation, is also impenetrable in His wisdom.</p>
      <p> 61.  The sublime providence of the Creator preserves everything that is.</p>
      <p> 62.  In his mercy the Lord supports all who fall, and raises up all who are bowed down' (Ps. 145:14).</p>
      <p> 63.  Christ in His justice rewards the living, the dead, and every single action.</p>
      <p> 64.  If you wish to be in control of your soul and body, forestall the passions by rooting out their causes.</p>
      <p> 65.  Yoke the powers of the soul to the virtues and they will be freed from the tyranny of the passions.</p>
      <p> 66.   Curb the impulses of desire by means of self-control and those of anger with spiritual love. [V2] 311</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> 67.  Stillness and prayer are the greatest weapons of virtue, for they purify the intellect and confer on it spiritual insight.</p>
      <p> 68.  Only spiritual .conversation is beneficial; it is better to preserve stillness than to indulge in any other kind.</p>
      <p> 69.  Of the five kinds of conversation choose the first three, be sparing of the fourth, and avoid the fifth.</p>
      <p> 70.   The person who is unaffected by the things of this world loves stillness; and he who loves no human thing loves all men.</p>
      <p> 71.  The conscience is a true teacher, and whoever listens to it will not stumble.</p>
      <p> 72.  Only those who have reached the extremes of virtue or of evil are not judged by their consciences.</p>
      <p> 73.  Total dispassion renders our conceptual images passion-free: perfect spiritual knowledge brings us into the presence of Him who is utterly beyond knowledge.</p>
      <p> 74.  Failure to obtain pleasure induces a culpable kind of distress he who scorns pleasure is free from distress.</p>
      <p> 75.  In general, distress arises from the privation of pleasure, whether it be of a worldly kind or relate to God.</p>
      <p> 76.  Kingship, goodness and wisdom belong to God; he who attains them dwells in heaven.</p>
      <p> 77.  The person who in his actions shows that he prefers his body to his soul, and the world to God, is a pathetic creature.</p>
      <p> 78.  He who does not envy the spiritually mature and is merciful to the wicked has attained an equal love for all.</p>
      <p> 79.  The person who applies the laws of virtue to soul and body is truly fit to rule.</p>
      <p> 80.  Spiritual commerce consists in being detached equally from the pleasures and the pains of this life for the sake of the blessings held in store.</p>
      <p> 8L Love and self-control strengthen the soul: pure prayer and contemplation, the intellect.</p>
      <p> 82.  When you hear something to your benefit, do not condemn the speaker; for if you do you will nullify his helpful admonition.</p>
      <p> 83.  A depraved mind thmks evil thoughts and regards as defects the achievements of a neighbor.</p>
      <p> 84.  Do not trust a thought that would judge your neighbor: for it is the man who is a storehouse of evil that thinks evil thoughts (cf Matt. 12:35).</p>
      <p> [V2] 312</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> First Century</p>
      <p> 85.  A good heart produces good thoughts: its thoughts correspond to what it stores up in itself.</p>
      <p> 86.   Keep watch over your thoughts and shun evil. Then your intellect will not be darkened but, on the contrary, will see.</p>
      <p> 87.  Bear in mind the Jews and watch yourself carefully; for the Jews were blinded with jealousy and took Beelzebub for their Lord and God (cf Matt. 12:24).</p>
      <p> 88.  An evil suspicion darkens the mind (cf. Ecclus. 3:24) and diverts attention from the path to what lies beside it.</p>
      <p> 89.  To each virtue there is an opposing vice; hence the wicked take vices for virtues.</p>
      <p> 90.  If the mtellect dallies with pleasure or dejection, it rapidly succumbs to the passion of listlessness.</p>
      <p> 91.  A pure conscience rouses the soul, but an impure thought debases it.</p>
      <p> 94.  An intellect that gives itself over to God in prayer frees the soul's passible aspect from the passions.</p>
      <p> 95.  God, who gave being to all that is, at the same time united all things together in His providence.</p>
      <p> 96.  Being Master, He became a servant, and so revealed to the world the depths of His providence.</p>
      <p> 97.   God the Logos, in becoming incarnate while remaining unchanged, was united through His flesh with the whole of creation.</p>
      <p> 98.  There is a new wonder in heaven and on earth: God is on earth and man is in heaven.</p>
      <p> 99.  He united men and angels so as to bestow deification on all creation.</p>
      <p> 100.  The knowledge of the holy and coessential Trinity is the sanctification and deification of men and angels.</p>
      <p> 101.  Forgiveness of sms is betokened by freedom from the passions; he who has not yet been granted freedom from the passions has not yet received forgiveness.</p>

      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> 1.  If you want to be freed from all the vices simultaneously, renounce self-love, the mother of evils.</p>
      <p> 2.  The soul's health consists in dispassion and spiritual knowledge: no slave to sensual pleasure can attain it.</p>
      <p> 3.  Patient self-control and long-suffering love dry up the pleasures of soul and body.</p>
      <p> 5.  The intelligence by nature submits to the Logos and disciplines and subjugates the body.</p>
      <p> 6.  It is an insult to the intelligence to be subject to what lacks intelligence and to concern itself with shameful desires.</p>
      <p> 7.  For the deiform soul to abandon the Creator and worship the body is an act of depravity.</p>
      <p> 8.  You were commanded to keep the body as a servant, not to be unnaturally enslaved to its pleasures.</p>
      <p> 9.  Break the bonds of your friendship for the body and give it only what is absolutely necessary.</p>
      <p> 10.  Enclose your senses in the citadel of stillness so that they do not involve the intellect in then' desires.</p>
      <p> 11.  The greatest weapons of someone striving to lead a life of inward stillness are self-control, love, prayer and spiritual reading.</p>
      <p> 12.  The intellect will go on looking for sensual pleasure until you subjugate the flesh and devote yourself to contemplation.</p>
      <p> 13.   Let us strive to fulfill the commandments so that we may be freed from the passions; and let us struggle to grasp divme doctrine so that we may be found worthy of spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 14.   The soul's immortality resides in dispassion and spiritual knowledge; no slave to sensual pleasure can attain it. [V2] 314</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> 15.  Subjugate your body, strip it of sensual pleasures, and free it from base servitude.</p>
      <p> 17.  The demons bind the intellect to sensible things by means of desire and fear, distress and sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> 18.  Fear of the Lord conquers desire, and distress that accords with God's will repulses sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> 19.  Desire for wisdom scorns fear, and the delight of spiritual knowledge expels distress.</p>
      <p> 20.  The Scriptures contain four things: commandments, doctrines, threats and promises.</p>
      <p> 21.  Self-control and strenuous effort curb desire; stillness and intense longing for God wither it.</p>
      <p> 22.  Do not goad your brother with obscure words; you would not put up with similar treatment at his hands.</p>
      <p> 23.  Long-suffering and readiness to forgive curb anger; love and compassion wither it.</p>
      <p> 24.  If you have been given spiritual knowledge, you have been given noetic light; should you dishonor that light, you will see darkness.</p>
      <p> 25.  The  keeping   of  God's   commandments   generates   dispassion;   the   soul's   dispassion  preserves   spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 26.  Contemplate sensible objects noetically and you will raise your sense-perception above the realm of such objects.</p>
      <p> 27.  Woman symbolizes the soul engaged in ascetic practice; through union with it the Intellect begets the virtues.</p>
      <p> 28.  The study of divine principles teaches knowledge of God to the person who lives in truth, longing and reverence.</p>
      <p> 29.  What light is to those who see and to what is seen, God is to intellective beings and to what is intelligible.</p>
      <p> 30.  The sensible firmament symbolizes the firmament of faith in which all the saints shine like stars.</p>
      <p> 31.  Jerusalem is the celestial knowledge of immaterial beings; within it the vision of peace can be contemplated.</p>
      <p> 32.  Do not neglect the practice of the virtues; if you do, your spiritual knowledge will decrease, and when famine occurs you will go down into Egypt (cf Gen. 41:57; 46:6).</p>
      <p> 33.  Spiritual freedom is release from the passions; without Christ's mercy you cannot attain it.</p>
      <p> [V2] 315</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> 34.  The promised land is the kingdom of heaven whose ambassadors are dispassion and spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 35.  The Egypt of the spirit is the darkness of the passions; no one goes down to Egypt unless he is overtaken by famine.</p>
      <p> 36.  If you make a habit of listening to spiritual teaching, your intellect will escape from impure thoughts.</p>
      <p> 37.  God alone is good and wise by nature; but if you exert yourself your intellect also becomes good and wise through participation.</p>
      <p> 38.   Control your stomach, sleep, anger and tongue, and you will not "dash your foot against .a stoneXPs. 91: 12).</p>
      <p> 39.  Strive to love every man equally, and you will simultaneously expel all the passions.</p>
      <p> 40.  The contemplation of sensible thmgs is shared by the intellect and the senses; but the knowledge of intelligible realities pertains to the intellect alone.</p>
      <p> 41.  The intellect cannot devote itself to intelligible realities unless you sunder its attachment to the senses and to sensible things.</p>
      <p> 43.  Devote your senses to the service of the intellect and give them no time to be diverted from it.</p>
      <p> 44.  When the intellect gives its attention to sensible objects, withdraw your senses from them, bringing the objects into direct contact with the intellect.</p>
      <p> 45.  A sign that the intellect is devoted to the contemplation of intelligible realities is its disdain for all that agitates the senses.</p>
      <p> 46.  When the intellect is engaged in the contemplation of intelligible realities, its delight in them is such that it can hardly be dragged away.</p>
      <p> 47.  When the intellect is rich in the knowledge of the One, the senses will be completely under control.</p>
      <p> 48.  Prevent your intellect from pursuing sensible things, so that it does not reap the fruits of pleasure and pain which they produce.</p>
      <p> 49.  When the intellect devotes itself continually to divine realities, the soul's passible aspect becomes a godlike weapon.</p>
      <p> 50.   The intellect cannot be transformed by spiritual knowledge unless it first detaches itself from the soul's passible aspect by means of its own virtues.</p>
      <p> [V2]316</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> 51.  The intellect becomes a stranger to the things of this world when its attachment to the senses has been completely sundered.</p>
      <p> 52.  The proper function of  the  soul's intelligent aspect is devotion to the knowledge of God, while that of its passible aspect is the pursuit of self-control and love.</p>
      <p> 53.  The intellect cannot dally with any sensible object unless it entertains at least some kind of passionate feeling for it.</p>
      <p> 54.  The intellect is perfect when transformed by spiritual knowledge; the soul is perfect when permeated by the virtues.</p>
      <p> 55.  The intellect's attachment to the senses enslaves it to bodily pleasure.</p>
      <p> 56.  The intellect falls from the realm of spiritual knowledge when the soul's passible aspect abandons its own virtues.</p>
      <p> 57.  Although we have received the power to become the children of God (cf John 1:12), we do not actually attain this sonship unless we strip ourselves of the passions.</p>
      <p> 58.  Let no one think that he has actually become a child of God if he has not yet acquired divine qualities.</p>
      <p> 59.  We are sons of God or of Satan according to whether we conform to goodness or to evil.</p>
      <p> 60.  A wise man is one who pays attention to himself and is quick to separate himself from all defilement.</p>
      <p> 61.  An obdurate soul does not notice when it is whipped and so is unaware of its benefactor.</p>
      <p> 62.  A soiled garment excludes one from the divine wedding feast and makes one a communicant of outer darkness (cf Matt. 22:12-13).</p>
      <p> 63.  He who fears God will pay careful attention to his soul and will free himself from communion with evil.</p>
      <p> 64.  If you abandon God and are a slave to the passions you cannot reap God's mercy.</p>
      <p> 65.   Even if we do not wish to believe Him, it was Jesus who said that no one can serve two masters (cf. Matt. 6:24).</p>
      <p> 66.   A soul defiled by the passions becomes obdurate: it has to undergo knife and cautery before it recovers its faith.</p>
      <p> 67.  Fearful afflictions await the hard of heart, for without great sufferings they cannot become pliable and responsive.</p>
      <p> 68. A wise man pays careful attention to himself, and by freely choosing to suffer escapes the suffering that comes unsought.</p>
      <p> [V2] 317</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> 69.  Concern for one's soul means hardship and humility, for through these God forgives us all our sins.</p>
      <p> 70.  Just as desire and rage-multiply our sins, so self-control and humility erase them.</p>
      <p> 71.  Distress that accords with God's will shatters the heart, it is produced by the fear of punishment.</p>
      <p> 72.  Such distress purifies the heart, expelling from it the defilements of sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> 73.   Patient endurance is the soul's struggle for virtue; where there is struggle for virtue, self-indulgence is banished.</p>
      <p> 74.  All sin is due to sensual pleasure, all forgiveness to hardship and distress.</p>
      <p> 75.  If you are not willing to repent through freely choosing to suffer, unsought sufferings will providentially be imposed on you.</p>
      <p> 76.  Christ is the Savior of the whole world, and has conferred on men the gift of repentance so that they may be saved.</p>
      <p> 77.  Repentance engenders the keeping of the commandments, and this in its turn purifies the soul.</p>
      <p> 78.  The purification of the soul is release from the passions, and release from the passions gives birth to love.</p>
      <p> 81.  Make the body serve the commandments, keeping it so far as possible free from sickness and sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> 82.  The flesh revolts when prayer, frugality and blessed stillness are neglected.</p>
      <p> 83.  Blessed stillness gives birth to blessed children: self-control, love and pure prayer.</p>
      <p> 84.  Spiritual reading and prayer purify the intellect, while love and self-control purify the soul's passible aspect.</p>
      <p> 85.  Always keep the same measure of self-control; otherwise through irregularity you will go from one extreme to another.</p>
      <p> 86.  If you lay down mles for yourself, do not disobey yourself; for he who cheats himself is self-deluded.</p>
      <p> 87.  The soul filled with passion lies in noetic darkness, for in such a soul the sun of righteousness has set.</p>
      <p> [V2]318</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Second Century</p>
      <p> 88.  A son of God is a person who through wisdom, power and righteousness has become like God.</p>
      <p> 89.  The soul's disease is an evil disposition'^ while its death is sin put into action.</p>
      <p> 90.   Spiritual poverty is complete dispassion; when the intellect has reached this state it abandons all worldly things.</p>
      <p> 91.  Preserve the harmony of the soul's virtues, and it will bring forth the fruit of righteousness.</p>
      <p> 93.   Just as the four elements are a combination of matter and form, so the bodies that derive from them are likewise made up of matter and form.</p>
      <p> 94.  When in His compassion for man the Logos became flesh. He changed neither what He was nor what He became.</p>
      <p> 95.  Just as we speak of the one Christ as being 'from Godhead' and 'from manhood' and 'in Godhead' and 'in manhood", so we speak of Him as being 'from two natures' and "in two natures'.</p>
      <p> 96.  We confess that in Christ there is a single hypostasis, or subject, in two indivisibly united natures.</p>
      <p> 97.  We glorify the one indivisible hypostasis of Christ and confess the union without confusion of the two natures.</p>
      <p> 98.   We venerate the one essence of the Divinity in three Persons, or hypostases, and confess the coessential Trinity.</p>
      <p> 99.  Particular to the three Persons are fatherhood, sonship and procession. Common to them are essence, nature, divinity and goodness.</p>

      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> 1.  Think good thoughts about what is good by nature, and think well of every man.</p>
      <p> 2.  On the day of judgment we shall be asked by God to answer for our words, acts and thoughts.</p>
      <p> 3.  Whether we think, speak or act in a good or an evil manner depends upon whether we cleave inwardly to virtue</p>
      <p> or to vice.</p>
      <p> 4.  An intellect dominated by the passions thinks base thoughts; words and actions bring these thoughts into the open.</p>
      <p> 5.  An evil thought is preceded by passion. The passion is caused by the senses, but the misuse of the senses is clearly the fault of the intellect.</p>
      <p> 6.  Shut out the senses, fight against prepossession and, with the commandments as your weapons, destroy the passions.</p>
      <p> 7.  Inveterate wickedness requires long practice of the virtues; for an engrained habit is not easily uprooted.</p>
      <p> 8.  The forceful practice of self-control and love, patience and stillness, will destroy the passions hidden within us.</p>
      <p> 9.  Impel your intellect continually to prayer and you will destroy the evil thoughts that beset your heart.</p>
      <p> 10.  Ascetic practice requires long and patient endurance: assiduous struggle will slowly root out self-indulgence.</p>
      <p> 11.  You will not find the rigors of the ascetic life hard to bear if you do all things with measure and by rule.</p>
      <p> 12.  Maintain a regular level of ascetic practice and do not break your rule unless forced to do so.</p>
      <p> 13.  Just as love and self-control destroy evil thought so contemplation and prayer destroy all self-exaltation.</p>
      <p> 14.  Ascetic struggle - fasting, vigils, patience, forbearance -produces a clear conscience.</p>
      <p> [V2] 320</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> 15.  He who patiently endures unsought trials becomes humble, full of hope and spiritually mature.</p>
      <p> 16.  Patient endurance is a continuous effort for the soul; it is bom of suffering freely chosen and of trials that come unsought.</p>
      <p> 17.  Perseverance in the face of adversity dissolves evil, while unremitting patience destroys it utterly.</p>
      <p> 18.  The experience of suffering afflicts the senses: distress annuls sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> 19.  There are four prevalent passions which God in His wisdom sets one against the other.</p>
      <p> 20.  Distress checks sensual pleasure; the fear of punishment withers desire.</p>
      <p> 21.  The wise intellect tests the soul and trains the body with all kinds of ascetic practice.</p>
      <p> 22.  Prove yourself a monk, not outwardly, but inwardly, by freeing yourself from the passions.</p>
      <p> 23.  The first renunciation is that of material things, the second that of the passions, the third that of ignorance.</p>
      <p> 24.  It is not difficult to get rid of material things if you so desire; but only with great effort will you be able to get rid of thoughts about them.</p>
      <p> 25.  Control desire and you will dominate anger; for desire gives rise to anger.</p>
      <p> 26.  We may have freed ourselves from impassioned thoughts; but have we yet been granted pure and immaterial prayer?</p>
      <p> 27.  Great is the intellect that is freed from the passions, has separated itself from created beings, and lives in God.</p>
      <p> 28.  The person advancing in the spiritual life studies three things: the commandments, doctrine, and faith in the Holy Trinity.</p>
      <p> the contemplation of created beings, and its own light.</p>
      <p> 30.  The foulest passions ore bidden within our souls; they are brought to light only when we scrutinize our actions.</p>
      <p> 31.  Sometimes the intellect that has attained a partial dispassion will remain undisturbed; but this is because, in the absence of the things that provoke it, it is not put to the test.</p>
      <p> 32.   As has been said, our passions are roused through these [V2] 321</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> three things: the memory, the body's temperament, and the senses.</p>
      <p> 33.  The intellect that has shut out the senses, and has achieved a balance in the body's temperament, has to fight only against its memories.</p>
      <p> 34.  It is when self-control and spiritual love are missing that the passions are roused by the senses.</p>
      <p> 35.  Moderate fasting, vigils and psalmody are natural means for achieving a balance in the body's temperament.</p>
      <p> 36.  Three things upset the balance of the body's temperament: lack of restraint in our diet, a change in the weather, and the touch of the demonic powers.</p>
      <p> 37.  Our memories can be stripped of passion through prayer, spiritual reading, self-control and love.</p>
      <p> 38.   First shut out the senses through the practice of stillness and then fight against your memories by cultivating the virtues.</p>
      <p> 40.  To misuse conceptual images and material things is to use them in a profane and improper manner.</p>
      <p> 41.  Reprehensible passions chain the intellect, binding it to sensible objects.</p>
      <p> 42.  The person who is not affected either by material things, or by his memories of them, has attained perfect dispassion.</p>
      <p> 43.  A saint-like soul helps its neighbor and when ill-treated by him is patient, enduring what it suffers at his hands.</p>
      <p> 44.  Malicious thoughts are a fully existent form of evil: if you do not get rid of them you will not become a disciple of spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 45.  The person who listens to Christ fills himself with light; and if he imitates Christ, he reclaims himself.</p>
      <p> 46.  Rancor is the soul's leprosy. The soul contracts it as the result of disgrace or punishment, or because of suspicious thoughts.</p>
      <p> 47.  The Lord blinds the intellect that is jealous and resentful of its neighbor's blessings.</p>
      <p> 48.  The tongue of a back-biting soul is three-pronged: it injures the speaker, the listener and sometimes the person being maligned.</p>
      <p> 49.   He who prays for those who offend him is without rancor; and the unstinting giver is set free from it. [V2] 322</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> 50.  Hatred-for one's neighbor soul's death; the back-biting soul both suffers and inflicts such death.</p>
      <p> 52.  He who loves Jesus trains himself in suffering: perseverance in suffering dispels listlessness.</p>
      <p> 53.  The soul is strengthened through ascetic suffering, and dispels listlessness by doing all things according to measure.</p>
      <p> 54.  Control of the belly withers desire and keeps the intellect free from lecherous thoughts.</p>
      <p> 55.  An intellect in control of itself is the temple of the Holy Spirit, but that of a glutton is like a nest of crows.</p>
      <p> 56.  A surfeit of foods breeds desire; a deficiency sweetens even plain bread.</p>
      <p> 57.   If you share secretly in the joy of someone you envy, you will be freed from your jealousy; and you will also be freed from your jealousy if you keep silent about the person you envy.</p>
      <p> 58.   Shun whoever lives dissolutely, even if many hold him in high esteem.</p>
      <p> 59.  Make a friend of the man who works hard and you will find protection.</p>
      <p> 60.  The dissolute man is sold to many masters and lives his life in whatever way they lead him.</p>
      <p> 61.  Such a man will treat you as a friend in the time of peace, but in the time of trial he will fight you as an enemy.</p>
      <p> 62.  When his passions are quiescent, he will lay down his life for you; when they are roused, he will take it back again.</p>
      <p> 63.  A dissolute soul is as full of impure passions as waste land is full of thistles.</p>
      <p> 64.  A wise intellect restrains the soul, keeps the body in subjection, and makes the passions its servants.</p>
      <p> 65.  Our actions disclose what goes on within us, just as its fruit makes known a tree otherwise unknown to us.</p>
      <p> 66.  The hypocrite, like the false prophet, is betrayed by his words and actions.</p>
      <p> 67.  An intellect that does not use its intelligence fails to chastise the soul, and so prevents it from acquiring love and self-control.</p>
      <p> 68.   The cause of depraved thoughts is an evil disposition made up of pride and boastfulness. [V2] 323</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> 69.  Pride and boastfulness are characterized by hypocrisy, guile, trickery, pretence and, worst of all, falsity.</p>
      <p> 70.  These characteristics are aided and abetted by envy, strife, anger, resentment and rancor.</p>
      <p> 71.  Such is the state of those who live dissolutely, and such are the treasures hidden in my heart (cf Matt. 12:35).</p>
      <p> 72.  Hardship and humility save the soul and free it from all the passions.</p>
      <p> 73.  A helpful word indicates an understanding mind; a good action reveals a saint-like soul.</p>
      <p> 74.  An illumined intellect brings forth words of wisdom; a pure soul cultivates godlike thoughts.</p>
      <p> 75.  The thoughts of a wise man are devoted to wisdom, and his words enlighten those who hear them.</p>
      <p> 76.  A virtuous soul cultivates good thoughts; a soul full of evil breeds thoughts of depravity.</p>
      <p> 77.  An impassioned soul produces evil thoughts: it is a fund of evil.</p>
      <p> 78.  The virtues possess a fund of goodness from which the holy intellect brings forth blessings.</p>
      <p> produces diabolic thoughts.</p>
      <p> 80.  When the inteUect is moved by love for its neighbor, it always thinks well of him: but when it is under diabolic influence it entertains evil thoughts about him.</p>
      <p> 81.  The virtues generate good thoughts; the commandments lead us to the virtues; the practice of the virtues depends on our own will and resolution.</p>
      <p> 82.  As virtue and evil come and go, they dispose the soul either to goodness or to malice, prompting in it the corresponding thoughts.</p>
      <p> 83.  Evil begets evil thoughts; disobedience begets evil; the deceit of the senses gives, rise to disobedience; and this deceit derives from the intellect's neglect of its own salvation.</p>
      <p> 84.   In the case of those advancing on the spiritual way, their attitude to good and evil is easily changed; but in those who have achieved perfection it is hard to shift.</p>
      <p> 85.  The soul's strength is its firm state of virtue; on reaching</p>
      <p> [V2] 324</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Third Century</p>
      <p> such a state one may say with the invincible apostle Paul; 'What can separate us from the love of Christ?" (Rom. 8:35).</p>
      <p> 86.  Self-love precedes all the passions, while last of all comes pride,</p>
      <p> 87.  The three most common forms of desire have their origin in the passion of self-love.</p>
      <p> though they do not all follow each of them.</p>
      <p> The thought of unchastity follows that of gluttony; of pride, that of self-esteem. The others all follow the three most common forms.</p>
      <p> 90.  Thus thoughts of resentment, anger, rancor, envy, listless-ness and the rest all follow these three most common forms.</p>
      <p> A Prayer</p>
      <p> 91.  Christ, Master of all, free us from all these destructive passions and the thoughts bom of them.</p>
      <p> 92.  For Thy sake we came into being, so that we might delight in the paradise which Thou hast planted and in which Thou hast placed us.</p>
      <p> 93.  We brought our present disgrace upon ourselves, preferring destruction to the delights of blessedness.</p>
      <p> 94.  We have paid for this, for we have exchanged eternal life for death.</p>
      <p> 95.  0 Master, as once Thou hast looked on us, look on us now; as Thou becamest man, save all of us.</p>
      <p> 96.  For Thou camest to save us who were lost. Do not exclude us from the company of those who are being saved.</p>
      <p> 97.  Raise up our souls and save our bodies, cleansing us from all impurity.</p>
      <p> 98.  Break the fetters of the passions that constrain us, as once Thou hast broken the ranks of the impure demons.</p>
      <p> 99.  Free us from their tyranny, so that we may worship Thee alone, the eternal light.</p>
      <p> lOO.Havmg risen from the dead and dancing with the angels in the blessed, eternal and indissoluble dance. Amen.</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> 1.  The person who has broken the bonds of his inteUect's fawning friendship for the flesh has slain the body's evil acts through the life-giving Spirit.</p>
      <p> 2.  Do not think that the intellect is free from its attachment to the flesh so long as it is still troubled by the activities that pertain to the flesh.</p>
      <p> 3.  Just as the senses and sensible objects pertain to the flesh, so the intellect and intelligible realities pertain to the soul.</p>
      <p> 4.  Withdraw your soul from the perception of sense objects, and the intellect will find itself in God and in the realm of intelligible realities.</p>
      <p> 5.   Intelligible natures that can be grasped only by the intellect belong to the realm of divinity, while the senses and sense objects have been created for the service of the intellect.</p>
      <p> 6.  Use the senses and sense objects as a means to spiritual contemplation but, on the contrary, do not use what provokes the desire of the flesh as food for the senses.</p>
      <p> 7.  You have been commanded to mortify the acts of the body (cf. Col. 3:5) so that when the soul has been made dead to pleasure you may bring it back to life through your ascetic labors.</p>
      <p> 8.   Be ruled by God and rule over your senses; and, being on a higher level, do not give authority to what is inferior to you.</p>
      <p> 9.  God, who is eternal, limitless and infinite, has promised eternal, limitless and inexpressible blessings to those who obey him.</p>
      <p> 1L  You have the power to inchne either upwards or downwards: choose what is superior and you wiU bring what is inferior into subjection.</p>
      <p> [V2] 326</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> 12.  Because they are the works of God, who is Himself good, the senses and sensible objects are good; but they cannot m any way be compared with the intellect and with intelligible realities.</p>
      <p> 13.  The Lord has created intelligent and noetic beings with a capacity to receive the Spirit and to attain knowledge of Himself; He has brought into existence the senses and sense objects to serve such beings.</p>
      <p> 14.  Just as it is absurd to subject a good master to a worthless servant, so it is absurd to subject the deifomi intellect to the corruptible body.</p>
      <p> 15.   An intellect that does not control the senses will fall into evil because of them: deceived by the pleasure of sense objects, it depraves itself.</p>
      <p> 16.   While controlling your senses, control your memory as well; for when its prepossessions are roused through the senses they stir up the passions.</p>
      <p> 17.  Keep your body under control, and pray constantly; in this way you will soon be free from the thoughts that arise from your prepossessions.</p>
      <p> 18.  Devote yourself ceaselessly to the words of God: application to them destroys the passions.</p>
      <p> 20.  Just as spring stimulates the growth of plants, so dispassion stimulates the intellect to attains spiritual knowledge of created beings.</p>
      <p> 21.  Keep the commandments, and you will find peace; love God, and you will attain spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 22.  You have been sentenced to eat the bread of spiritual knowledge with toil, struggle and the sweat of your face (cf Gen. 3:19).</p>
      <p> 23.  Negligence led our first forefather to transgress, and instead of enjoying paradise he was condemned to die (cf. Gen. 3:22).</p>
      <p> 24.  You, too, should keep control of Eve; and you should watch out for the serpent, lest she is deceived by it and gives you the fruit of the tree (cf. Gen. 3:1-5).</p>
      <p> 25.  As by nature the soul gives life to the body, so virtue and spiritual knowledge give life to the soul.</p>
      <p> 26.  A conceited intellect is a waterless cloud (cf. Jude, verse 12) carried along by the winds of self-esteem and pride.</p>
      <p> [V2] 327</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> 27.   In controlling your self-esteem, beware of unchastity, so that you do not shun acclaim only to fall into dishonor.</p>
      <p> 28.  Eschewing self-esteem, look to God, and beware lest you become presumptuous or unchaste.</p>
      <p> 31.  To fast well is to enjoy simple food in small amounts and to shun other people's esteem.</p>
      <p> 32.  After fasting until late in the day, do not eat your fill, lest in so doing you build up again what you have pulled down(cf Gal. 2:18).</p>
      <p> 33.  If you do not drink wine, do not glut yourself with water either; for if you do you will be providing yourself with the same fuel for unchastity.</p>
      <p> 34.  Pride deprives us of God's help, making us over-reliant on ourselves and arrogant towards other people.</p>
      <p> 35.  There are two remedies against pride; and if you do not avail yourself of them you will find yourself given a third, far more painful to bear.</p>
      <p> 36.  Prayer with tears, and having no scorn for anyone, destroy pride; but so do chastisements inflicted against our will.</p>
      <p> 37.  Chastisement through the trials imposed on us is a spiritual rod, teaching us humility when in our foolishness we think too much of ourselves.</p>
      <p> 38.  The intellect's task is to reject any thought that secretly vilifies a fellow being.</p>
      <p> 39.   Just as the gardener who does not weed his garden chokes his vegetables, so the intellect that does not purify its thoughts is wasting its efforts.</p>
      <p> 40.  A wise man is one who accepts advice, especially that of a spiritual father counseling him in accordance with the will of God.</p>
      <p> 41.  A man deadened by the passions is impervious to advice and will not accept any spiritual correction.</p>
      <p> 42.  He who does not accept advice will never go by the straight path, but will always find himself among cliffs and gorges.</p>
      <p> 43.  The truly monk-like intellect is one that has renounced the senses and cannot stand even the thought of sensual pleasure.</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> 44.  The truly physician-like intellect is one that first heals itself and then heals others of the diseases of which it has been cured.</p>
      <p> 45.  Search after virtue and do not be deprived of it, lest you live sordidly and die a wretched death.</p>
      <p> 46.  Our Lord Jesus has given light to all men, but those who do not trust in Him bring darkness upon themselves.</p>
      <p> 47.  Do not think that the loss of virtue is a minor matter, for it was through such a loss that death came into the world.</p>
      <p> 48.  Obedience to the commandments is the resurrection of the dead, for by nature life follows upon virtue.</p>
      <p> 49.  When the intellect was deadened by the breaking of the commandment, the death of the body was a necessary consequence.</p>
      <p> 50.  Just as Adam through transgressing became subject to death, so the Savior through obedience put death to death.</p>
      <p> 51.  Put evil to death so that you will not rise up dead and thus pass from a minor to a major death.</p>
      <p> 52.  Because of Adam's transgression the Savior became man, so that by nullifying the sentence passed on us He might resurrect all of us.</p>
      <p> 53.  He who has put his passions to death and overcome ignorance goes from life to life.</p>
      <p> 54.  Search the Scriptures and you will find the commandments: do what they say and you will be freed from your passions.</p>
      <p> 55.  Obedience to a commandment purifies the soul, and purification of the soul leads to its participation in light</p>
      <p> 56.  The tree of life is the knowledge of God; when, being purified, you share in that knowledge you attain immortality.</p>
      <p> 57.  The first step in the practice of the virtues is faith in Christ; its consummation, the love of Christ.</p>
      <p> 58.  Jesus is the Christ, our Lord and our God, who grants us faith in Him so that we may live.</p>
      <p> 59.  He manifested Himself to us in soul, body and divinity so that, as God, He could deliver soul and body from death.</p>
      <p> 60.  Let us acquire faith so that we may attain love; for love gives birth to the illumination of spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 61.  The acquisition of faith leads successively to fear of God, restraint from sensual pleasure, the patient endurance of suffering, hope in God, dispassion and love.</p>
      <p> 62.  Genuine love gives birth to the spiritual knowledge of the</p>

      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> created world. This is succeed by the desire of all desires: the grace of theology.</p>
      <p> 63.  When (he intellect controls the passions it is doubtless, out of fear that it does so, for it believes is God's threats</p>
      <p> and promises.</p>
      <p> 64.  When you have been given faith, self-control is demanded from you; when self-control has become habitual, it nves birth to patient endurance, a disposition that gladly accepts suffering.</p>
      <p> 65.  The sign of patient endurance is delight in suffering; and the intellect, trusting in this patient endurance, hopes to attain what is promised and to escape what is threatened.</p>
      <p> 66.  The expectation of the blessings held in store links the intellect with what it expects. When it continually meditates on these blessings, it forgets the things of this world.</p>
      <p> 67.  He who has tasted the things for which he hopes will spurn the things of this world: all his longing will be spent on what he hopes for.</p>
      <p> 68.  It is God who has promised the blessings held in store; and the self-disciplined person who has faith in God longs for what is held in store as though it were present.</p>
      <p> 69.  The sign that the intellect dwells among the blessings for which it hopes is its total oblivion to worldly things and the growth in its knowledge of what is held in store.</p>
      <p> 70.  The dispassion taught by the God of truth is a noble quality; through it He fulfils the aspirations of the devout soul.</p>
      <p> 71.  The blessings that lie in store for the inheritors of the promise are beyond eternity, before all ages, and transcend both intellect and thought.</p>
      <p> 72.  Let us regulate our lives according to the rules of true faith, so that we do not deviate into the passions and thus fail to attain what we hope for.</p>
      <p> 73.  Jesus is the Christ, one of the Holy Trinity. You are destined to be His heir.</p>
      <p> 74.  If God has taught you a spiritual knowledge of created beings, you will not doubt the words of Scripture concerning the blessings held in store.</p>
      <p> 75.  According to the degree to which the intellect is stripped of the passions, the Holy Spirit initiates the intellect into the mysteries of the age to be.</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> 76.   The more the inteUect is purified, the more the soul is granted spiritual knowledge of divine principles.</p>
      <p> 77.  He who has disciplined his body and dwells in a state of spiritual knowledge finds that through this knowledge he is purified still further.</p>
      <p> 78.   The intellect that begins to pursue divine wisdom starts with faith; it then passes through the intermediate stages until it arrives once more at faith, though this time of the highest type.</p>
      <p> 79.  Initially our search for wisdom is prompted by fear; but as we attain our goal we are led forward by love.</p>
      <p> 80.  The intellect that begins its search for divine wisdom with simple faith will eventually attain a theology that transcends the intellect and that is characterized by unremitting faith of the highest type and the contemplation of the invisible.</p>
      <p> 81.  The divine principles contemplated by the saints do not reveal God's essence, but the qualities that appertain to Him.</p>
      <p> 82.  Of the principles that appertain to God, some are to be understood affirmatively and others negatively.</p>
      <p> 83.  For example, being, divinity, goodness and whatever else we attribute to God in a positive manner, or cataphatically, are to be understood affirmatively. Unongmateness, infinity, indefinable-ness and so on are to be understood in a negative manner, or apophatically.</p>
      <p> 84.   Since the inmost divinity of the Holy Trinity is a single essence transcending intellect and thought, what has just been said, and other similar statements, refer to the qualities that appertain to the essence, and not to the essence itself</p>
      <p> 85.  Just as we speak of the single Godhead of the Holy Trinity, so we glorify the three Persons, or hypostases, of the one Godhead.</p>
      <p> 86.  The affirmative and negative qualities mentioned above are to be understood as common to the holy and coessential Trinity, and not as indicating the individual characteristics of the three Persons. Most of these individual characteristics are to be understood affirmatively, although some are to be understood negatively.</p>
      <p> 87.  The individual characteristics of the divine Persons are fatherhood, sonship, procession, and whatever else can be said of them individually.</p>
      <p> A person may be defined as an essence with individual</p>
      <p> [V2] 331</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> characteristics. Thus each person possesses both what  is common to the essence and what belongs individually to the person.</p>
      <p> 89.  Of the qualities common to the Holy Trinity, those predicated of it negatively apply more aptly than those ascribed to it positively. But this is not the case with the individual characteristics. As we noted, some of these are expressed affirmatively and others negatively; 'begottenness' and 'unbegottenness' respectively are examples of both. Thus unbegottenness' differs from 'begot-tenness' only as regards its meaning, not as regards its aptness: the first term expresses the fact that the Father was not begotten and the second that the Son was begotten.</p>
      <p> 90.  Verbs and nouns are used, as we said, to indicate the principles that in contemplation we apprehend as appertaining to the essence of the Holy Trinity, but do not refer to the essence itself. For the principles of the essence cannot be known by the intellect or expressed in words: they are known only to the Holy Trinity.</p>
      <p> 91.  Just as the single essence of the Godhead is said to exist in three Persons, so the Holy Trinity is confessed to have one essence.</p>
      <p> 92.  We regard the Father as unoriginate and as the source: as unoriginate because He is unbegotten, and as the source because He is the begetter of the Son and the sender forth of the Holy Spirit, both of whom are by essence from Him and in Him from all eternity.</p>
      <p> 93.   Paradoxically, the One moves from itself into the Three and yet remains One, while the Three return to the One and yet remain Three.</p>
      <p> 94.  Again, the Son and the Spirit are regarded as not unoriginate, and yet as from all eternity. They are not unoriginate because the Father is their origm and source: but They are eternal in that They coexist with the Father, the one begotten by Him and the other proceeding from Him from all eternity.</p>
      <p> 90. The single divinity of the Trinity is undivided and the three Persons of the one divinity are unconfused.</p>
      <p> 96. The individual characteristics of the Father are described as unoriginateness and unbegottenness: of the Son, as co-presence in the source and as bemg begotten by it; and of the Holy Spirit, as co-presence in the source and as proceeding from it. The origin of the Son and Holy Spirit is not to be regarded as temporal: how could it be? On the contrary, the term "origin' indicates the source from</p>
      <p> [V2] 332</p>
      <p> St Thalassios the Libyan</p>
      <p> On Love, Self-control and Life in Accordance with the Intellect</p>
      <p> Fourth Century</p>
      <p> which Their existence is eternally derived, as light from the sun For They originate from that source according to Their essence, although They are in no sense inferior or subsequent to it.</p>
      <p> 97.  Each Person preserves His individual characteristics im-mutably and irremovably; and the common nature of Their essence, that is to say. Their divinity, is indivisible.</p>
      <p> 98.   We confess Units- in Trinits' and Trinity in Unity, divided but without division and united but with distmctions.</p>
      <p> coetemal, co-infinite, limitless, coessential and undivided. He is the origin of created things, as the one who produces, provides for, and judges them through the Son in the Holy Spirit. "For all things are from Him and through Him, and have Him as their goal. To Him be glory throughout the ages. Amen' (Rom. 11:36).</p>
      <p> 100. Again, the Son and the Holy Spirit are said to be coetemal with the Father, but not co-unoriginate with Him. They are coetemal in that They coexist with the Father from eternity; but They are not co-unoriginate in that They are not without source: as has already been said. They are derived from Him as the light from the sun, even though They are not inferior or subsequent to Him. They are also said to be unoriginate in the sense that They do not have an origin in time. If this were not the case. They would be thought of as subject to time, whereas it is from Them that time itself derives. Thus They are unoriginate not with regard to Their source, but with regard to time. For They exist prior to, and transcend, all time and all the ages; and it is from Them that all time and all the ages are derived, together with everything that is in time and in the ages. This is because They are, as we said, coetemal with the Father; to Him, with Them, be glory and power through all the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> Inroductory Note</p>
      <p> On the Virtues and J Ices,  a concise and clear summary of standard ascetic teaching, is ascribed by St Nikodimos to St John of Damaskos (c. 675-c. 749), author of the celebrated doctrinal compendium  On the Orthodox Faith,  but it also appears among the works attributed to St Athanasios of Alexandria (c. 296-373)^ and St Ephrem the Syrian (c. 306-373)." Probably it is not by any of these three, and its date and provenance remain hard to determine. For his analysis of temptation the author is clearly indebted to St Mark the Ascetic (? early fifth century) - whom, indeed, he cites by name in another connection - and probably also to St John Klimakos (? seventh century). He adopts Evagrios' teaching on the three aspects of the soul and the eight evil thoughts, and his remarks on self-love suggest an acquaintance with the writings of St Maximos. It has been argued that the beginning and the end of the treatise, on the virtues of the soul and the body, are of Syrian origin - which would account for the ascription to Ephrem - and are possibly taken from John the Solitary (c. 500).^ St Nikodimos praises the treatise as 'a touchstone, discriminating with exactness between the tried and tested gold of the virtues and the copper alloy of the vices'.</p>

      <p> On the Virtues and the Vices   VOLUME 2:   Page 334</p>
      <p> St John of Damaskos On the Virtues and the Vices</p>
      <p> Man is a twofold being comprising soul and body, and has two orders of senses and two corresponding orders of virtues. The soul has five senses and the body five. The senses of the soul, which are also called the faculties, are intellect, reason, opinion, fantasy and sense-perception. The senses of the body are sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch. The virtues which belong to these senses are twofold and so, too, are the vices. Everyone should know how many virtues there are of the soul and how many of the body, and what kind of passions belong to the soul and what kind to the body. The virtues which we ascribe to the soul are primarily the four cardinal virtues: courage, moral judgment, self-restraint and justice. These give birth to the other virtues of the soul: faith, hope, love, prayer, humility, gentleness, long-suffering, forbearance, kindness, freedom from anger, knowledge of God, cheerfulness, simplicity, calmness, sincerity, freedom from vanity, freedom from pride, absence of envy, honesty, freedom from avarice, compassion, mercifulness, generosity, fearlessness, freedom from dejection, deep compunction, modesty, reverence, desire for the blessings held in store, longing for the kingdom of God, and aspiration for divine sonship.</p>
      <p> Besides these there are the bodily virtues or, rather, the tools or instruments of virtue. When used with understanding, in accordance with God's will, and without the least hypocrisy or desire to win men's esteem, they make it possible to advance in humility and dispassion. They are self-control, fasting, hunger, thirst, staying awake, keeping all-night vigils, constant kneeling, not washing, the wearing of a single garment, eating dry food, eating slowly, drinking nothing but water, sleeping on the ground, poverty, total shedding of possessions, austerity, disregard of personal appearance, unselfishness, solitude, preserving stillness, not going out, enduring scarcity.</p>

      <p> St John of Damaskos</p>
      <p> On the Virtues and the Vices</p>
      <p> being self-supporting, silence, working with your own hands, and every kmd of hardship and physical asceticism, with other similar practices. When the body is strong and disturbed by carnal passions, they are all indispensable and extremely beneficial When the body is weak, however, and with the help of God has overcome these passions, such practices are not as vital as holy humility and thanksgiving, which suffices for everything.</p>
      <p> Something should also be said about the vices or the passions of the soul and the body. The passions of the soul are forgetfulness, laziness and ignorance. When the soul's eye, the intellect, has been darkened by these three, the soul is dominated by all the other passions. These are impiety, false teaching or every kind of heresy, blasphemy, wrath, anger, bitterness, irritability, inhumanity, rancor, back-biting, censonousness, senseless dejection, fear, cowardice.</p>
      <p> quarrelsomeness, jealousy, envy, self-esteem, pride, hypocrisy, falsehood, unbelief, greed, love of material things, attachment to worldly concerns, hstlessness, faint-heartedness, ingratitude, grumbling, vanity, conceit, pomposity, boastfulness, love of power, love of popularity, deceit, shamelessness, insensibility, flattery, treachery, pretence, indecision, assent to sins arising from the soul's passible aspect and dwelling on them continuously, wandering thoughts, self-love, the mother of vices, avarice, the root of all evil (cf 1 Tim. 6:10) and, finally, malice and guile.</p>
      <p> The passions of the body are gluttony, greed, over-indulgence, drunkenness, eating in secret, general softness of living, unchastity, adultery, licentiousness, uncleanness, incest, pederasty, bestiality, impure desires and every passion which is foul and unnatural, theft, sacrilege, robbery, murder, every kind of physical luxury and gratification of the whims of the flesh (especially when the body is in good health), consulting oracles, casting spells, watching for omens and portents, self-adornment, ostentation, foolish display, use of cosmetics, painting the face, wasting time, day-dreaming, trickery, impassioned misuse of the pleasures of this world and a life of bodily ease, which by coarsening the intellect makes it cloddish and brute-like and never lets it raise itself towards God and the .practice of the virtues.</p>
      <p> The roots or primary causes of all these passions are love of sensual pleasure, love of praise and love of material wealth. Every evil has its origin in these. As Mark, wisest of the ascetics, says, a man cannot</p>
      <p> [V2] 336</p>
      <p> St John of Damaskos</p>
      <p> On the Virtues and the Vices</p>
      <p> commit a smgle sin unless the three powerful giants, forgetfulness, laziness and ignorance, first overpower him and enslave him. And these giants are the offspring of sensual pleasure, luxury, love of men's esteem, and distraction. The primary cause and vile mother of them all is self-love, which is a senseless love of one's body and an impassioned attachment to it. A dispersed and dissipated intellect given to frivolous talk and foul language produces many vices and sins. Laughter and loose, immodest speech also lead to sin.</p>
      <p> Moreover, impassioned love of sensual pleasure takes a great variety of forms: for when the soul slackens its vigilance and is no longer strengthened by the fear of God, when it ceases to apply itself in its love for Christ to the practice of the virtues, the pleasures which deceive it are many. For countless pleasures surge to and fro attracting the eyes of the soul: pleasures of the body, of material things, of over-indulgence, of praise, laziness, anger, of power, avarice and greed. These pleasures have a glittering and attractive appearance which, though deceptive, readily seduces those who do not have any great love for virtue and are not willing to endure hardship for its sake. Every attachment to material things produces pleasure and delight in the man subject to such attachment, thus showing how useless and harmful is the soul's desiring aspect when governed by passion. For when the man subject to this aspect of the soul is deprived of what he is wanting he is overcome by wrath, anger, resentment and rancor. And if through such senseless attachment some small habit gains the upper hand, the man to whom this happens is imperceptibly and irremediably held fast by the pleasure hidden in the attachment until he breaks free of it.</p>
      <p> As we have said already, sensual concupiscent pleasure takes a great many forms. It finds satisfaction not only in unchastity and other bodily indulgences but also in every other passion. For self-restraint does not consist only in abstaining from unchastity and sexual pleasure; it also means renouncing all the other forms of indulgence too. Hence a man addicted to material wealth, avarice or greed is also licentious and dissolute. For just as the sensual man loves the pleasures of the body, so the avaricious man lusts for the pleasures of material possessions. Indeed, the latter is the more dissolute m that the force driving him is by nature less compelling. For</p>
      <p> [V2] 337</p>
      <p> St John of Damaskos</p>
      <p> On the Virtues and the Vices</p>
      <p> in all fairness a charioteer can be called unskilled, not when he fails to control a difficult and unmanageable horse, but only if he cannot control a much less spirited animal. It is quite obvious that a desire for material things is altogether abnormal and contrary to nature, and that it derives its power not from nature but from a deliberate sinful choice; he who has yielded freely to such desire therefore sins mexcusably. So we must realize that the love of pleasure is not limited merely to the over-indulgence and pampering of the body, but includes every craving and attachment of the soul, whatever the form or object of the desire.</p>
      <p> In order to make it easier to recognize the passions in terms of the tripartite division of the soul we will classify them briefly. The soul has three aspects: the intelligent, the mcensive and the desiring aspect. The sins of the intelligent aspect are unbelief, heresy, folly, blasphemy, ingratitude and assent to sins originating in the soul's passible aspect. These vices are cured through unwavering faith in God and in true, undeviating and orthodox teachings, through the continual study of the inspired utterances of the Spirit, through pure and ceaseless prayer, and through the offering of thanks to God. The sins of the incensive aspect are heartlessness, hatred, lack of compassion, rancor, envy, murder and dwelling constantly on such things. They are cured by deep sympathy for one's fellow men, love, gentleness, brotherly affection, compassion, forbearance and kindness. The sins of the desiring aspect are gluttony, greed, drunkenness, unchastity, adultery, uncleanliness, licentiousness, love of material things, and the desire for empty glory, gold, wealth and the pleasures of the flesh. These are cured through fasting, self-control, hardship, a total shedding of possessions and their distribution to the poor, desire for the imperishable blessings held in store, longing for the kingdom of God, and aspiration for divine sonship.</p>
      <p> You should also learn to distinguish the impassioned thoughts that promote every sin. The thoughts that encompass all evil are eight in number: those of gluttony, unchastity, avarice, anger, dejection, listlessness, self-esteem and pride. It does not lie within our power to decide whether or not these eight thoughts are going to arise and disturb us. But to dwell on them or not to dwell on them, to excite the passions or not to excite them, does lie within our power. In this connection, we should distinguish between seven different terms: provocation, coupling, wrestling, passion, assent (which</p>
      <p> St John of Damaskos</p>
      <p> On the Virtues and the Vices</p>
      <p> comes very close to performance), actualization and captivity. Provocation is amply a suggestion coming from the enemy, like 'do this' or "do that', such as our Lord Himself experienced when He heard the words 'Command that these stones become bread' (Matt. 4:3). As we have already said, it is not withm our power to prevent provocations. Couplmg is the acceptance of the thought suggested by the enemy. It means dwelling on the thought and choosing deliberately to dally with it in a pleasurable manner. Passion is the state resulting from coupling with the thought provoked by the enemy: it means letting the imagination brood on the thought continually. Wrestling is the resistance offered to the impassioned thought. It may result either in our destroying the passion in the thought - that is to say, the impassioned thought - or in our assenting to it. As St Paul says, 'The flesh desires in a way that opposes the Spirit, the Spirit in a way that opposes the flesh: the one is contrary to the other' (Gal. 5:17). Captivity is the forcible and compulsive abduction of the heart already dominated by prepossession and long habit. Assent is giving approval to the passion inherent in the thought. Actualization is putting the impassioned thought into effect once it has received our assent. If we can confront the first of these things, the provocation, in a dispassionate way, or firmly rebut it at the outset, we thereby cut off at once everything that comes after.</p>
      <p> These eight passions should be destroyed as follows: gluttony by self-control: unchastity by desire for God and longing for the blessings held in store; avarice by compassion for the poor; anger by goodwill and love for all men; worldly dejection by spiritual joy; listlessness by patience, perseverance and offering thanks to God; self-esteem by doing good m secret and by praying constantly with a contrite heart; and pride by not judging or despising anyone in the manner of the boastful Pharisee (cf. Luke 18:11-12), and by considering oneself the least of all men. When the intellect has been freed in this way from the passions we have described and been raised up to God, it will henceforth live the life of blessedness, receiving the pledge of the Holy Spirit (cf. 2 Cor. 1:22). And when it departs this life, dispassionate and full of true knowledge, it will stand before the light of the Holy Trinity and with the divine angels will shine in glory through all eternity.</p>
      <p> The soul, as we have already explained, has three aspects or</p>
      <p> [V2] 339</p>
      <p> St John of Damaskos</p>
      <p> On the Virtues and the Vices</p>
      <p> powers; the intelligent, the incensive and the desiring. When the incensive power is imbued with love and deep sympathy for one's fellow men, and desire with purity and self-restraint, the intelligence is illuminated. But when dislike of one's fellow men dominates the incensive power, and desire is dissolute, the intelligence is in darkness. The intelligence is healthy, restrained and enlightened when it has the passions under control, perceives the inner</p>
      <p> essences of God's creatures spiritually, and is raised up towards the Blessed and Holy Trinity. The incensive power functions in accordance with nature when it loves all men and does not bear a grievance or harbor malice against anybody. Desire likewise conforms with nature when through humility, self-control and a total shedding of possessions, it kills the passions - that is, the pleasures of the flesh, and the appetite for material wealth and transient glory - and turns to the love that is divine and immortal. For desire is drawn towards three things: the pleasure of the flesh, vain self-glory, and the acquisition of material wealth. As a result of this senseless appetite it scorns God and His commandments, and forgets His generosity; it turns like a savage beast against its neighbor; it plunges the intelligence into darkness and prevents it from looking towards the truth. He who has acquired a spiritual understanding of this truth will share, even here on earth, m the kingdom of heaven and will live a blessed life in expectation of the blessedness that awaits those who love God. May we too be worthy of that blessedness through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p> Virtue, however, can only be attained by unremitting effort. This means that we struggle all our life to pay close practical attention to such thmgs as acts of compassion, self-control, prayer, love and the other general virtues. A person may practice these virtues to a greater or lesser degree. He may from time to time perform acts of compassion; if he does so only infrequently we cannot legitimately call him compassionate, especially if what he does is not done in a good manner and in a way that conforms with God's will. For the good is not good if it is not rightly done. It is really good, only if it is not done with the purpose of receiving some reward: as, for instance, the search for popularity or glory may be rewarded by fame, or by excessive gain, or by something else that is wrong. God is not interested in what happens to turn out to be good or in what appears to be good. He is interested in the purpose for which a thing</p>
      <p> [V2]340</p>
      <p> St John of Damaskos</p>
      <p> On the Virtues and the Vices</p>
      <p> is done. As the holy fathers say, when the intellect forgets the purpose of a religious observance, the outward practice of virtue loses its value. For whatever is done indiscriminately and without purpose is not only of no benefit - even though good in itself - but actually does harm. Conversely, what appears to be evil is really good if it is done for a godly purpose and accords with God's will. The action of a man who goes into a brothel to rescue a prostitute from destruction is a case in point.</p>
      <p> Hence it is clear that someone who occasionally shows compassion is not compassionate, and someone who occasionally practices self-control is not self-controlled. A compassionate and self-controlled man is someone who fully, persistently, and with unfailing discrimination strives all his life for total virtue; for discrimination is greater than any other virtue; and is the queen and crown of all the virtues. The same is true of the vices: we call a man a fornicator, a drunkard or a liar not on account of a single lapse, but only when he keeps on falling into the sin in question and makes no attempt to correct himself.</p>
      <p> There is something else which you must know if you really want to attain virtue and avoid sin. Just as the soul is</p>
      <p> incomparably better than the body and in many major respects altogether more excellent and precious, so the virtues of the soul are infinitely superior to the virtues of the body. This is especially true of those virtues which imitate God and bear His name. Conversely, the vices of the soul are much worse than the passions of the body, both in the actions they produce and in the punishments they incur. I do not know why, but most people overlook this fact. They treat drunkenness, unchastity, adultery, theft and all such vices with great concern, avoiding them or punishing them as something whose very appearance is loathsome to most men. But the passions of the soul are much worse and much more serious then bodily passions. For they degrade men to the level of demons and lead them, insensible as they are, to the eternal punishment reserved for all who obstinately cling to such vices. These passions of the soul are envy, rancor, malice, msensitivity, avarice - which according to the apostle is the root of all evil (cf 1 Tim. 6:10) - and all vices of a similar nature.</p>

      <p> Inroductory Note</p>
      <p> The  Discourse  that follows, unlike most of the material in the  Philokalia,  is narrative in form; doubtless it was included by the editors because of the long and important passages on inward meditation and on watchfulness. Apart from what is recorded in the present text, nothing is known about Abba Philimon. The  Discourse,  while stating that he lived in Egypt and was a priest, provides no clear indication of his date. Certainly he was earlier than the twelfth century, since the  Discourse  is mentioned by St Peter of Damaskos. Egypt seems in Philimon's day to be still part of the Roman Empire, which suggests that he lived in the sixth century, or at the latest in the early seventh just before the Arab conquest.^ The Jesus Prayer is cited by Philimon in what has come to be regarded as its standard form, 'Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon me': the  Discourse  seems to be the earliest source to cite explicitly this precise formula.</p>

      <p> A Discourse on Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> It is said that Abba Philimon, the anchorite, hved for a long time enclosed in a certain cave not far from the Lavra of the Romans. There he engaged in the life of ascetic struggle, always asking himself the question which, it is reported, the great Arsenics used to put to himself: "Philimon, why did you come here?" He used to plait ropes and make baskets, giving them to the steward of the Lavra in exchange for a small ration of bread. He ate only bread and salt, and even that not every day. In this way he took no thought for the flesh (cf Rom. 13:14) but, initiated into ineffable mysteries through the pursuit of contemplation, he was enveloped by divine light and established in a state of joyfulness. When he went to church on Saturdays and Sundays he walked alone in deep thought, allowing no one to approach him lest his concentration should be interrupted. In church he stood in a comer, keeping his face turned to the ground and shedding streams of tears. For, like the holy fathers, and especially like his great model Arsenios, he was always full of contrition and kept the thought of death continually in his mind.</p>
      <p> When a heresy arose in Alexandria and the surrounding area, Philimon left his cave and went to the Lavra near that of Nikanor. There he was welcomed by the blessed Paulinos, who gave him his own retreat and enabled him to follow a life of complete stillness. For a whole year Paulinos allowed absolutely no one to approach him, and he himself disturbed him only when he had to give him bread.</p>
      <p> On the feast of the holy resurrection of Christ, Philimon and Paulinos were talking when the subject of the eremitical state came</p>
      <p> [V2] 345</p>
      <p> Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> A Discourse on Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> up. Philimon knew that Paulinos, too, aspired to this state; and with this in mmd he implanted in him teachings taken from Scripture and the fathers that emphasized, as Moses had done, how impossible it is to conform to God without complete stillness; how stillness gives birth to ascetic effort, ascetic effort to tears, tears to awe, awe to humility, humility to foresight, foresight to love; and how love restores the soul to health and makes it dispassionate, so that</p>
      <p> one then knows that one is not far from God.</p>
      <p> He used to say to Pauhnos: 'You must purify your intellect completely through stillness and engage it ceaselessly in spiritual work. For just as the eye is attentive to sensible things and is fascinated by what it sees, so the purified intellect is attentive to intelligible realities and becomes so rapt by spiritual contemplation that it is hard to tear it away. And the more the intellect is stripped of the passions and purified through stillness, the greater the spiritual knowledge it is found worthy to receive. The intellect is perfect when it transcends knowledge of created things and is united with God: having then attained a royal dignity it no longer allows itself to be pauperized or aroused by lower desires, even if offered all the kingdoms of the world. If, therefore, you want to acquire all these virtues, be detached from every man, flee the world and sedulously follow the path of the saints. Dress shabbily, behave simply, speak unaffectedly, do not be haughty in the way you walk, live in poverty and let yourself be despised by everyone. Above all, guard the intellect and be watchful, patiently enduring indigence and hardship, and keeping intact and undisturbed the spiritual blessings that you have been granted. Pay strict attention to yourself, not allowing any sensual pleasure to infiltrate. For the soul's passions are allayed by stillness; but when they are stimulated and aroused they grow more savage and force us into greater sm; and they become hard to cure, like the body's wounds when they are scratched and chafed. Even an idle word can make the intellect forget God, the demons enforcing this with the compliance of the senses.</p>
      <p> 'Great struggle and awe are needed to guard the soul. You have to divorce your self from the whole world and sunder your soul's affection for the body. You have to become citiless, homeless, possessionless, free from avarice, from worldly concerns and society, humble, compassionate, good, gentle, still, ready to receive in your heart the stamp of divine knowledge. You cannot write</p>

      <p> on wax unless you have first expunged the letters written on it. Basil the Great teaches us these things.</p>
      <p> 'The saints were people of this kind. They were totally severed from the ways of the world, and by keeping the vision of heaven unsullied in themselves they made its light shine by observing the divine laws. And having mortified their earthly aspects (cf Col. 3:5) through self-control and through awe and love for God, they were radiant with holy words and actions. For through unceasing prayer and the study of the divine Scriptures the soul's noetic eyes are opened, and they see the King of the celestial powers, and great joy and fierce longing bum intensely in the soul; and as the flesh, too, is taken up by the Spirit, man becomes wholly spiritual. These are the things which those who in solitude practice blessed stillness and the strictest way of life, and who have separated themselves from all human solace, confess openly to the Lord in heaven alone."</p>
      <p> When the good brother heard this, his soul was wounded by divine longing; and he and Abba Philimon went to live</p>
      <p> in Sketis where the greatest of the holy fathers had pursued the path of sanctity. They settled in the Lavra of St John the Small, and asked the steward of the Lavra to see to their needs, as they wished to lead a life of stillness. And by the grace of God they lived in complete stillness, unfailingly attending church on Saturdays and Sundays but on other days of the week staying in their cells, praying and fulfilling their rule.</p>
      <p> The rule of the holy Elder was as follows. During the night he quietly chanted the entire Psalter and the Biblical canticles, and recited part of the Gospels. Then he sat down and intently repeated "Lord have mercy" for as long as he could. After that he slept, rising towards dawn to chant the First Hour. Then he again sat down, facing eastward, and alternately chanted psalms and recited by heart sections of the Epistles and Gospels. He spent the whole day in this manner, chanting and praying unceasingly, and being nourished by the contemplation of heavenly things. His intellect was often lifted up to contemplation, and he did not know if he was still on earth.</p>
      <p> His brother, seeing him devoted so unremittingly to this rule and completely transformed by divine thoughts, said to him: 'Why, father, do you exhaust yourself so much at your age, disciplining your</p>
      <p> [V2] 347</p>
      <p> Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> A Discourse on Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> Body and bringing it into subjection?' (cf. 1 Cor. 9:27). And he replied: 'Believe me, my son, God has placed such love for my rule in my soul that I lack the strength to satisfy the longing within me. Yet longing for God and hope of the blessings held in store triumph over bodily weakness.' Thus at all times, even when he was eating, he raised his intellect up to the heavens on the wings of his longing.</p>
      <p> Once a certain brother who lived with him asked him: 'What is the mystery of contemplation?' Realizing that he was intent on learning, the Elder replied: 'I tell you, my son, that when one's intellect is completely pure, God reveals to him the visions that are granted to the ministering powers and angelic hosts." The same brother also asked: 'Why, father, do you find more joy in the psalms than in any other part of divine Scripture? And why, when quietly chanting them, do you say the words as though you were speaking with someone?' And Abba Philimon replied: "My son, God has impressed the power of the psalms on my poor soul as He did on the soul of the prophet David. I cannot be separated from the sweetness of the visions about which they speak: they embrace all Scripture.' He confessed these things with great humility, after being much pressed, and then only for the benefit of the questioner.</p>
      <p> A brother named John came from the coast to Father Philimon and, clasping his feet, said to him: "What shall I do to be saved? For my intellect vacillates to and fro and strays after all the wrong things." After a pause, the father replied: "This is one of the outer passions and it stays with you because you still have not acquired a perfect longing for God. The warmth of this longing and of the knowledge of God has not yet come to you." The brother said to him: 'What shall I do, father?' Abba Philimon replied; 'Meditate inwardly for a while, deep in your heart; for this can cleanse your intellect of these things.' The brother, not understanding what was said, asked the Elder: 'What is inward meditation, father?' The Elder replied: 'Keep watch in your heart; and with watchfulness say in your mind with awe and trembling '"Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy upon me." For this is the advice which the blessed</p>
      <p> Diadochos gave to beginners.</p>
      <p> The brother departed; and with the help of God and the Elder's prayers he found stillness and for a while was filled with sweetness</p>
      <p> [V2] 348</p>
      <p> Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> A Discourse on Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> by this meditation. But then it suddenly left him and he could, not practice it or pray watchfully. So he went again to the Elder and told him what had happened. And the Elder said to him: 'You have had a brief taste of stillness and inner work, and ha\'e experienced the sweetness that comes from them. This is what you should always be doing in your heart: whether eating or drinking, in company or outside your cell, or on a journey, repeat that prayer with a watchful mind and an undeflected intellect; also chant, and meditate on prayers and psalms. Even when carrying out needful tasks, do not let your intellect be idle but keep it meditating inwardly and praying. For in this way you can grasp the depths of divine Scripture and the power hidden in it, and give unceasing work to the intellect, thus fulfilling the apostolic commando "Pray without ceasing" (1 Thess. 5:17). Pay strict attention to your heart and watch over it, so that it does not give admittance to thoughts that are evil or in any way vain and useless. Without interruption, whether asleep or awake, eating, drinking, or to company, let your heart inwardly and mentally at times be meditating on the psalms, at other times be repeating the prayer, "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon me." And when you chant, make sure that your mouth is not saying one thing while your mind is thinking about another.'</p>
      <p> Again the brother said: 'In my sleep I see many vain fantasies." And the Elder said to him: 'Don't be sluggish or neglectful. Before going to sleep, say many prayers in your heart, fight against evil thoughts and don't be deluded by the devil's demands; then God will receive you into His presence. If you possibly can, sleep only after reciting the psalms and after inward meditation. Don't be caught off your guard, letting your mind admit strange thoughts; but lie down meditating on the thought of your prayer, so that when you sleep it may be conjoined with you and when you awake it may commune with you (cf Prov. 6:22). Also, recite the holy Creed of the Orthodox faith before you fall asleep. For true belief in God is the source and guard of all blessings.'</p>
      <p> On another occasion the brother asked Abba Philimon: 'In your love, father, explain to me the work m which your intellect is engaged. Then I too may be saved." And the Elder said: 'Why are you curious about these things?" The brother got up and, clasping and kissing the saint's feet, he begged for an answer. After a long time, the Elder said: 'You cannot yet grasp it: for only a person estab-</p>

      <p> A Discourse on Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> lished in righteousness can give to each of the senses the work proper to it. And you have to be completely purged of vain worldly thoughts before you are found worthy of this gift. So if you want such things, practice the inward meditation with a pure heart. For if you pray ceaselessly and meditate on the Scriptures, your soul's noetic eyes are opened, and there is great joy in the soul and a certain keen and ineffable longmg, even the flesh being kindled by the Spirit, so that the whole man becomes spiritual. Whether it is at night or during the day that God grants you the gift of praying with a pure intellect, undistractedly, put aside your own rule, and reach towards God with all your strength, cleaving to Him. And He will illumine your heart about the spiritual work which you should undertake.' And he added: 'A certain elder once came to me and, on my asking him about the state of his intellect, he said: "For two years I entreated God in my whole heart, unremittingly asking Him to imprint in my heart continuously and undistractedly the prayer which He Himself gave to His disciples: and seeing my struggle and patient endurance, the munificent Lord granted me this request." "</p>
      <p> Abba Philimon also said this: 'Thoughts about vain things are sicknesses of an idle and sluggish soul. We must, then, as Scripture enjoins, guard our intellect diligently (cf. Prov. 4:23), chanting undistractedly and with understanding, and praying with a pure intellect. God wants us to show our zeal for Him first by our outward asceticism, and then by our love and unceasing prayer; and He provides the path of salvation. The only path leading to heaven is that of complete stillness, the avoidance of all evil, the acquisition of blessings, perfect love towards God and communion with Him in holiness and righteousness. If a man has attained these things he will soon ascend to the divine realm. Yet the person who aspires to this realm must first mortify his earthly aspects (cf. Col. 3:5). For when our soul rejoices in the contemplation of true goodness, it does not return to any of the passions energized by sensual or bodily pleasure; on the contrary, it turns away from all such pleasure and receives the manifestation of God With a pure and undefiled mind.</p>
      <p> 'It is only after we have guarded ourselves rigorously, endured bodily suffering and purified the soul, that God comes to dwell in our hearts, making it possible for us to fulfill His commandments without going astray. He Himself will then teach us how to hold</p>
      <p> [V2] 350</p>
      <p> Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> A Discourse on Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> fast to His laws;' sending forth His own energies, like rays of the sun, through the grace of the Spirit implanted in us. By way of trials and sufferings we must purify the divine image in us m accordance with which we possess intelligence and are able to receive understanding and the likeness to God; for it is by reforgmg our senses in the furnace of our trials that we free them from all defilement and assume our royal dignity. God created human nature a partaker of every divine blessing, able to contemplate spiritually the angelic choirs, the splendor of the dominions.</p>
      <p> the spiritual powers, principalities and authorities, the unapproachable light, and the refulgent glory. Should you achieve some virtue, do not regard yourself as superior to your brother, thinking that you have succeeded whereas he has been negligent; for this is the beginning of pride. Be extremely careful not to do anything simply in order to gain the esteem or goodwill of others. When you are struggling with some passion, do not flinch or become apathetic if the battle continues: but rise up and cast yourself before God, repeating with all your heart the prophet's words, "0 Lord, judge those who injure me (Ps. 35:1. LXX): for I cannot defeat them." And He, seeing your humility, will quickly send you His help. And when you are walking along the road with someone, do not indulge in idle talk, but keep your intellect employed in the spiritual work in which it was previously engaged, so that this work becomes habitual to it and makes it forget worldly pleasures, anchoring it in the harbor of dispassion.'</p>
      <p> When he had taught the brother these and many other things, Abba Philimon let him go. But after a short time the brother came back to him and began questioning him, saying: "What must I do, father? During my night rule sleep weighs me down and does not allow me to pray with inner watchfulness, or to keep vigil beyond the regular period. And when I sing psalms, I want to take up manual work." Abba Philimon said: 'When you are able to pray with inner watchfulness, do not engage in manual work. But if you are weighed down by listlessness, move about a little, so as to rid yourself of it, and take up manual work.'</p>
      <p> The brother again asked him: 'Father, are you not yourself weighed down by sleep while practicing your rule?' He replied: "Hardly ever. But if sleep does sometimes lay hold on me a little, I move about and recite from the Gospel of John, from the beginning, turning the mind's eyes towards God; and sleepiness at once</p>
      <p> [V2] 351</p>
      <p> Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> A Discourse on Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> disappears. I do the same with regard to evil thoughts: when such a thought comes, I encounter it like fire with tears, and it disappears. You cannot as yet defend yourself in this manner; but always meditate inwardly and say the daily prayers laid down by the holy fathers. By this I mean, try to recite the Third, Sixth, and Ninth Hours, Vespers and the night services. And, so far as you can, do nothing simply to gain the esteem or goodwill of others, and never bear ill will towards your brother, lest you separate yourself from God. Strive to keep your mind undistracted, always being attentive to your inner thoughts. When you are in church, and are going to partake of the divine mysteries of Christ, do not go out until you have attained complete peace. Stand in one place, and do not leave it until the dismissal. Think that you are standing in heaven, and that in the company of the holy angels you are meeting God and receiving Him in your heart. Prepare yourself with great awe and trembling, lest you mingle with the holy powers unworthily.' Arming the brother with these counsels and commending him to the Lord and to the Spirit of His grace (cf Acts 20:32), Abba Philimon let him go.</p>
      <p> The brother who lived with the Abba also related the following:</p>
      <p> "Once, as I sat near him, I asked him whether he had been tempted by the wiles of the demons while dwelling in the desert. And he replied: "Forgive me, brother; but if God should let the temptations to which I have been subjected</p>
      <p> by the devil come to you, I do not think you would be able to bear their venom. I am in my seventieth year, or older. Enduring a great number of trials while dwelling in extreme stillness in solitary places, I was much tempted and suffered greatly. But nothing is to be gained by speaking of such bitter things to people who as yet have no experience of stillness. When tempted, I always did this: I put all my hope in God, for it was to Him that I made my vows of renunciation. And He at once delivered me from all my distress. Because of this, brother, I no longer take thought for myself. I know that He takes thought for me, and so I bear more lightly the trials that come upon me. The only thing I offer from myself is unceasing prayer. I know that the more the suffering, the greater the reward for him who endures it. It is a means to reconciliation with the righteous Judge.</p>
      <p> '"Aware of this, brother, do not grow slack. Recognize that you are fighting in the thick of the battle and that many others, too, are</p>
      <p> [V2] 352</p>
      <p> Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> A Discourse on Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> fighting for us against God's enemy. How could we dare to fight against so fearful an enemy of mankind unless the strong right arm of the Divine Logos upheld us, protecting and sheltering us? How could human nature 'withstand his ploys? 'Who', says Job, 'can strip off his outer garment? And who can penetrate the fold of his breastplate? Burning torches pour from his mouth, he hurls forth blazing coals. Out of his nostrils come smoke of burning soot, with the fire of charcoal. His breath is charcoal, a flame comes from his mouth, power lodges in his neck. Destruction runs before him. His heart is hard as stone, it stands like an unyielding anvil. He makes the deep boil like a cauldron; he regards the sea as a pot of ointment, and the nether deep as a captive. He sees every high thing; and he is king of all that is in the waters' (Job 41:13, 19-22, 24, 31-32, 34. LXX). This passage describes the monstrous tyrant against whom we fight. Yet those who lawfully engage in the solitary life soon defeat him: they do not possess anything that is his; they have renounced the world and are resolute in virtue; and they have God fighting for them. Who has turned to the Lord with awe and has not been transformed in his nature? Who has illumined himself with the light of divine laws and actions, and has not made his soul radiant with divine intellections and thoughts? His soul is not idle, for God prompts his intellect to long insatiably for light. Strongly energized in this way, the soul is not allowed by the spirit to grow flabby with the passions; but like a king who, full of fire and fury against his enemies, strikes them mercilessly and never retreats, it emerges triumphant, lifting its hands to heaven through the practice of the virtues and the prayer of the intellect." "</p>
      <p> The same brother also spoke as follows about the Elder; 'In addition to his other virtues, Abba Philimon possessed this characteristic: he would never listen to idle talk. If someone inadvertently said something which was of no benefit to the soul, he did not respond at all. When I went away on some duty, he did not ask: "Why are you gomg away?"; nor, when I returned, did he ask: "Where are you coming from?" Or "What have you been doing?" Once, indeed, I had to go to Alexandria by ship; and from there I went to Constantinople on a church matter. I said goodbye to the brethren at Alexandria, but told Abba Philimon nothing about my journey. After spending quite a time in Constantinople, I returned to him in Sketis. When he saw me, he was filled with joy and, after greeting</p>
      <p> Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> A Discourse on Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> me, he said a prayer. Then he sat down and, without asking me anything at aU, continued his contemplation.</p>
      <p> 'On one occasion, wanting to test him, for days I did not give him any bread to eat. And he did not ask for any, or say anything. After this I bowed low to him and said: "Tell me, father, were you distressed that I did not bring you your food, as I usually do?" And he replied: "Forgive me, brother, even if for twenty days you did not bring me any bread, I would not ask you for it: so long as my soul can last out, so can my body." To such a degree was he absorbed in the contemplation of true goodness.'</p>
      <p> 'He also used to say: "Since I came to Sketis, I have not allowed my thought to go beyond my cell: nor have I permitted my mind to dwell on anything except the fear of God and the judgment of the age to be. for I have meditated only on the sentence which threatens sinners, on the eternal fire and the outer darkness, on the state of the souls of sinners and of the righteous, and on the blessings laid up for the righteous, each receiving 'his own payment for his own labor' (1 Cor. 3:8): one for his growing load of suffering, another for his acts of compassion and for his unfeigned love, another for his total shedding of possessions and renunciation of the whole world, another for his humility and consummate stillness, another for his extreme obedience, another for his voluntary exile. Pondering these things, I constrain all 'other thoughts: and I can no longer be with people or concern my intellect with them, lest I be cut off from more divine meditations."</p>
      <p> 'He also spoke of a certain solitary who had attained dispassion and used to receive bread from the hand of an angel: but he grew negligent and so was deprived of this honor. For when the soul slackens the intellect's concentration, darkness comes over it. Where God does not illumine, everything is confused, as in darkness: and the soul is unable to look only at God and tremble at His words. "I am a God close at hand, says the Lord, not a distant God. Can a man hide himself in secret, and I not see him? Do I not fill heaven and earth? says the Lord" (Jer. 23:23-24. LXX). He also recalled many others who had similar experiences, among them Solomon. For Solomon, he said, had received such wisdom and been so glorified by men that he was like the morning-star and illumined all with the splendor of his wisdom: yet for the sake of a little sensual pleasure he lost that glory (cf. 1 Kings 11:1-11). Negligence</p>

      <p> is to be dreaded. We must pray unceasingly lest some thought comes and separates us from God, distracting our</p>
      <p> intellect from Him. For the pure heart, being completely receptive to the Holy Spirit, mirrors God in His entirety.</p>
      <p> 'When I heard these things', said the brother, "and saw his actions, I realized that all fleshly passions were inoperative in him. His desire was always fixed on higher things, so that he was continually transformed by the divine Spirit, sighing with "cries that cannot be uttered" (Rom. 8:26), concentrating himself within himself, assessing himself, and struggling to prevent anything from clouding his mind's purity and from defiling him imperceptibly.</p>
      <p> "Seeing all this and spurred to emulate his achievements, I was continually prompted to question him. "How, like you, can I acquire a pure intellect?" I asked. And he replied: ""You have to struggle. The heart has to strive and to suffer. Things worth striving and suffering for do not come to us if we sleep or are indolent. Even earth's blessings do not come to us without effort on our part. If you want to develop spiritually you must above all renounce your own will; you must acquire a heart that is sorrowful and must rid yourself of all possessions, giving attention not to the sms of others but to your own sins, weeping over them day and night; and you must not be emotionally attached to anyone. For a soul harrowed by what it has done and pricked to the heart by the memory of past sins, is dead to the world and the world to it; that is to say, all passions of the flesh become inoperative, and man becomes inoperative in relation to them. For he who renounces the world, ranging himself with Christ and devoting himself to stillness, loves God; he guards the divine image in himself and enriches his likeness to God, receiving from Him the help of the Spirit and becoming an abode of God and not of demons; and he acts righteously in God's sight. A soul purified from the world and free from the defilements of the flesh, 'having no spot or wrinkle' (Eph. 5:27), will win the crown of righteousness and shine with the beauty of virtue.</p>
      <p> ' "But if when you set out On the path of renunciation there is no sorrow in your heart, no spiritual tears or remembrance of endless punishment, no true stillness or persistent prayer, no psalmody and meditation on the divine Scriptures; if none of these things has become habitual in you, so that whether you like it or not they are forced on you by the unremitting perseverance of the intellect; and</p>

      <p> if awe of God does not grow in your mind, then you are still attached to the world and your intellect cannot be pure when you pray. True devoutness and awe of God purify the soul from the" passions, render the intellect free, lead it to natural contemplation, and make it apt for theology. This it experiences in the form of bliss, that provides those who share in it with a foretaste of the bliss held in store and keeps the soul in a state of tranquility.</p>
      <p> ' "Let us, then, do all we can to cultivate the virtues, for in this way we may attain true devoutness, that mental purity whose fruit is natural and theological contemplation. As a great theologian puts it, it is by practicing the virtues that we ascend to contemplation. Hence, if we neglect such practice we will be destitute of all wisdom. For even if we reach the height of virtue, ascetic effort is still needed in order to curb the disorderly impulses of the body</p>
      <p> and to keep a watch on our thoughts. Only thus may Christ to some small extent dwell in us. As we develop in righteousness, so we develop in spiritual courage; and when the intellect has been perfected, it unites wholly with God and is illumined by divine light, and the most hidden mysteries are revealed to it. Then it truly learns where wisdom and power lie, and that understanding which comprehends everything, and 'length of days and life, and the light of the eyes and peace' (Bamch 3:14). While it is still fighting against the passions it cannot as yet enjoy these things. For virtues and vices blind the intellect: vices prevent it from seeing the virtues, and virtues prevent it from seeing vices. But once the battle is over and it is found worthy of spiritual gifts, then it becomes wholly luminous, powerfully energized by grace and rooted in the contemplation of spiritual realities. A person in whom this happens is not attached to the things of this world but has passed from death to life.</p>
      <p> ' "The person pursuing the spiritual life and drawing close to God must, therefore, have a chaste heart and a pure tongue so that his words, in their purity, are fit for praising God. A soul that cleaves to God continuously communes with Him.</p>
      <p> ' "Thus, brethren, let our desire be to attain the summit of the virtues, and not to remain earth-bound and attached to the passions. For the person engaged in spiritual struggle who has drawn close to God, who partakes of the holy light and is wounded by his longing</p>

      <p> Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> A Discourse on Abba Philimon</p>
      <p> for it, delights in the Lord with an inconceivable spiritual joy. It is as the psalm says: 'Delight m the Lord, and may He grant you the petitions of your heart... May He reveal your righteousness like the light, and your judgment like the noonday' (cf Ps. 37:4, 6. LXX). For what longing of the soul is as unbearably strong as that which God promotes in it when it is purged of every vice and sincerely declares: 'I am wounded by love" (Song of Songs 5:8. LXX)? The radiance of divine beauty is wholly inexpressible: words cannot describe it, nor the ear grasp it. To compare the true light to the rays of the morning star or the brightness of the moon or the light of the sun is to fail totally to do justice to its glory and is as inadequate as comparing a pitch-black moonless night to the clearest of noons. This is what St Basil, the great teacher, learnt from experience and subsequently taught us."</p>
      <p> The brother who lived with Abba Philimon related these and many other things. But equally wonderful, and a great proof of his humility, is the fact that, although Abba Philimon had long been a presbyter and both his conduct and knowledge were of a celestial order, he held back from fulfilling his priestly functions to such an extent that in his many years of spiritual struggles he hardly ever consented to approach the altar; and in spite of the strictness of his life, he never partook of the divine mysteries if he had been talking with other people, even though he had not said anything worldly and he had spoken only to help those who questioned him. When he was going to partake of the divine mysteries, he supplicated God with prayers, chanting, and confession of sins. During the service, he was full of fear when the priest intoned (he words, "Holy things to the holy.' For he used to say that the whole church was then filled with holy angels, and that the King of the celestial powers Himself was invisibly celebrating, transformed</p>
      <p> in our hearts into body and blood. It was on account of this that he said that we should dare to partake of the immaculate mysteries of Christ only when in a chaste and pure state, as it were outside the flesh and free from all hesitation and doubt; in this way we would participate in the illumination that comes from them. Many of the holy fathers saw angels watching over them, and so they maintained silence, not entering into conversation with anyone.</p>

      <p> The brother also said that when Abba Philimon had to sell his handiwork, he pretended to be a fool, in case speaking and answering questions might lead him into some lie, or oath, or chatter, or some other kind of sin. Whenever anyone bought anything he simply paid what he thought fit. The Abba, this truly wise man, made small baskets, and accepted gratefully whatever was given, saying absolutely nothing.</p>

      <p> Inroductory Note</p>
      <p> St Nikodimos, while expressing reservations about the date of the text that follows, is inclined to ascribe it to Theognostos of Alexandria (third century). This, however, cannot be the case, since the author quotes St John of Damaskos (§ 73), and so is not earlier than the second half of the eighth century; perhaps he lived in the fourteenth.^ The chief originality of the work lies in its comments on priesthood and Eucharist. Theognostos was himself a priest (§ 72), and seems to envisage a daily celebration of the Divine Liturgy (§ 14.). The long passage (§ 26) from St John of Karpathos is probably a later insertion, and not part of Theognostos' own text.</p>

      <p> and the Priesthood   VOLUME 2:   Page 359</p>
      <p> St Theognostos</p>
      <p> On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> L When you are completely detached from all earthly things and when, your conscience clear, you are at any moment ready in heart to leave this present life and to dwell with the Lord, then you may recognize that you have acquired true virtue. If you want to be known to God, do all that you can to remain unknown to men.</p>
      <p> 2.  Watch out for any unnecessary demands coming from the body and ignore them, lest they should lead you to relax your efforts before you have attained dispassion. Regard as loss, not the privation of sensual pleasure, but the failure to attain higher things as a result of having indulged in such pleasure.</p>
      <p> 3.  Consciously look on yourself as an ant or a. worm, so that you can become a man formed by God. If you fail to do the first, the second cannot happen. The lower you descend, the higher you ascend; and when, like the psalmist, you regard yourself as nothing before the Lord (cf Ps. 39:5), then miperceptibly you will grow great. And when you begin to realize that you have nothing and know nothing, then you will become rich in the Lord through practice of the virtues and spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 4.  'Break the arm of the sinful and evil man" (Ps. 10:15), by which I mean the sensual pleasure and evil from which all vice arises. Break it through self-control and the innocence bom of humility, so that when your actions are assessed and judged, no sin will be found in you, however rigorous the search. For our sms are eradicated once we come to hate what causes them and to do battle against it, repairing earlier defeat with final victory.</p>
      <p> 5.  Nothing is better than pure prayer. From it, as from a spring.</p>
      <p> [V2] 360</p>
      <p> St Theognostos</p>
      <p> On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> come the virtues: understanding and gentleness, love and self-control, and the support and encouragement that God grants in response to tears. The beauty of pure prayer is made manifest when our mind dwells in the realm of intelligible realities alone and our longing to attain what is divine is endless. Then the intellect, tracking its Master through the contemplation of created beings, and ardently thirsting to find and see Him who cannot be seen, or else contemplating the darkness that is His secret place (cf Ps. 18:11), in awe withdraws again into itself, for the moment satisfied and encouraged by the vision revealed to it for its own benefit; but it is full of hope that it will reach the object of its desire when, set free from appearances and the shadow-like fantasies seen indistinctly, as m a mirror, it</p>
      <p> is granted a pure unceasing vision 'face to face' (cf. 1 Cor. 13:12).</p>
      <p> 6.  Do not try to embark on the higher forms of contemplation before you have achieved complete dispassion, and do not pursue what lies as yet beyond your reach. If your wish is to become a theologian and a contemplative, ascend by the path of ascetic practice and through self-purification acquire what is pure. Do not pursue theology beyond the limits of your present state of development: it is wrong for us who are still drinking the milk of the virtues to attempt to soar to the heights of theology, and if we do so we will flounder like fledglings, however great the longing roused within us by the honey of spiritual knowledge. But, once purified by self-restraint and tears, we will be lifted up from the earth like Elijah or Habakkuk (cf. 2 Kgs. 2:11; Bel and Dr., verses 36-39), anticipating the moment when we will be caught up into the clouds (cf. 1 Thess. 4:17); and transported beyond the world of the senses by undistracted prayer, pure and contemplative, we may then in our search for God touch the fringe of theology.</p>
      <p> 7.  If you wish to be granted a mental vision of the divine you must first embrace a peaceful and quiet way of life, and devote your efforts to acquiring a knowledge of both yourself and God. If you do this and achieve a pure state untroubled by any passion, there, is nothing to prevent your intellect from perceiving, as it were m a light breeze (cf. 1 Kgs. 19:12 LXX), Him who is invisible to all: and He will bring you good tidings of salvation through a yet clearer knowledge of Himself.</p>
      <p> 8.  Just as lightning presages thunder, so divine forgiveness is</p>
      <p> [V2] 361</p>
      <p> St Theognostos</p>
      <p> On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> followed by the calming of the passions. This in its turn is accompanied by a foretaste of the blessedness held in store for us. There is no divine mercy or hope of dispassion for the soul that loves this world more than its Creator, and is attached to visible things and clings wholly to the pleasures and enjoyments of the flesh.</p>
      <p> 9.  Do not attempt to discover with the intellect what or where God is: since He transcends everything He is beyond being and independent of place. But contemplate - so far as this is possible -only God the Logos. Though circumscribed. He is radiant with the divine nature; though descried m a particular place. He is yet present everywhere because of the infinite nature of His Godhead. The greater your purification, the more you will be granted His illumination.</p>
      <p> 10.  If you ardently long for true knowledge and unequivocal assurance of salvation, first study how to break the soul's impassioned links with the body; then, stripped of all attachment to material things, descend to the depths of humility, and there you will find the precious pearl of your salvation hidden in the shell of divme knowledge. This will be your pledge of the radiance of God's kingdom.</p>
      <p> 11.   He who has achieved inward self-renunciation and has subjected his flesh to the spirit no longer needs to submit himself to other men. Such a person obeys God's word and law like a grateful servant. But we who are still</p>
      <p> engaged in the war between body and soul must be subject to someone else: we must have a commander and helmsman who will skillfully arm and guide us, lest we should be destroyed by our spiritual enemies or submerged beneath our passions because of our inexperience,</p>
      <p> 12.   If you are untroubled by any passion; if your heart yearns more and more for God; if you do not fear death but regard it as a dream and even long for your release - then you have attained the pledge of your salvation and, rejoicing with inexpressible joy, you cany the kingdom of heaven within you.</p>
      <p> 13.   If you have been found worthy of divine and venerable priesthood, you have committed yourself sacrificially to die to the passions and to sensual pleasure. Only then dare you approach the awesome, living sacrifice; otherwise you will be consumed by the divine fire like dry tinder. If the seraphim did not dare to touch the divine coal without tongs (cf. Isa. 6:6), how can you do so unless you have attained dispassion? You must through dispassion have a</p>
      <p> [V2]362</p>
      <p> St Theognostos On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> consecrated tongue, purified lips, and a chaste soul and body; and your very hands, as ministers of the fiery, supraessential sacrifice, must be more burnished than any gold.</p>
      <p> 14.  To grasp the full import of my words, remember that you look daily on the salvation of God which, when he saw it but once, so terrified and amazed Symeon the Elder that he prayed for his deliverance (cf. Luke 2:29). If you have not been assured by the Holy Spirit that you are equal to the angels and so an acceptable intermediary between God and man, do not presumptuously dare to celebrate the awesome and most holy mysteries, which even angels venerate and from whose purity many of the saints themselves have in reverent fear drawn back. Otherwise, like Zan, you will be destroyed because of your pretence to holiness.</p>
      <p> 15.   'Watch yourself attentively", it is said (cf. Exod. 23:21. LXX). Always offer the sacrifice first of all on behalf of your own sins: then if, because of your weakness, some defilement exists m you already or now enters into you, it will be consumed by the divine fire. In this way, as a chosen vessel, serviceable, pure and worthy of such a sacrifice, you will have power to change wooden or clay vessels into silver or gold, provided that you have intimate communion with God and He hears your prayers. For where God hears and responds there is nothing to hinder a change from one thing to another.</p>
      <p> 16.   Ponder deeply on the angelic honor of which you have been found worthy and, whatever the rank to which you have been called, strive through virtue and purity to keep yourself unsullied. For you know from what height Lucifer fell on account of his pride. Do not dream up great ideas about yourself and suffer the same fate. Regard yourself as dust and ashes (cf Gen. 18:27), or as refuse, or as some cur-like creature; and lament continuously, for it is only on account of God's inexpressible compassion and kindness that you are permitted to handle the holy things at the celebration of the dread mysteries, and so are called to communion and kinship with Him.</p>
      <p> passion-free. Otherwise he will be rejected with loathing, as if he were some foul leper who touches the body of a king.</p>
      <p> 18.  When your tears have washed you whiter than snow and your conscience is spotless in its purits', and when the angel-like white-</p>
      <p> [V2] 363</p>
      <p> St Theognostos On the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the Priesthood</p>
      <p> ness of your outer garments reveals your soul's inner beauty - then, and only then, you may in holiness touch holy things. Make sure that you do not rely only on human traditions-in celebrating the divine mysteries, but let God's grace mwardly and invisibly fill you with the knowledge of higher things.</p>
      <p> 19.  If you aspire to incorruptibility and immortality, pursue with faith and reverence whatever is life-giving and does not perish: long to depart from this world as one made perfect through faith. If you still fear death, you have not yet been intermingled with Christ through love, although, you have been found worthy to sacrifice Him with your own hands and have been filled with His flesh. For, were you linked to Him m love, you would make haste to join Him, no longer concerned about this life or the flesh.</p>
