      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> In the  Greek Philokalia  this poem appears without any introductoiy note, and nothing is known concerning its author. He lays</p>
      <p> particular emphasis upon the need for direct personal experience. Eternal life, he also insists, has to begin here and now, in this present world; but at the same time, like St Gregory of Nyssa, he sees perfection as an endless progress in the age to come, 'a step that has no limif.</p>

      <p> Theophanis the Monk The Ladder of Divine Graces</p>
      <p> Which experience has made Icnown to those inspired by God</p>
      <p> The first step is that of purest prayer.</p>
      <p> From this there comes a warmth of heart.</p>
      <p> And then a strange, a holy energy.</p>
      <p> Then tears wrung from the heart, God-given.</p>
      <p> Then peace from thoughts of every kind.</p>
      <p> From this arises purging of the intellect.</p>
      <p> And next the vision of heavenly mysteries.</p>
      <p> Unheard-of light is bom from this ineffably.</p>
      <p> And thence, beyond all telling, the heart's illumination.</p>
      <p> Last comes - a step that has no limit</p>
      <p> Though compassed in a single line -</p>
      <p> Perfection that is endless.</p>
      <p> The ladder's lowest step</p>
      <p> Prescribes pure prayer alone.</p>
      <p> But prayer has many forms:</p>
      <p> My discourse would be long</p>
      <p> Were I now to speak of them:</p>
      <p> And, friend, know that always</p>
      <p> Experience teaches one, not words.</p>
      <p> A ladder rising wondrously to heaven's vault:</p>
      <p> Ten steps that strangely vivify the soul.</p>
      <p> Ten steps that herald the soul's life.</p>
      <p> A saint inspired by God has said:</p>
      <p> Do not deceive yourself with idle hopes</p>
      <p> That in the world to come you will find life</p>
      <p> If you have not tried to find it m this present world</p>
      <p> Ten steps: a wisdom bom of God.</p>
      <p> Ten steps: fruit of all the books.</p>
      <p> Ten steps that point towards perfection.</p>
      <p> [V3] 68</p>
      <p> Theophanis the Monk The Ladder of Divine Graces</p>
      <p> Ten steps that lead one up to heaven.</p>
      <p> Ten steps through which a man knows God.</p>
      <p> The ladder may seem short indeed.</p>
      <p> But if your heart can inwardly experience it</p>
      <p> You will find a wealth the world cannot contain,</p>
      <p> A god-like fountain flowing with unheard-of life.</p>
      <p> This ten-graced ladder is the best of masters.</p>
      <p> Clearly teaching each to know its stages.</p>
      <p> If when you behold it</p>
      <p> You think you stand securely on it.</p>
      <p> Ask yourself on which step you stand.</p>
      <p> So that we, the indolent, may also profit.</p>
      <p> My friend, if you .want to learn about all this.</p>
      <p> Detach yourself from everything.</p>
      <p> From what is senseless, from what seems intelligent.</p>
      <p> Without detachment nothing can be learnt.</p>
      <p> Experience alone can teach these things, not talk.</p>
      <p> Even if these words once said</p>
      <p> By one of God's elect-strike harshly,</p>
      <p> I repeat them, to remind you:</p>
      <p> He who has no foothold on this ladder.</p>
      <p> Who does not ponder always on these thmgs.</p>
      <p> When he comes to die will know</p>
      <p> Terrible fear, terrible dread.</p>
      <p> Will be full of boundless panic.</p>
      <p> My lines end on a note of terror.</p>
      <p> Yet it is good that this is so:</p>
      <p> Those who are hard of heart - myself the first -</p>
      <p> Are led to repentance, led to a holy life.</p>
      <p> Less by the lure of blessings promised</p>
      <p> Than by fearful warnings that inspire dread.</p>
      <p> 'He who has ears to hear, let him hear.'</p>
      <p> You who have written this, hear, then, and take note:</p>
      <p> Void of all these graces.</p>
      <p> How have you dared to write such thmgs?</p>
      <p> How do you not shudder to expound them?</p>
      <p> Have you not heard what Uzzah suffered</p>
      <p> When he tried to stop God's ark from falling?</p>
      <p> [V3] 69</p>
      <p> Theophanis the Monk</p>
      <p> The Ladder of Divine Graces</p>
      <p> Do not think that I speak as one who teaches: I speak as one whose words condemn himself. Knowing the rewards awaiting those who strive. Knowing my utter fruitlessness.</p>
      <p> [V3] 70</p>
