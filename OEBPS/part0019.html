      <p> materiality, the attenuation of the flesh, the avoidance of whatever incites the mind to passion, repentance for sins committed, the dissolving with tears of the bitter sediment left by sin, the regulation of our life according to the generosity of the Spirit, and the cleansing through compunction of the inside of the cup (cf Matt. 23:26) - the intellect - from every defilement of flesh and spirit (cf. 2 Cor. 7:1), so that it can then be filled with the wine of the Logos that gladdens the heart of the purified (cf. Ps. 104:15), and can be brought to the King of the celestial powers for Him to taste. Its final goal is that we should be forged in the fire of ascetic struggle, scouring off the rust of sin, and steeled and tempered in the water of compunction, so that sword-like we may effectively cut off the passions and the demons. Reaching this point through long ascetic struggle, we quench the fire within us, muzzle the brutelike passions, become strong in the Spirit instead of weak (cf. Heb. 11:33-34), and like another Job conquer the tempter through our patient endurance.</p>
      <p> 43.  The illuminative stage pertains to those who as a result of their struggles have attained the first level of dispassion. It is characterized by the spiritual knowledge of created beings, the contemplation of their inner essences and communion in the Holy Spirit. It involves the intellect's purification by divine fire, the noetic opening of the eyes of the heart, and the birth of the Logos accompanied by sublime intellections of spiritual knowledge. Its final goal is the elucidation of the nature of created things by the Logos of Wisdom, insight into divine and human affairs, and the revelation of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven (cf. Luke 8 : 10). He who has reached this point through the inner activity of the intellect rides, like another Elijah (cf. 2 Kgs. 2:11), in a chariot of fire drawn by the quatemity of the virtues; and while still living he is raised to the noetic realm and traverses the heavens, since he has risen above the lowliness of the body.</p>
      <p> 44.   The mystical and perfective stage pertains to those who have already passed through all things and have come to 'the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ' (Eph. 4:13). It is characterized by the transcending of the sphere of demonic powers and of all sublunar things, by our attaining to the higher celestial ranks, approaching the primordial light and plumbing the depths of God through the Spirit. It involves immersing our contemplative intellect in the inner principles of providence, justice and truth, and also the interpretation of the</p>

      <p> arcane symbolism, parables and obscure passages in Holy Scripture. Its final goal is our initiation into the hidden mysteries of God and our being filled with ineffable wisdom through union with the Holy Spirit, so that each</p>
      <p> becomes a wise theologian in the great Church of God, illuminating others with the inner meaning of theology. He who has reached this point through the deepest humility and compunction has, like another Paul, been caught up into the third heaven of theology, and has heard indescribable things which he who is still dominated by the sense-world is not permitted to hear (cf. 2 Cor. 12:4); and he experiences unutterable blessings, such as no eye has seen or ear heard (cf 1 Cor. 2:9). He becomes a steward of God's mysteries (cf 1 Cor.  4:1),  for he is God's mouthpiece, and through words he communicates these mysteries to other people; and in this he finds blessed repose. For he is now perfected in the perfect God, united in the company of other theologians with the supreme angelic powers of the Cherubim and Seraphim, in whom dwells the principle of wisdom and spiritual knowledge.</p>
      <p> 45.   Human life is divided into two forms, while its goals are subsumed under three categories. One form is social and within the world, the other is solitary and transcends the world. Social life is characterized either by self-restraint or by insatiability; the solitary life is subdivided into three modes: the practice of the virtues, the spiritual cognition of created beings, and the indwelling of supernatural energy. Social life may be characterized by justice, in which case it accords with nature, or by injustice, in which case it is contrary to nature. The solitary life either aspires towards its goal in accordance with monastic precept and rule, and - perfected in a manner that transcends nature - attains the Infinite; or else it is prompted by presumption and so is balked of its purpose, debases the mind, and fails to attain perfection.</p>
      <p> 46.   The Spirit is light, life and peace. If consequently you are illumined by the Spirit your own life is imbued with peace and serenity. Because of this you are filled with the spiritual knowledge of created beings and the wisdom of the Logos; you are granted the intellect of Christ (cf. 1 Cor. 2:16); and you come to know the mysteries of God's kingdom (cf. Luke 8:10). Thus you penetrate into the depths of the Divine and daily from an untroubled and illumined heart you utter words of life for the benefit of others; for you yourself are full of benediction, since you have within you Goodness itself that utters things new and old (cf. Matt. 13:52).</p>

      <p> 47.  God is Wisdom, and by deifying through the spiritual knowledge of created beings those who live in the Logos and in Wisdom He unites them with Himself through light and makes them gods by adoption. Since God has created all things out of nothing through Wisdom, He directs and administers all that is in the world through Wisdom, and likewise in Wisdom brings about the salvation of all who turn towards Him and draw near to Him. Similarly, whoever as a result of his purity has been enabled to participate in the highest Wisdom always as an image of God acts in Wisdom, and in Wisdom carries out the divine will. Withdrawing himself from what is external and multiple, each day he raises his intelligence anagogically through the knowledge of unutterable things to a life that is truly angelic. Having unified his own life as far as possible, he unites himself with the angelic powers that move in a unified way around God, and under their good guidance is elevated to the first Principle and Cause.</p>
      <p> 48.  Once you have united yourself through the higher Wisdom with the angelic powers and have thereby been united with God, through love of Wisdom you enter into communion with all men, since you have achieved God's</p>
      <p> likeness. Through divine power you sever those so disposed from their attachment to what is external and multiple, and as an imitator of God you concentrate them in spirit, elevating them as you are elevated to a unified life through wisdom, spiritual knowledge and the illumination of divine mysteries, until they come to contemplate the glory of the unique primordial light. When you have united them with the essences and orders that surround God, you induct them - wholly irradiated by the Spirit - to the unity of God Himself</p>
      <p> 49.   Linked to the four cardinal virtues there is a group of eight natural and general virtues. Each cardinal virtue is accompanied by two virtues from the second category, thus composing a triad. Sound understanding is accompanied by spiritual knowledge and wise contemplation; justice by discrimination and sympathetic understanding; courage by patience and firm resolution; self-restraint by purity and virginity. From the throne of the intellect, in His wisdom God presides like an architect and mystagogue over these twelve virtues divided into triads, and sends out the Logos to create them within us. From their underlying principles the Logos takes the substance of each of the virtues and creates in the soul a numinous noetic world. He places sound understanding in the soul like a star-filled sky from which</p>
      <p> [V4] 154</p>

      <p> two great luminaries - divine knowledge and contemplation of spiritual essences - irradiate it with their light. He makes justice its firm foundation, rich like the earth with every kind of sustenance. He puts self-restraint within it as the air, cooling and refreshing it with a life free from all impurity. He sets courage like a sea around the weakness of our nature, enabling us to undermine the strongholds and citadels of the enemy. In thus establishing this world the Logos fills the soul with the power of the Holy Spirit, so as to maintain it in unceasing noetic activity and in indissoluble and enduring unity. As the Psalmist expresses it, 'By the Logos of the Lord are the heavens established, and all their power lies in the Spirit that comes from Him' (Ps. 33:6. LXX).</p>
      <p> 50.  Our spiritual growth corresponds to the different stages in the life of our Lord Jesus Christ. While we are infants in need of milk (cf. Heb. 5:12) we are suckled on the milk of the introductory virtues acquired through bodily discipline; yet this is of but limited profit (cf. 1 Tim. 4:8) to us once we begin to grow in virtue and gradually leave our infancy behind. When we attain adolescence and are nourished by the solid food of the contemplation of the spiritual essences of things - for our soul's organs of perception are now well attuned (cf. Heb. 5:14) - it may be said that we increase in stature and in grace (cf. Luke 2:52), and sit among the elders (cf. Luke 2:46), disclosing to them things hidden in the depths of darkness (cf. Job 12:22). When we have reached 'mature manhood, the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ' (Eph. 4:13), we proclaim to all the meaning of repentance, teach others about the kingdom of heaven (cf Matt. 4:17) and press on towards the Passion (cf. Luke 12:50). For this is the ultimate goal of everyone who has reached perfection in the practice of the virtues: after passing through all the different ages of Christ he finally undergoes the trials that Christ suffered on the cross.</p>
      <p> 51.  So long as we are learning the basic principles of bodily discipline, watching ourselves carefully when we taste food, or touch things, or gaze at beautiful objects, or listen to music, or smell fragrances, we are under</p>
      <p> guardians and trustees; for we are still infants, even though we are also heirs and lords of all that belongs to the Father. But when the time of such training is over and we have attained dispassion, the Logos is bom within us as a result of our purity of mind, and He submits to the law of the Spirit, so that He may redeem us who are under the law of the will of the flesh and may grant us the status of sonship. When this has taken place, the Spirit cries in our hearts.</p>
      <p> [V4] 155</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On Spiritual Knowledge, Love and the Perfection of Living:</p>
      <p> One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> 'Abba! Father!', making this status known to us and revealing to us our intimate communion with the Father. And He abides in us and converses with us as sons and heirs of God through Christ, free from servitude to the senses (cf. Gal. 4:1-6).</p>
      <p> 52.  For those who like Peter have advanced in faith, and like James have been restored in hope, and like John have achieved perfection in love, the Lord ascends the high mountain of theology and is transfigured (cf. Matt. 17:1). Through the disclosure and expression of His pure teaching He shines upon them as the sun, and with the intellections of His unutterable wisdom He becomes radiant with light. They see the Logos standing between Moses and Elijah - between law and prophecy - promulgating the law and teaching it to them, and at the same time revealing to them through vision and prophecy the depths and the hidden treasures of wisdom. The Holy Spirit overshadows them like a luminous cloud, and from the cloud they hear the voice of mystical theology, initiating them into the mystery of the tri-hypostatic Divinity and saying, 'This is My beloved, the Logos of perfection made manifest, in whom I take delight. Become for Me perfect sons in the perfect Spirit' (cf. Matt. 17:1-5).</p>
      <p> 53.  A soul that disdains everything unspiritual and that is wholly wounded by love for God undergoes a strange divine ecstasy. Having clearly grasped the inner nature and essence of created beings, as well as the upshot of matters human, it cannot bear to be imprisoned or circumscribed by anything. On the contrary, surpassing its own limitations, rebelling against the fetters of the senses and transcending all creatureliness, it penetrates the divine darkness of theology in unutterable silence and - to the degree that grace permits - it perceives in the intellective light of inexpressible wisdom the beauty of Him who truly is. Reverentially entering ever more deeply into intellective contemplation of that beauty, it savors, in loving awe, the fruits of immortality - the visionary intellections of the Divine. Never withdrawing from these back into itself, it is able to express perfectly their magnificence and glory. Activated, as it were, in a strange way by the Spirit, it experiences this admirable passion in unspeakable joy and silence; yet how it is activated, or what it is that impels it, and is seen by it, and secretly communicates to it unutterable mysteries, it cannot explain.</p>
      <p> 54.  If you sow tears of compunction in yourself for the sake of righteousness you will gather a harvest of life -inexpressible joy (cf. Ps.</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On Spiritual Knowledge, Love and the Perfection of Living:</p>
      <p> One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> 126:5) If you search out the Lord and patiently wait for Him until the firstlings of His righteousness grow in you, you will reap a rich crop of divine knowledge. The light of wisdom will illuminate you and you will become a lamp of eternal light illuminating all men. You will not be grudging towards yourself or your fellow beings, hiding under the cloak of envy the light of wisdom given to you (cf Matt. 5:15): but in the assembly of the faithful you will utter good words for the edification of many, explaining things hidden since the beginning of the world - all that you have heard from above, prompted by the divine Spirit, all that you have come to understand through the contemplation of the inner nature of created beings, and all that your fathers have told you (cf. Ps. 78:2-3. LXX).</p>
      <p> 55.  The practice of God's commandments will lead the spiritual contestant to such heights that on the day when he becomes perfect in virtue he will be filled with quiet delight and will reign with a pure mind in Zion. The mountains - the spiritual principles of the virtues - will flow with milk, nourishing him as he reposes in the sanctuary of dispassion, and all the stream-beds of Judah - his faith and spiritual knowledge - will flow with water, with doctrines, parables and the arcane symbols of things divine. As from the house of God a fountain of ineffable wisdom will flow from his heart and will water the valley of dry reeds - all those, that is to say, who have been withered by the aridity and heat of the passions (cf. Joel 3:18. LXX). Then he will experience in himself the true fulfillment of the Lord's words, 'Rivers of living water will flow from the heart of him who believes in Me' (John 7:38).</p>
      <p> 56.  For those who fear Me, says God, the Sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. They will go forth from the prison-house of the passions and, loosed from the bonds of sin, they will leap like calves. On the day when God restores them they will tread the wicked and the demons under their feet like ashes; for they will be exalted by all the virtues and because of their wisdom and spiritual knowledge they will be made perfect through communion in the Spirit (cf Mai. 4:2-3).</p>
      <p> 57.   If on the mountain above the plain of this world and within the Church of Christ you raise the standard of new spiritual knowledge and cry aloud, as the prophet says (cf. Isa. 13:2), with the wisdom given to you by God, exhorting and teaching your brethren - opening their mind to the divine Scriptures so that they understand the</p>
      <p> [V4] 157</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On Spiritual Knowledge, Love and the Perfection of Living:</p>
      <p> One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> wonderful gifts of God, and encouraging them to practice His commandments - do not fear those who envy you the power of your words and distort every text of divine Scripture; for they are people swept empty and ready to be</p>
      <p> occupied by the demons (cf Matt. 12:44). God will write what you say in the book of the living (cf. Rev. 3:5) and no harm will befall you from such men, just as no harm befell Peter from Simon Magus (cf. Acts 8:9-24). On the contrary, when you see such people trying to put obstacles in your way, you should say with the prophet: 'Behold, my God is my salvation and 1 will trust in Him; 1 will be saved by Him and will not be afraid; for the Lord is my glory and my praise, and He has become my salvation; and I shall not cease proclaiming His glorious deeds throughout the world'(cf Isa. 12:2,4. LXX).</p>
      <p> 58.   When you perceive that the passions are no longer active within you, and when because of your humility tears of compunction flow from your eyes, then you must know that the kingdom of God has come upon you and that you have become pregnant with the Holy Spirit. And when you perceive the Spirit moving and speaking in your heart, inciting you to proclaim in the great congregation the saving power and truth of God (cf. Ps. 40:10), do not keep your lips sealed for fear of provoking the envy of bigoted men; but as Isaiah counsels (cf. Isa. 30:8), sit and write on a tablet, what the Spirit says to you, so that it may endure in times to come and for ever. For the envious are a rebellious people, lying sons who cannot be trusted (cf. Isa. 30:9). They do not want to be told that the Gospel is still effective and makes us friends of God and prophets. On the contrary, they say to the prophets and teachers of the Church: 'Do not proclaim God's wisdom to us'; and to the visionaries who perceive the spiritual essences of things, they say, 'Do not tell us about that, but speak and proclaim to us another deceit such as the world loves, and free us from the prophecy of Israel' (cf. Isa. 30:10). Pay no attention to their malice and their words; for even the deaf will eventually hear your message, divinely inspired as it is for the profit of many, and those blinded by life's opacity and the fog of sin will see the light of your words. The poor in spirit will exult in them, and those in despair will be filled with gladness; through your words those spiritually astray will attain understanding, those who revile you will learn obedience to the utterances of the Spirit, and inarticulate tongues will be taught to speak of peace (cf. Isa. 29:18-19, 24. LXX).</p>

      <p> 59.  Blessed is he, says Isaiah, who sows the seeds of his teaching in Zion - that is, in the Church of God - and who begets spiritual children in the heavenly Jerusalem of the firstborn (cf Isa. 31:9. LXX). For according to Scripture such a man may conceal his words for a while, and may himself be hidden as if by flowing water; but in the end he will be revealed in Zion - in the Church of the faithful - as a glorious river flowing in a land thirsty for the waters of his wisdom. Then those beguiled by the envious will listen to his words, the heart of those spiritually weak will give heed, and no longer will the servants of envy enjoin silence when in his devotion he gives good counsel, instead of declaiming the inanities of the wise fools of this world. For his heart has not been occupied with empty thoughts, with ways of doing evil and telling lies in God's sight, thus misleading hungry souls and leaving the souls of the thirsty unsatisfied (cf. Isa. 32:2-6. LXX). For this reason his words will endure and many will profit from them, even though the spiteful and malicious do not believe this to be so.</p>
      <p> drunk with the cup of wisdom, and hence his counsel wiU be trustworthy. He wiU see a king arrayed in glory and he will gaze on a distant land. His soul will meditate on wisdom and he will proclaim to all men the eternal abode that embraces all and everything.</p>
      <p> 61.   The Lord's teaching is heard by all who fear Him; He gives them an ear with which to hear, and an instructed tongue so that they know when they too must speak (cf. Isa. 50:4-5. LXX). Who but He sets at naught the prudent and the wise of this world and shows their wisdom to be folly, yet confirms the words of His servants (cf Isa. 44:25-26. LXX)? He it is that in His glory does new and astonishing things: He makes a highway of humility and gentleness in the barren and arid heart, and opens rivers of ineffable wisdom in the parched and desiccated mind, giving water to the chosen people that He made His own, so that they may declare His virtues (cf. Isa. 43: 20-21. LXX). He marches at the head of those who love and fear Him, razes the mountains of the passions, shatters the brazen gates of ignorance, and opens the doors of the knowledge of God, revealing to them its obscure, secret and invisible treasures, so that they may know that He is the Lord their God, who calls them by their name, 'Israel' (cf. Isa. 45:1-3. LXX).</p>
      <p> 62.   Who is this that strikes terror into the sea of the passions and [V4] 159</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On Spiritual Knowledge, Love and the Perfection of Living:</p>

      <p> quells its waves? It is the Lord of hosts, who delivers those that love Him from the danger of sin and pacifies the turbulence of their thoughts, who puts His words into their mouth (cf. Jer. 1:9) and protects them under the shadow of His hands - the shadow within which He established the heaven and made firm the earth. He it is who gives to those who fear Him an instructed tongue (cf. Isa. 50:4) and an understanding ear, so that they may hear His voice and proclaim His commandments to the house of Jacob, to the Church of the faithful. Those who lack eyes to see the rays of the Sun of righteousness, and ears to hear of God's glory, are sunk in the darkness of total ignorance, of empty hope and vain words. Not one of them speaks justly or judges truly; for they have put their trust in vanities and their words are vacuous. They conceive envy and beget spite and malice (cf. Isa. 59:4. LXX), for their ears are obdurate and deaf. On account of this they revile the word of God's knowledge and refuse to listen to it.</p>
      <p> 63.  What wisdom is there in those filled with pangs of envy against their fellow beings? By what right do the malicious claim, in the words of Jeremiah, that 'we are wise and the law of the Lord is with us' (Jer. 8:8), when they are consumed with jealousy against those who have received the grace of the Spirit in the form of wisdom and divine knowledge? But the false knowledge of the scribes and the wise men of this world - of those who have lost the path of trae knowledge - is altogether valueless. For this reason the worldly-wise, void of the wisdom of the Paraclete, founder in confusion: they see the sons of fishermen rich in the wisdom of God and they quail at the power of their words; but at the same time they are entangled in the nets of their own concepts and reasoning, for they have rejected true wisdom and truly divine knowledge.</p>
      <p> those blessed with a tongue of fire hke the pen of a ready scribe (of. Ps. 45:1)? Have they not spumed the source of divine wisdom? Had they walked in the way of God, they would have dwelt in the peace of dispassion for ever. They would have learnt where they could find sound understanding, strength, clear judgment, spiritual knowledge of created beings, length of days, life, light for the eyes and wisdom yoked with peace. They would have learnt who finds the dwelling-place of Wisdom and who enters into her storehouses (cf Bar. 3:13-15), and how God issues a command through the prophet to those initiated into His</p>

      <p> teaching, and says, 'Let the prophet to whom things have been revealed in sleep declare his vision, and having heard My teaching let him proclaim it faithfully' (cf. Jer. 23:28); as He also says, 'Write in a book all the words I have spoken to you' (Jer. 37:2. LXX). Had they themselves chosen this path, they would not be consumed with jealousy against those who do choose it.</p>
      <p> 65.  Yet if the Ethiopian can change his skin or the leopard his spots (cf. Jer. 13:23), these same bantlings of malice can also speak and devise what seems good, well versed as they are in evil. With the heel they trip up their fellow men, their ways being ways of treachery and deception, even with regard to their friends. They lie because lying and quackery are what they are trained in (cf. Jer. 9:4-5. LXX). So if on account of your intelligence and spiritual knowledge you become a butt for their jealousy and deceit, you must be wary: appeal to God in the words of Jeremiah, saying, '0 Lord, remember me and visit me and free me from those who persecute me with their malice. Although it is Thy will to test me for a long time, in Thy forbearance do not reject me. See how those who repudiate Thy sacred knowledge have derided me. Consume them in their jealousy, and Thy teaching will be a joy to me and the delight of my heart. I have not sat in the company of those who spurn Thy knowledge, but have feared the presence of Thy hand, and sat alone because I was filled with bitterness by their envy.' When you say this you will hear the response:' "This I know well. But if you set him who has gone astray on his right path, 1 will re-establish you among My friends; you will stand before Me; and if you extract what is precious from what is vile, you will be as My mouth. I will deliver you from these malicious people who plague you", says the Lord God of Israel' (cf. Jer. 15:15-21. LXX).</p>
      <p> 66.  Let these malicious sages hear the conclusion of the whole matter (cf. Eccles. 12:13). By their labors were God's Nazintes cleansed cleaner than snow; their lives were whiter than milk, their wisdom was more lambent than the sapphire (cf. Lam. 4:7. LXX), their words purer than a pearl. Those who delight in worldly knowledge have been utterly destroyed by the departure of the Spirit. Those nourished on profane wisdom are swathed in the dung of ignorance (cf. Lam. 4:5. LXX): they are shackled in fetters, their tongue is pinioned to their larynx and they are mute. For they have rejected the true wisdom and knowledge of the Holy Spirit, not wanting to attain it through ascetic labor.</p>

      <p> 67.   God who fells the lofty tree and raises the lowly tree, who desiccates green wood and make dry wood burgeon (cf. Ezek. 17:24), is also the God who opens the mouth of His servants in the midst of a great assembly (cf. Ezek. 29:21. LXX), and enables them to proclaim the Gospel with full power (cf. Ps. 68:12. LXX). For wisdom, understanding and strength are His; and just as He changes times and seasons, so He gives to souls that seek Him and desire Him sovereignty over the passions; He converts them from one life to another, bestowing wisdom on the wise in spirit and sound understanding on those endowed with intelligence. He reveals deep hidden things to those who explore His depths and initiates them into the meaning concealed in obscure symbolism. For the light of wisdom and spiritual knowledge dwells in Him and He gives it to whom He wishes (cf. Dan. 2:21-22).</p>
      <p> 68.  If you patiently cany out the commandments in accordance with your outer and your inner self, and look only to the glory of God, you will be given the honor of heavenly knowledge, peace of soul and incorruptibility; for you carry out, and do not simply hear, the law of grace (cf. Jas. 1:25). God will not condemn your knowledge, since your actions will bear witness to it. On the contrary. He will glorify it through the words of knowledge spoken by those who by virtue of His wisdom shine as beacons in the Church of the faithful; for God is 'impartial' (Rom.  2:11).  If on the other hand your endeavors are prompted by selfish ambition and you reject the teachings of those inspired by the Holy Spirit, trusting in your own understanding and in the deceptive words of those clad merely in the outward forms of piety and incited by a vainglorious and hedonistic spirit, then you will be filled with affliction and anguish, with envy, anger and animosity (cf. Rom. 2:8-9). Such will be the immediate reward for your delusion, and such at your death - when God judges the secrets of men and renders to each according to his actions (cf Rom. 2:6) - will be the sentence for your mutually self-accusing, self-defending thoughts.</p>
      <p> 69.  'He is not a real Jew who is one outwardly,' says St Paul, 'nor is true circumcision something external and physical; he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and real circumcision is a matter of the heart, spiritual and not literal' (Rom. 2:28-29). Similarly, you are not perfect in wisdom and spiritual knowledge because you give an outward and voluble appearance of being so; and you are proficient in virtue, not</p>

      <p> because you adopt extreme forms of bodily and outward ascetic practice, but because you dedicate yourself to hidden spiritual work. You are wise and perfect in knowledge when you speak from a pure unsullied heart through the Spirit of God, not when you repeat things according to the letter. Then 'you will receive praise not from men but</p>
      <p> from God' (Rom. 2:29), since you will be unknown to men or else envied by them, and beloved and known only by God and those inspired by God's Spirit.</p>
      <p> 70.  If carrying out the law does not make you pure in the sight of God (cf. Gal. 2:16), then neither will ascetic struggle and labor alone perfect you in God's sight. We do indeed receive our grounding in virtue and check the activity of the passions through ascetic practice; but we are not initiated into the fullness of Christ through that alone. What, then, brings us to perfection? An ingrained faith in God, the 'faith that makes real the things for which we hope' (Heb. 11:1), the faith whereby Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain and was commended as righteous (cf. Heb. 11:4), and whereby Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out and sojourn in the promised land (cf. Heb. 11:8). It is such faith that fills those assiduous in the search for truth with great aspiration for the exalted gifts of God, and leads them to the spiritual knowledge of created beings; and it pours into their hearts the inexhaustible treasures of the Spirit, enabling them to bring thence new and old mysteries of God (cf. Matt. 13:52) and to reveal them to the needy. He who is blessed with such faith is initiated by love into the knowledge of God, and has entered into God's rest, having ceased from all his labors as God did from His (cf. Heb. 4:10).</p>
      <p> 71.  If God once swore to non-believers that they would never enter into His rest - and it was on account of their lack of faith that they could not do so (cf. Heb. 3:18-19) - how can mere bodily discipline, in the absence of faith, enable us to enter the rest of dispassion and the perfection of spiritual knowledge? We do in fact see many who because of this are unable to enter and to rest from their labors. We must therefore be wary lest we possess an evil, unbelieving heart (cf. Heb. 3:12), and because of this are thwarted of rest and perfection, in spite of our great: labors. Otherwise we will be ceaselessly involved in the toils of the ascetic life and will always eat the bread of sorrow (cf. Ps. 127 : 2). If a sabbath rest awaits us - the rest of dispassion and of perfect gnosis - let us through faith strive to enter into it, and not fall</p>

      <p> short of it because of our unbelief in the same way as those mentioned in the Bible (cf Heb. 4:9-11).</p>
      <p> 72.  Since we are endowed with senses, intelligence and intellection, we too ought to offer a tithe from ourselves to God (cf. Heb. 7:2). As beings endowed with senses we ought to perceive sensory things in the right way, through their beauty elevating ourselves to the Creator and referring back to Him our true knowledge of them. As intelligent beings we ought to speak correctly about divine and human matters. As noetic beings we ought unerringly to apprehend what pertains to God and eternal life, to the kingdom of heaven and the mysteries of the Spirit hidden within it. In this way how we perceive, speak and apprehend will conform to God, and will be genuinely trae and divine, constituting a sacred offering to God.</p>
      <p> 75. The tithe that we offer to God is in the tme sense the soul's Passover - its passing beyond, that is to say, every passion-embroiled state and all mindless sense-perception. In this Passover the Logos is offered up in the contemplation of the spiritual essences of created beings; He is eaten in the bread of spiritual knowledge; and His</p>
      <p> precious blood is drunk in the chalice of ineffable wisdom. Thus he who has fed upon and celebrated this Passover makes a sacred offering within himself of the Lamb who effaces the world's sin (cf John 1:29); and he will no longer die but, in the Lord's words, 'will live eternally' (John 6:58).</p>
      <p> 74.  If you have been raised above dead actions you are resurrected with Christ. And if you are resurrected with Christ through spiritual knowledge, and Christ no longer dies, then you will not be overcome by the death of ignorance. For the death which you have now died to sin, prompted by an impulse in accordance with nature, you have died once for all; but the life you now live you live in God through the freedom of the Holy Spirit, who has raised you above the dead actions of sin (cf Rom. 6:9-11). Thus you will no longer live according to the flesh, in a fallen worldly state, for you will have died to the mortal members of your body and to worldly matters. On the contrary, Christ will live in you (cf. Gal. 2:20), for you will be guided by the grace of the Holy Spirit, not enslaved to the law of your outer unregenerate self; and your members will be weapons of righteousness consecrated to God theFather(cf Rom. 6:13).</p>
      <p> 75.  He who has freed his members from servitude to the passions, and has consecrated them to the service of righteousness</p>

      <p> (cf. Rom. 6:19), has risen above the law of his fallen self and has begun to share in the sanctification of the Holy Spirit. Sin will no longer dominate him, since he is free in the freedom and the law of the Spirit. Serving righteousness has an effect altogether different from that of servitude to sin. The latter inevitably leads to the destruction of the soul's noetic power, while the former leads to the eternal life hidden in Christ Jesus our Lord (cf. Col. 3:3).</p>
      <p> 76.  So long as you live according to your fallen impulses you are dominated by your fallen mortal self. But once you die to the world, you are set free from this domination (cf. Rom. 7:2). We cannot die to the world unless we die to the mortal aspects of ourselves. We die to these when we become participants in the Holy Spirit. We know ourselves to be participants in the Holy Spirit when we offer to God fruits worthy of the Spirit: love for God with all our soul and genuine love for our fellow beings; joy of heart issuing from a clear conscience; peace of soul as a result of dispassion and humility; generosity in our thoughts, long-suffering in affliction and times of trial, kindness and restraint in our behavior, deep-rooted unwavering faith in God, gentleness springing from humble-mmdedness and compunction, and complete control of the senses. When we bear such truits for God, we escape from the domination of our mortal self; and there is no law condemning and punishing us for the death-purveying fruits we produced while still living in an unregenerate state. Once we have risen with Christ above dead actions the freedom of the Spirit releases us from the law of our fallen self (cf. Rom. 7:4-6).</p>
      <p> 77.  Those who, having passed through the 'washing of regeneration' (Tit. 3:4), possess the firstfruits of the Spirit, and who preserve them unimpaired, are deeply afflicted by the burden of their fallen self; and they long for their</p>
      <p> adoption as sons through the full gift of the Paraclete, so that their body may be freed from servitude to corruption (cf. Rom. 8:23). Indeed, the Spirit helps them in their natural weaknesses and intercedes for them 'with sighs too deep for words' (Rom. 8:26); for they have conformed their will to God and are filled with the hope of experiencing in their mortal flesh the 'revelation of the sons of God' (Rom. 8:19), the life-quickening death of Jesus (cf. 2 Cor. 4:10). In this way they too will be called sons of God, for they will be guided by the Holy Spirit, will be freed from servitude to the fallen self, and will attain 'the glorious liberty of the children of God' (Rom. 8:21), for</p>

      <p> whom, since they love God, 'all things work together for their good' (Rom. 8:28).</p>
      <p> 78.  Divine Scripture is to be interpreted spiritually and the treasures it contains are revealed only through the Holy Spirit to the spiritual. Hence the unspiritual man cannot receive the revelation of these treasures (cf 1 Cor. 2:14). The ceaseless flow of his own thoughts makes it impossible for him to understand or listen to anything said by someone else. For he lacks the Spirit of God, that searches the depths of God (cf. 1 Cor. 2:10) and knows the things of God. He possesses only the material spirit of the world, full of jealousy and envy, of strife and discord; and for this reason he thinks it foolish to enquire into the sense and meaning of the written word. Unable to understand that everything in divine Scripture concerning things divine and human is to be interpreted spiritually, he mocks those who do interpret it in this way. Calling such people not 'spiritual', or 'guided by the Spirit', but 'anagogical', he twists and distorts their words and their divine intellections as much as he can, like the notorious Demas (cf. 2 Tim. 4:10). The spiritual man does not behave in this manner; on the contrary, inspired by the Holy Spirit, he discerns all things, but he himself cannot be called to account by anyone. For he has the intellect of Christ, and that no one can teach (cf 1 Cor. 2:15-16).</p>
      <p> 79.  Since the day of judgment will be one of fire, what each of us has done, as St Paul says, will be tested by fire (cf. 1 Cor. 3:13). Thus, if what we have built up is of an incorruptible nature, it will not be destroyed by fire; and not only will it not be consumed, but it will be made radiant, totally purified of whatever small amount of filth may adhere to it. But if the work with which we have burdened ourselves consists of corruptible matter, it will be consumed and burnt up and we will be left destitute in the midst of the fire (cf 1 Cor. 3:13-15). Incorruptible and imperishable actions are the following: tears of repentance, acts of charity, compassion, prayer, humility, faith, hope, love and whatever else is done in a spirit of devotion. Even while we are still alive such actions help to build us up into a holy temple of God (cf. Eph. 2:21-22), while when we die they accompany us and remain incorruptibly with us for ever. The actions which are consumed by the fire are well known to all: self-indulgence, vainglory, avarice, hatred, envy, theft, drunkenness, abusiveness, censoriousness, and anything else of a base nature to which our appetites or mcensive</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On Spiritual Knowledge, Love and the Perfection of Living:</p>
      <p> One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> power prompts us to give bodily expression. Such actions pollute us even while we are still living and consumed by the fire of desire; and when we are wrenched away from the body, they accompany us but do not survive. On the contrary, they are destroyed and leave their perpetrator in the midst of the fire, to be punished immortally for all eternity.</p>
      <p> 80.  If through humility and prayer you have been initiated into the spiritual knowledge of God, this means that you are known by God and enriched by Him with an authentic knowledge of His supernatural mysteries. If you are tainted with conceit, you have not been so initiated, but are governed by the spirit of this material world. Thus, even if you imagine that you know something, in fact you know nothing about things divine in the way you ought to (cf 1 Cor. 8:2). If, however, you love God and regard nothing as more precious than love for God and for your fellow being, you will also know the depths of God and the mysteries of His kingdom in the way that someone inspired by the Holy Spirit must know them. And you are known by God (cf. 1 Cor. 8:3), for you are a true worker in the paradise of His Church, out of love doing God's will - that is to say, converting others, making the unworthy worthy through the understanding given you by the Holy Spirit, and keeping your actions inviolate through humility and compunction.</p>
      <p> 81.  All of us were baptized into Christ through water and the Holy Spirit, and we all eat the same spiritual food and drink the same spiritual drink; yet, though this food and drink are Christ Himself, God finds no delight in most of us (cf. 1 Cor. 10:4-5). For many of those faithful and diligent in ascetic practice and bodily discipline have mortified and emaciated their bodies; but because they lacked the compunction that comes from a contrite and virtuous state of mind, and the compassion that springs from love for their fellow beings as well as for themselves, they have remained bereft of the fullness of the Holy Spirit, remote from the spiritual knowledge of God. Their mind's womb is sterile and their intelligence without salt or illumination.</p>
      <p> 82.   What the Logos seeks from the Nazintes is not simply to ascend Mount Sinai through ascetic practice or to be purified before ascending and to wash their clothes and to abstain from intercourse with a woman (cf. Exod. 19:14-15). It is also to see, not the rearward parts of God (cf. Exod. 33:23), but God Himself in His glory rejoicing in them, bestowing on them the tables of spiritual</p>

      <p> knowledge, and sending them out to instiTict His people (cf. Exod. 32:15).</p>
      <p> 83.  The Logos does not take all His servants and disciples with Him when He reveals His hidden and greater mysteries; He takes only those to whom an ear has been given and whose eye has been opened and in whom a new tongue has been trained to speak clearly. Taking such people with Him and separating them from the others - even though the latter are likewise His disciples - He ascends Mount Tabor, the mountain of contemplation, and is transfigured before them (cf. Matt. 17:2). He does not yet initiate them into the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but shows them the glory and resplendence of the Divinity. And through the light that He gives He makes their life and intelligence shine like the sun in the midst of the Church of the faithful. He transforms their intellections into the whiteness and purity of the brightest light, and puts in them His own intellect, and sends them out to proclaim things new and old (cf. Matt. 13:52) for the edification of His Church.</p>
      <p> 84.   Many have cultivated their own fields with great diligence and have sown pure seed in them, cutting away the thorn-bushes and burning the thistles on the fire of repentance; but because God did not water these fields with the compunction-bom rain of the Holy Spirit, they did not yield anything. Parched as they were they did not bring forth the rich grain of the knowledge of God. Thus even if they did not perish through a total dearth of the divine Logos, they certainly died poor in the knowledge of God and with hands empty, having provided themselves with but scant nourishment for the divine banquet.</p>
      <p> 85.  When someone says something that edifies his fellow beings, he speaks out of the goodness stored up in his heart, since he himself is good, as the Lord confirms (cf. Luke 6:45). No one can devote himself to theology and speak about what pertains to God unless so empowered by the Holy Spirit; and no one when inspired by the Spirit of God says anything contrary to faith in Christ (cf. ICor. 12:3). But he says only what is edifying, only what leads others to God and His kingdom and restores them to their original nobility, bringing them to salvation and uniting them to God. And if 'the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each to the degree that is profitable' (1 Cor. 12:7), this means that anyone enriched with the wisdom of God and blessed with spiritual knowledge is inspired by the divine Spirit and is a storehouse of the inexhaustible treasures of God.</p>

      <p> 86.  No one baptized into Christ and believing in Him is left without a share in the grace of the Spirit, so long as he has not succumbed to any diabolic influence and defiled his faith with evil actions, or does not live slothfuUy and dissolutely. Provided he has preserved unextmguished the firstfruits of the Holy Spirit, which he received from holy baptism, or, if he has extinguished them, has rekindled them through acts of righteousness, he cannot but receive from God the fullness of this grace. He may after worthily engaging in spiritual combat be blessed through the plenitude of the Spirit with the consciousness of God's wisdom and so become a teacher in the Church; or he may through the same Spirit be given knowledge of God's mysteries and so come to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; or from the same Spirit he may acquire deep-rooted faith in God's promises, as Abraham did (cf Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:3). He may receive the gift of healing, so that he can cure diseases; or of spiritual power, so that he can expel demons and perform miracles; or of prophecy, so that he can foresee and predict things of the</p>
      <p> future; or of the ability to distinguish between spirits, so that he can discern who is speaking in the Spirit of God and who is not; or of the interpretation of various tongues, or of helping the weary, or of governing God's flocks and His people, or of love for all men and the gifts of grace that go with it, long-suffering, kindness and the rest (cf. 1 Cor. 12:8-10, 28). If you are bereft of all these qualities, there is no way in which I can call you a believer or number you among those who have 'clothed themselves in Christ' through divine baptism (cf. Gal. 3:27).</p>
      <p> 87.   If you possess love, you feel no jealousy or envy. You are not boastful, carried away by reckless pride. Nor do you put on airs with anyone. Nor do you act shamefully towards your fellow beings. You seek, not simply what is to your own advantage, but what also benefits your fellow beings. You are not quickly provoked by those who are angry with you. You are not resentful if wrong is done to you, nor do you rejoice if your friends act unjustly, though you do rejoice with them over the truth of their righteousness. You put up with disagreeable eventualities. You believe all things in simplicity and innocence, and hope to receive everything promised to us by God. You patiently endure all trials, never rendering evil for evil. And, laborer of love that you are, you never waver in your love for your fellow beings (cf. 1 Cor. 13:4-8).</p>
      <p> 88.  Of those granted the grace of the Holy Spirit in the form of various gifts, some are still immature and imperfect with regard to</p>
      <p> [V4] 169</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On Spiritual Knowledge, Love and the Perfection of Living:</p>

      <p> these gifts, while others are mature and perfect, enjoying them in their fullness. The first, by increasing their efforts to practice the divine commandments, augment the spiritual gifts they have received so that they are filled with yet greater gifts, leaving those of immaturity behind. The mature and the perfect, having attained the summit of God's love and knowledge, cease from exercising partial gifts, whether of prophecy, or of distinguishing between spirits, or of helping, or of governing, and so on (cf 1 Cor. 12:28). Once you have entered the palace of love you no longer know in part the God who is love (cf. 1 Cor. 13:9) but, conversing with Him face to face, you understand Him fully even as you yourself are fully understood by Him (cf. 1 Cor. 13:12).</p>
      <p> 89.  If in your aspiration for spiritual gifts you have pursued and laid hold of love, you cannot content yourself with praying and reading solely for your own edification. If when you pray and psalmodize you speak to God in private you edify yourself, as St Paul says. But once you have laid hold of love you feel impelled to prophesy for the edification of God's Church (cf. 1 Cor. 14:2-4), that is, to teach your fellow men how to practice the commandments of God and how they must endeavor to conform to God's will. For of what benefit can it be to others if, while charged with their guidance, you always converse with yourself and God alone through prayer and psalmody, and do not also speak to those in your charge, whether through the revelation of the Holy Spirit, or out of knowledge of the mysteries of God, or by exercising the prophetic gift of foresight, or by teaching the wisdom of God (cf 1 Cor. 14:6)? For which of your disciples will prepare for battle against the passions and the demons (cf. 1 Cor. 14:8) if he does not receive clear instructions from you either in writing or by word of mouth? Truly, if it is not in order to edify his flock that the shepherd seeks to be richly endowed with the grace of teaching and the knowledge of the Spirit, he</p>
      <p> lacks fervor in his quest for God's gifts. By merely praying and psalmodizing inwardly with your tongue - that is, by praying in the soul - you edify yourself, but your intellect is unproductive (cf. 1 Cor. 14:14), for you do not prophesy with the language of sacred teaching or edify God's Church. If Paul, who of all men was the most closely united with God through prayer, would have rather spoken from his fertile intellect five words in church for the instruction of others than ten thousand words of psalmody in private (cf. 1 Cor. 14:19), surely those who have responsibility for others</p>

      <p> have strayed from the path of love if they limit the shepherd's ministry solely to psalmody and reading.</p>
      <p> 90.  He who has given us being by miraculously uniting and sustaining the two contrary aspects of our nature, material substratum and spiritual essence, has also given us the capacity for well-being, which we can realize by means of His wisdom and spiritual knowledge. Thus through spiritual knowledge we may perceive the hidden treasures of the kingdom of heaven that He discloses to us, and through wisdom we may make known to our fellow-men the riches of His supernal goodness and the blessings of eternal life which He has prepared for the joy of those who love Him (cf. 1 Cor. 2:9).</p>
      <p> 91.  He who has risen above the threats and promises of the three laws and has entered into the life which is not subject to law has himself become the law of the Church and is not ruled by law. The life that is free is not subject to law, and therefore transcends all physical necessity and change. He who has attained such a life is as if liberated from his fallen unregenerate self, and through his participation in the Spirit he becomes incandescent. Purged of all within him that is imperfect (cf. 1 Cor. 13:9-10), he is united wholly with Christ, who transcends all nature.</p>
      <p> 92.  If you embrace the knowledge of the primordial Intellect, who is the origin and consummation of all things, infinite in Himself, and existing both within all things and outside them, then you will know how to live as a solitary either by yourself or with other solitaries. For you will suffer no loss of perfection through being on your own, and no loss of solitude through being with others. On the contrary, you will be the same everywhere and alone among all. You will initiate in others their movement towards a life of solitude and will embody the highest perfection of virtue that they set before themselves.</p>
      <p> 93.  The unconfused union and conjunction of soul and body constitutes, when maintained in harmony, a single reality, whether on the visible level or in their inner being. When not harmonious, there is civil war in which each side desires victory. But when the intelligence takes control, it at once puts an end to the jealousy and establishes concord, conforming the entire soul-body reality to its inner being and the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 94.   Of the three main aspects of our being, the first rules the others and is not ruled by them, the second both rules and is ruled, the third does not rule but is ruled. Thus when the ruling aspect falls under the</p>
      <p> Nikitas Stithatos</p>
      <p> On Spiritual Knowledge, Love and the Perfection of Living:</p>
      <p> One Hundred Texts</p>
      <p> domination of either of those aspects which are ruled, that which is by nature free becomes the servant of what are by nature servants; it loses its rightful pre-eminence and nature, and this provokes great discord among the three leading powers of the soul. So long as there is this discord among them, all things are not yet made subject to the divine Logos (cf. Heb. 2:8). But when the ruling aspect governs the others and brings them under its own direction and control, then the discordant elements, united into one and becoming concordant, are led peacefully to God. And when all is subjected to the Logos, He delivers the kingdom to God the Father (cf 1 Cor. 15: 24).</p>
      <p> 95.  When the five senses are subject to the four principal virtues and maintain their obedience, they enable the body, composed of the four elements, tranquilly to fulfill the round of life. When the body is thus disposed, the soul's powers are not in a state of discord; the passible aspect of the appetitive and mcensive powers is united with the power of the intelligence, and the intellect assumes its natural sovereignty. It makes the four principal virtues its chariot and the five subservient senses its seat. And once it has subdued the imperious and unregenerate self, the intellect is seized and borne heavenward in its four-horsed chariot and, led before the King of the ages, is crowned with the crow n of victory and rests from its long endeavor.</p>
      <p> 96.  For those who with the support of the Spirit have entered the fullness of contemplation, a chalice of wine is made ready, and bread from a royal banquet is set before them. A throne is prepared for their repose and silver for their wealth. Close at hand is a treasure-house of pearls and precious stones, and untold riches are bestowed upon them. Because of the promptness with which they act, their ascetic life renders them visionary and prepares them to be brought into the presence, not of sluggards, but of the King.</p>
      <p> 97.   Is the kingdom of heaven already given in this life to all those advanced on the spiritual way, or is it given to them after the dissolution of the body? If in this life, our victory is unassailable, our joy inexpressible, and our path to paradise unimpeded: we are directly present in the divine East (cf. Gen. 2:8). But if it is given only after death and dissolution, we should ask that our departure from this life may take place without fear; we should learn what the kingdom of heaven is, what the kingdom of God is, and what paradise is, and how the one differs from the other; also what the nature of time is in each of them, and whether we enter all three, and how and when and after</p>

      <p> how much time. If you enter the first while you are still alive and in the flesh you will not fail to enter the other two.</p>
      <p> 98.  The world above is as yet incomplete, and awaits its fulfillment from the first-bom of Israel - from those who see God; for it receives its completion from those who attain the knowledge of God. Once it is complete, and has brought to an end the lower world of believers and unbelievers, it constitutes a single congregation, allocating to each member his appointed place, and separating out what cannot be reconciled. It draws to itself the origins and ends of all other worlds and, itself unlimited, it sets bounds to them. It is not affected or limited by any other principle, as something that is under constraint. For it is ever-active, in such a way that it is never self-confined or extended beyond its own limits. It is the sabbath rest of other worlds and of every other principle and activity.</p>
      <p> 99.   The nine heavenly powers sing hymns of praise that have a threefold structure, as they stand in threefold rank before the Trinity, in awe celebrating their liturgy and glorifying God. Those who come first - immediately below Him who is the Source and Cause of all things and from whom they take their origin - are the initiators of the hymns and are named thrones. Cherubim and Seraphim. They are characterized by a fiery wisdom and a knowledge of heavenly things, and their supreme accomplishment is the godly hymn of El, as the Divinity is called in Hebrew. Those in the middle rank, encircling God between the first triad and the last, are the authorities, dominions and powers. They are characterized by their ordering of great events, their performance of wondrous deeds and working of miracles, and their supreme accomplishment is the Trisagion: Holy, Holy, Holy (cf Isa. 6:3; Rev. 4:8). Those nearest to us, superior to us but below the more exalted ranks, are the principalities, archangels and angels. They are characterized by their ministrative function, and their supreme accomplishment is the sacred hymn Alleluia (cf. Rev. 19:1). When our intelligence is perfected through the practice of the virtues and is elevated through the knowledge and wisdom of the Spirit and by the divine fire, it is assimilated to these heavenly powers through the gifts of God, as by virtue of its purity it draws towards itself the particular characteristic of each of them. We are assimilated to the third rank through the ministration and performance of God's commandments.</p>

      <p> We are assimilated to the second rank through our compassion and solidarity with our fellow-men, as well as through our ordering of matters great and divine, and through the activities of the Spirit. We are assimilated to the first rank through the fiery wisdom of the Logos and through knowledge of divine and human affairs. Perfected in this way, and rewarded with the gifts that belong by nature to the heavenly powers, our intelligence is united through them with the God of the Decad, for it offers to Him from its own being the finest of all the offerings that can be made by the tenth rank.</p>

      <p> He contains within Himself the origins and ends of all things. He is outside everything, since He transcends all things. To be within Him you must embrace the inner essences and possess a spiritual knowledge of created beings. Then while standing outside all things you will dwell within all things and know their origins and ends; for you will have attained a spiritual union with the Father through the Logos and will have been perfected in the Spirit. May the sovereignty of this all-perfect, indivisible and coessential Trinity, worshipped in Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and glorified in one nature, kingdom and power of Divinity, prevail throughout the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> In the past the full significance of Theoliptos in the development of fourfeenth-century Orthodox theology has been underestimated, largely because most of his writings remain still unpublished.^ The texts included in  The Philokalia  represent no more than a small part of his total output. Bom at Nicaea around 1250, Theoliptos was at first married, but at an early age he separated from his wife and became a monk. He suffered imprisonment because of his firm opposition to the union between the Orfhodox Church and the Church Of Rome, promulgated at the Council of Lyons (1274) and upheld by the Emperor Michael Vlll Palaiologos. Following Michael's death, Theoliptos was elevated to the see of Philadelphia in 1284, and held the position of metropolitan there for nearly forfy years. He led the heroic defence of the city against Turkish attack in 1310, and died in 1322. He was widely respected as a spiritual father, and his work in this sphere is known to us above all through his letters of direction to the nun Irene-Evlogia Choumnaina, abbess of the double monastery of Christ Philanthropos Sotir in Constantinople. St Gregory Palamas, who in his early years was a disciple of Theoliptos, in the  Triads  singles him out for mention as one of the leading teachers of hesychasm who lived 'in our</p>

      <p> The main text included here.  On Inner Work in Christ and the Monastic Profession,  was addressed by Theoliptos to Irene-Evlogia, but in the manuscript used by St Makarios and St Nikodimos all the expressions originally in the feminine have been changed to the masculine. In our translation we have taken account of alternative readings supplied by Fr Severien Salaville."  On Inner Work in Christ is  a brief but comprehensive survey of the monastic vocation, offering practical advice on the outward ordering of daily life - on behaviour in church and the refectory, on conversations within the community and with outside persons, on psalmody, spiritual reading, work and sleep -but dealing above all with inner prayer. Theoliptos draws a close parallel between monastic life and the sacrament of baptism.^ He is apophatic in his approach, emphasizing the need to lay aside 'all representational images', thereby attaining 'an ignorance surpassing all knowledge'.'' He refers several times to the invocation of the name of Jesus, and briefly mentions illumination by the divine light.^^ Here, drawing on earlier tradition, he anticipates the themes taken up by Palamas later in the fourteenth century.</p>

      <p> Theoliptos, Metropolitan of Philadelphia</p>
      <p> On Inner Work in Christ And the Monastic Profession</p>
      <p> The monastic profession is a lofty and fruitful tree whose root is detachment from all corporeal things, whose branches are freedom from passionate craving and total alienation from what you have renounced, and whose fruit is the acquisition of virtue, a deifying love, and the uninterrupted joy mat results from these two things; for, as St Paul says, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace and the other things he mentions (cf Gal. 5:22).</p>
      <p> Flight from the world is rewarded by refuge in Christ. By 'world I mean here attachment to sensory things and to worldly proclivities. If you detach yourself from such things through knowledge of the truth you are assimilated to Christ, acquiring a love for Him that allows you to put aside all worldly matters and to purchase the precious pearl, that is to say, Christ Himself (cf Matt 13:46).</p>
      <p> You put on Christ through the baptism of salvation (cf. Gal. 3:27), being thus washed clean, illumined with spiritual grace and restored to your original nobility. But what happened then as a result of your weakness of will? Through over-attachment to the world you subverted your likeness to God, through coddling the flesh you rendered the divine image within you powerless, and with passion-embroiled thoughts you beclouded your soul's mirror so</p>
      <p> that Christ, the spiritual Sun, can no longer manifest Himself in it.</p>
      <p> Now, however, you have transfixed your soul with the fear of God. You have recognized the world's benighted abnormity and the mental dissipation and vain distraction which it generates, and you have been wounded by a longing for stillness. Obedient to the precepts 'Seek peace and pursue it' (Ps. 34:14) and "Return to your rest, O my soul' (Ps. 116:7), you have sought to bring peace to your thoughts. You have therefore resolved to regain the nobility that you received</p>
      <p> [V4] 178</p>
      <p> Theoliptos, Metropolitan of Philadelphia</p>
      <p> On Inner Work in Christ And the Monastic Profession</p>
      <p> through grace at baptism, but jettisoned by your own free choice through your self-indulgence in the world; and accordingly you have entered this sacred school and set to work, donning the venerable habit of repentance and vowing courageously to remain in the monastery until death.</p>
      <p> This is now the second covenant you have made with God. The first you made when you originally entered into this life; the second, as you swiftly approach its dose. Then through the profession of the trae faith you were numbered among Christ's flock; now you are united to Him through repentance. Then you found grace; now you have contracted an obligation. Then, still a little child, you were not aware of the honor conferred on you, although later, as you grew up, you began to appreciate the greatness of the gift and restrained your tongue accordingly. Now, having reached complete understanding, you fully recognize the significance of the vow you are taking. Beware lest you fail to fulfill this promise as well, and are cast, like some shattered pot, into the outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth (cf. Matt. 8:12). No path other than that of repentance leads to salvation.</p>
      <p> Listen to what David promises you: 'You have made the Most High your refuge' (Ps. 91:9) and, if on the model of Christ you choose a life of tribulation, 'no plague will come near you' (Ps. 91:10) - no evil, that is to say, will be inflicted on you because of your worldly life. Now that you have chosen to repent, you will not be shadowed by avidity, self-indulgence, self-glorification, self-display or sensual dissipation. Distraction of the mind, captivity of the intellect, the levity of successive thoughts, and every other kind of deliberate prevarication and confusion - from all such aberrations you will be set free. Nor will you be constrained by the love of parents, brothers and sisters, relatives, friends and acquaintances, and you will not waste time in pointless meetings and talks with them</p>
      <p> If you thus give yourself soul and body to the religious life, no scourge of anguish will afflict you (cf. Ps. 91:10), nor will distress pierce your heart or darken your countenance. Distress is muted in those who have renounced the life of pleasure and are free from attachment to the things that 1 have mentioned, for Christ reveals Himself to the striving soul and bestows ineffable joy on the heart. No worldly delight or suffering can take away this spiritual joy, for holy meditation, the mindfulness of God that brings salvation, divine</p>

      <p> And the Monastic Profession</p>
      <p> thoughts and words of wisdom nourish and protect everyone engaged m spiritual warfare. That is why such a person treads upon aU mindless desire and headstrong anger as upon an asp or basilisk, quelling pleasure as though it were a snake and wrath as though it were a lion (cf Ps. 91:13. LXX). This is because he has transferred all his hope from men and from worldly things to God, has been enriched with divine knowledge and always calls spiritually upon God to come to his aid. As the Psalmist writes, 'Because he has set his hope on Me, I will deliver him; I will protect him, because he has known My name. He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him: not only will I deliver him from those who afflict him, but I will also glorify him' (cf. Ps. 91:15-16).</p>
      <p> Do you see the struggles of those who lead a godly ascetic life, and the rewards granted them? Then put your calling into action without more ado. Just as you have secluded yourself bodily, rejecting worldly things, so likewise seclude yourself in soul by subjecting also the thoughts of all such things. You have changed your outward clothing; make your monastic profession into a reality. You have separated yourself from crowds of strangers; distance yourself also from the few who are related to you by birth. If you do not put an end to delusions prompted by external things, you will not overcome those that ambush you from within. If you do not triumph over those who fight against you with visible means, you will not repulse your invisible enemies. But when you have quelled both external and inner distraction, your intellect will rise to spiritual labor and spiritual discourse. In the place of conventional dealings with relatives and friends you will follow the ways of virtue; and instead of filling your soul with vain words bom of worldly contacts, you will illumine and fill it with understanding through meditating upon the meaning of Holy Scripture.</p>
      <p> To give free rein to the senses is to shackle the soul, to shackle the senses is to liberate it. When the sun sets, night comes; when Christ leaves the soul, the darkness of the passions envelops it and incorporeal predators tear it asunder. When the visible sun rises, animals retreat into their lairs; when Christ rises in the heaven of the praying mind, worldly preoccupations and proclivities abscond, and the intellect goes forth to its labor - that is, to meditate on the divine - until the evening (cf. Ps. 104:19-23). Not that the intellect limits its fulfillment of the spiritual law to any period of time or performs it according to some measure; on the contrary, it continues to fulfill it</p>
      <p> [V4] 180</p>
      <p> Theoliptos, Metropolitan of Philadelphia</p>
      <p> On Inner Work in Christ And the Monastic Profession</p>
      <p> until it reaches the term of this present life and the soul departs from the body. That is what is meant in the Psalms when it is said, 'How 1 have loved Thy law, 0 Lord; it is my meditation all the day long' (Ps. 119:97) - where 'day' means the whole course of one's present life.</p>
      <p> Suspend, then, your gossip with the outer world and fight against the thoughts within until you find the abode of pure prayer and Christ's dwelling-place. Thus you will be illumined and mellowed by His knowledge and His presence, enabled to experience tribulation for His sake as joy and to shun worldly pleasure as you would bitter poison.</p>
      <p> Winds rouse the Sea's waves, and until they drop the waves will not subside and the sea will not grow calm.</p>
      <p> Similarly, if you are not careful evil spirits will rouse in your soul memories of parents, brothers and sisters, relatives, acquaintances, banquets, celebrations, theatres and various other images of pleasure; and they will incite you to seek for happiness in visual, vocal and corporeal things, so that you waste not only the present moment but also the time that you sit alone in your cell, in bringing to mind what you have seen and spoken about. Preoccupied in this way with memories of his worldly activities, the monk's life passes profitlessly: he is like a man who retreads his own footsteps in the snow.</p>
      <p> If we continue to nourish the demons, when will we slay them? If we let our mind dwell on actions and thoughts related to meaningless friendships and habits, when will we mortify the will of the flesh? When will we live the Christ-like life to which we have committed ourselves? The foot's imprint in the snow dissolves when the sun shines or when it begins to rain. Mind-embedded memories of self-indulgence whether in thought or act are effaced when as the result of prayer and tears of compunction Christ rises in the heart. But when will the monk who does not practice what he has professed expunge passion-imbued memories from his mind?</p>
      <p> Moral virtues pertaining to the body are effectuated when you give up commerce with the world. Holy images and thoughts are imprinted on the soul when you efface memories of previous actions by frequent prayer and fervent compunction. Heartfelt contrition and the illumination that comes from constant mmdfulness of God excise evil memories like a razor.</p>
      <p> Copy the wisdom of the bees; when they become aware of an encircling swarm of wasps, they remain inside their hive and so escape</p>
      <p> [V4] 181</p>
      <p> Theoliptos, Metropolitan of Philadelphia</p>
      <p> On Inner Work in Christ And the Monastic Profession</p>
      <p> the attacks with which they are threatened. Wasps signify commerce with the world: avoid such commerce at all costs, stay in your cell, and there try to re-enter the innermost citadel of the soul, the dwelling-place of Christ, where you will truly find the peace, joy and serenity of Christ the spiritual Sun - gifts that He irradiates and with which He rewards the soul that receives Him with faith and devotion.</p>
      <p> Sitting in your cell, then, be mindful of God, raising your intellect above all things and prostrating it wordlessly before Him, exposing your heart's state to Him, and cleaving to Him in love. For mindfulness of God is the contemplation of God, who draws to Himself the mtellect's vision and aspiration, and illumines the intellect with His own light. When the intellect turns toward God and stills all representational images of created things, it perceives in an imageless way, and through an ignorance surpassing all knowledge its vision is illumined by God's unapproachable glory. Although not knowing, because what it perceives is beyond all knowledge, nevertheless the intellect does know through the truth of Him who truly is and who alone transcends all being. Nourishing its love on the wealth of goodness that pours forth from God, and fulfilling thereby its own nature, it is granted blessed and eternal repose.</p>
      <p> Such are the characteristics of true mindfulness of God. Prayer is the mind's dialogue with God, in which words of petition are uttered with the intellect riveted wholly on God. For when the mind unceasingly repeats the name of the Lord and the intellect gives its full attention to the invocation of the divine name, the light of the knowledge of God</p>
      <p> overshadows the entire soul hke a luminous cloud.</p>
      <p> Concentrated mindfulness of God is followed by love and joy: 'I remembered God, and I rejoiced', writes the Psalmist (Ps. 77:3. LXX). Pure prayer is followed by divine knowledge and compunction; again the Psalmist writes, 'On whatever day I call upon Thee, behold, I shall know that Thou art my God' (Ps. 56:9. LXX); and. The offering acceptable to God is a contrite spirit' (Ps. 51:17). When intellect and mind stand attentive before God in fervent supplication, compunction of the soul will ensue. When intellect, intelligence and spirit prostrate themselves before God, the first through attentiveness, the second through invocation, and the third through Compunction and love, the whole of your inner self serves God; for 'You shall love your God with all your heart' (Deut. 6:5; Matt. 22:37).</p>
      <p> You should take particular notice of this lest, though you thmk you [V4] 182</p>
      <p> Theoliptos, Metropolitan of Philadelphia</p>
      <p> On Inner Work in Christ And the Monastic Profession</p>
      <p> are praying, you wander far from prayer, and accomplish nothing. This is what happens during the chanting of psalms when the tongue utters the words of the verses while the intellect is carried away elsewhere and is dispersed among passion-charged thoughts and other things, with the result that comprehension of the psalms goes by the board. The same thing also happens where we mind is concerned. Time and again, when the mind repeats the words of the prayer the intellect does not keep it company and does not fix its attention on God, to whom our words of prayer are being addressed; imperceptibly it is turned aside by one thought or another. The mind says the words as usual, but the intellect lapses from the knowledge of God. As a result, the soul is devoid of understanding and devotion, since the intellect is fragmented by fantasies, distracted by what has enticed it away or by what it has deliberately chosen.</p>
      <p> When there is no conscious understanding of prayer and when the suppliant does not put himself in the presence of Him whom he invokes, how can the soul be gladdened? How can a heart find joy when it only pretends to pray but lacks true prayer? "The hearts of those who seek the Lord will rejoice' (cf Ps. 105:3). To seek the Lord is to prostrate yourself with your whole mind and with great fervor before God and to expel every worldly thought with the knowledge and love of God that spring from pure and unremitting prayer.</p>
      <p> In order to clarify the nature of the vision bom in the intellect as a result of the mindfulness of God and the status of the mind during pure prayer, I shall use the analogy of the bodily eye and tongue. What the pupil is to the eye and utterance is to the tongue, mindfulness is to the intellect and prayer is to the mind. Just as the eye, when it receives the visual impression of an object, makes no sound, but acquires knowledge of what is seen through the experience of sight, so it is with the intellect: when through its mindfulness of God it is lovingly assimilated to Him, cleaving to Him exponentially and in the silence of direct and unalloyed intellection, it is illumined by divine light and receives a pledge of the radiance in store for it. Or again, as the tongue when it speaks reveals to the hearer the hidden disposition of the intellect, so the mind, when it repeats frequently and ardently the brief words of the prayer, reveals the soul's petition to the all-knowing God. Persistence in prayer and unceasing contrition of heart enkindle God's compassion for man and call down the riches of salvation; for 'God will not despise a broken and a contrite heart'(Ps. 51:17).</p>
      <p> Theoliptos, Metropolitan of Philadelphia</p>
      <p> On Inner Work in Christ And the Monastic Profession</p>
      <p> Another illustration which may lead you to an understanding of pure prayer is that of the earthly king. When you approach a king, you stand before him bodily, entreat him orally, and fix your eyes upon him, thus drawing to yourself his royal favor. Act in the same manner, whether in church or in the solitude of your cell. When in God's name you gather together with the brethren, present yourself bodily to God and offer Him psalms chanted orally; and likewise keep your intellect attentive to the words and to God Himself, aware of who it is that your intellect addresses and entreats. For when the mind devotes itself to prayer actively and with purity, the heart is granted inexpressible peace and a joy which cannot be taken away. Again, when you sit alone in your cell, cleave to this mental prayer with watchful intellect and contrite spirit. Then on account of your watchfulness the grace of contemplation will descend upon you, knowledge will dwell in you by virtue of your prayer, and wisdom will repose in you because of your compunction, banishing mindless pleasure and replacing it with divine love.</p>
      <p> Believe me, 1 tell the tmth. If in all your activity you cleave inseparably to the mother of blessings, prayer, then prayer itself will not rest until it has shown you the bridal chamber and has led you within, filling you with ineffable glory and joy. By removing every impediment, prayer smoothes the path of virtue and renders it easy for those who pursue it.</p>
      <p> Consider now the effects of mental prayer. Dialogue with God destroys passion-imbued thoughts, while the intellect's concentration on God dispels worldly preoccupations. Compunction of soul repels affection for the flesh, and the prayer bom from ceaseless invocation of the divine name reveals itself as the concordance and union of intellect, intelligence and soul; for 'where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am in the midst of them' (Matt. 18:20). Thus by recollecting the powers of the soul dispersed by the passions, and by uniting them to one another and to itself, prayer assimilates the tripartite soul to the one God in three hypostases.</p>
      <p> By first removing the ugliness of sin from the soul through the practice of virtue, and then through sacred knowledge renewing the divine beauty imprinted upon it, prayer presents the soul to God. At once the soul recognizes its Creator, for 'on whatever day 1 call upon Thee, behold, 1 shall know that Thou art my God' (Ps. 56:9. LXX); and in turn it is known by God, for "the Lord knows those that are His'</p>
      <p> [V4] 184</p>
      <p> Theoliptos, Metropolitan of Philadelphia</p>
      <p> On Inner Work in Christ And the Monastic Profession</p>
      <p> (2 Tim. 2:19). It knows God because of the purity of His image within it, for every image leads one back to its original; and it is known by God because its likeness to God has been restored through the practice of the virtues. Thus it is by means of the virtues that the soul knows God and is known by God.</p>
      <p> The person who courts the favor of a king does so in one of three ways. He either entreats his possible benefactor with words, or stands silently before him, or throws himself at his feet Pure prayer, uniting to itself intellect, intelligence and spirit, invokes the divine name with the intelligence; with the intellect it concentrates its unwavering attention on God whom it invokes; and with the spirit it manifests compunction, humility, and love. In this way it entreats the unonginate Trinity - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - the one God.</p>
      <p> Just as variety in food stimulates the appetite, so the varied forms of virtue awaken the activity of the intellect. Thus while you travel the path of the mind, repeat again and again the words of the prayer, hold converse with the Lord, cry out ceaselessly, and do not give up, praying frequently and imitating the boldness of the widow who managed to prevail upon the inexorable judge (cf Luke 18:1-5). Then you will walk in the path of the Spirit, impervious to sensual desires, the flow of your prayer unbroken by worldly thoughts, and you will become a temple of God, praising Him undistractedly. If you pray in the mind in this way you will be granted the privilege of attaining mmdfulness of God and will penetrate the innermost sanctuary of the intellect, mystically contemplating the Invisible and alone celebrating in solitude God alone in the unity of divine knowledge and in outpourings of love.</p>
      <p> When you see yourself, therefore, growing sluggish in prayer, take up a book and by paying careful attention to what you read absorb its meaning. Do not read through the words in a cursory fashion, but examine them with depth of understanding and treasure their meaning. Then meditate on what you have read, so that your mind in comprehending it is mellowed and it remains unforgotten. Thus will your ardor for reflection on things divine be kindled, for 'a fire shall be kindled during my meditation' (Ps. 39:3. LXX). just as you have to chew food before you can savor its taste, so you have to ruminate in your soul on holy texts before they enrich and gladden the mind: as the Psalmist says, 'How sweet Thy words are in my throat' (Ps. 119:103). Learn by heart the words of the Gospels and me sayings of</p>
      <p> [V4] 185</p>
      <p> Theoliptos, Metropolitan of Philadelphia</p>
      <p> On Inner Work in Christ And the Monastic Profession</p>
      <p> the blessed fathers, and study their lives diligently, so that you may meditate on these things during the night. In this way when your mind grows listless in prayer you can refresh it by reading and meditating on sacred texts and rekindle its appetite for prayer.</p>
      <p> When chanting psalms, do this in a low voice, with your intellect fully attentive: do not allow any phrase to go uncomprehended. Should anything escape your understanding, begin the verse again, and repeat this as many times as necessary, until your intellect grasps what is being said. For the intellect can attend to the chanting and simultaneously can recollect God. You may learn this from everyday experience: you can meet and speak with someone and also focus your eyes on him. Similarly, you can chant psalms and focus on God through recollectedness.</p>
      <p> Do not neglect prostration. It provides an image of man's fall into sin and expresses the confession of our sinfulness. Getting up, on the other hand, signifies repentance and the promise to lead a life of virtue. Let each</p>
      <p> prostration be accompanied by a noetic invocation of Christ, so that by faUing before the Lord in soul and body you may gain the grace of the God of souls and bodies.</p>
      <p> To dispel sleep and indolence while practicing mental prayer you may occupy your hands with some quiet task, for this, too, contributes to the ascetic struggle. All such tasks when accompanied by prayer quicken the intellect, banish listlessness, give youthful vigor to the soul, and render the intellect more prompt and eager to devote itself to mental work.</p>
      <p> When the wooden sounding-board is struck, leave your cell, your eyes lowered and your mind anchored in mindfulness of God. When you have entered the church and taken your place in the choir, do not indulge in idle talk with the monk next to you or let your intellect be distracted by vain droughts. Secure your tongue with the chanting of psalms and your mind with prayer. After the dismissal, go back to your cell and begin the tasks prescribed for you by your rule.</p>
      <p> When you enter the refectory, do not look round to see how much food your brethren are eating and so fragment your soul with ugly suspicions. Look only at what lies before you; with your mouth eat</p>
      <p> [V4] 186</p>
      <p> Theoliptos, Metropolitan of Philadelphia</p>
      <p> On Inner Work in Christ And the Monastic Profession</p>
      <p> your food, with your ears listen to what is being read, and with your soul pray. Nourishing body and spirit in this way, with your whole being you may truly praise Him who 'satisfies your desire with blessings' (Ps. 103:5. LXX). Then rise and enter your cell with dignity and silence, and like an industrious bee make virtue your labor of love. When you work with the brethren, let your hands do the work while your lips keep silence, and let your intellect be mindful of God. Should someone be prompted to speak idle words, to restore order rise and make a prostration.</p>
      <p> Repulse evil thoughts and do not let than penetrate the heart and settle there; for when passion-imbued thoughts persist they bring the passions themselves to life and are the death of the intellect. As soon as you sense that they are attacking you, try to destroy them with the arrow of prayer. If they go on importuning you to be let in, confusing your mind, now withdrawing, now assailing you again, you may be sure that a prevement desire for them on your part is giving them strength. Because the soul's free will has been overcome in this way, they now have a lawful claim against it, and so they perturb and pester it. Hence you should expose them through confession, for evil thoughts take to flight as soon as they are denounced. Just as darkness recedes when light shines, so the light of confession dispels the darkness of impassioned thoughts. The vanity and self-indulgence that provided an opening for such thoughts are destroyed by the shame felt in confessing them and by the hardship of the penance imposed. Evil thoughts See in confusion when they find the mind already free from passions as a result of continuous, truly contrite prayer.</p>
      <p> When a spiritual athlete tries by means of prayer to cut off the thoughts that agitate him, he is successful for a while and, wrestling and fighting, controls his mental distraction. But he is not delivered completely, because he is still attached to the things that cause these disturbing thoughts - to bodily comfort, that is to say, and to worldly ambition. It is for this reason, indeed, that he is reluctant to confess his thoughts. Thus he is not at peace, for he himself keeps hold of what properly belongs to his enemies. If you retain someone else's goods, will not the rightful</p>
      <p> owner claim them back from you? And if you do not surrender what you wrongfully possess, how can you escape from your adversary? But when the spiritual athlete, strengthened by mindfulness of God, willingly humiliates and ill-treats his mortal self, and confesses his thoughts without shame, the enemy withdraws at</p>

      <p> once, and the mind - now free - enjoys ceaseless prayer and unintermpted meditation on things divine.</p>
      <p> Reject completely every suspicion about someone else that rises in your heart, because it destroys love and peace. But accept with courage any calamity that comes from without, since it provides an opportunity for exercising the patience that leads to salvation, the patience that bestows an abiding-place and repose in heaven.</p>
      <p> If you pass your days in this manner, you will spend this present-life in good heart, glad in the expectation of blessedness; and at death you will leave this world with confidence and be translated to the place of repose that the Lord has prepared for you, granting you as a reward for your present labors the privilege of reigning with Him in His kingdom. To Him be all glory, honor and worship, as also to His unorigmate Father, and to His all-holy, blessed and life-quickening Spirit, now, for ever, and through all the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> 1. When the intellect turns away from external things and concentrates on what is within, it is restored to itself; it is united, that is to say, to the principle of its own consciousness, and through this principle naturally inherent in its own substance it devotes itself entirely to prayer. By means of prayer it ascends with all its loving power and affection to the knowledge of God. Then sensual desire vanishes, every pleasure-inciting sense becomes inert, and the delectable things of earth cease to have any attraction. For once the soul has put behind it all that pertains and is endemic to the body, it pursues the beauty of Christ, engaging in works of devotion and of mental purity. It sings aloud, 'The virgins that follow Him shall be brought to the King' (cf Ps. 45:14. LXX). With Christ's image ever before it, it exclaims, 'I have set the Lord always before me, for He is at my right hand' (Ps. 16:8). It cleaves to Christ with love and cries, 'Lord, all my desire is before Thee' (Ps. 38:9). It continually contemplates Christ, uttering the words, 'My eyes are ever towards the Lord' (Ps. 25:15). Discoursing with Christ in pure prayer it is filled with delight and joy, in accordance with the Psalmist's words, 'My discourse with Him will be full of delight, I will rejoice in the Lord' (Ps. 104 : 34). For God welcomes the discourse bom of prayer, and when He is lovingly invoked and called to our aid. He bestows inexpressible joy on the beseeching soul. For when the soul brings God to mind in the discourse of prayer, it is gladdened by the Lord: again as the Psalmist says, 'I remembered God and was gladdened' (Ps. 77:4. LXX).</p>
      <p> 2. Spurn the senses and you will quell sensual pleasure. Spurn mental fantasies of delectation and you will quell self-indulgent thoughts. For when the intellect remains free from fantasy and image, not permitting itself to be shaped or stamped either by the taints of sensual pleasure or by thoughts full of desire, then it is in a state of</p>
      <p> [V4] 189</p>
      <p> Theoliptos, Metropolitan of Philadelphia Texts</p>
      <p> simplicity; and transcending all sensory and intelligible realities, it concentrates its vision on God. Its sole activity is to invoke the Lord's name in the depth of itself with continuous recollectedness, as a child repeats the name of his father: as it is said in the Scriptures, 'I will invoke the name of the Lord before you' (Exod. 33:19). And as Adam, molded by God's hand from dust, became through divine inspiration a living soul, so the intellect molded by the virtues and repeatedly invoking the Lord with a pure mind and an ardent spirit, is divinely transformed, quickened and deified through knowing and loving God.</p>
      <p> 3.  If through sincere, continual prayer you stand aloof from desire for earthly things, if you repose not with sleep but through abandoning concern with everything except God, being steadfastly rooted solely in mindfulness of God, you will establish in yourself, like another helpmate, love for God. For the cry of the prayer that rises from within you releases divine love; and divine love awakens the intellect, revealing to it what is hidden. Then the intellect, united with love, gives birth to wisdom, and through wisdom proclaims the esoteric meaning of things. For the divine Logos, invoked in the cry of the prayer that rises from within you, lays hold of the noetic power of the intellect as though it were Adam's rib and fills it with divine knowledge; and in its place, bringing to perfection your inner state. He confers the gift of virtue. Next He vivifies light-generating love and brings it to the enraptured intellect as it sleeps a sleep free from all desire for. anything earthly. Love appears as another helpmate to the intellect liberated from mindless attachment to sensory things; it is because of this that it awakens the intellect, now in a state of purity that permits it to embrace the words of wisdom. Then the intellect, gazing on love and filled with delight, speaks at length to others, disclosing to them the hidden dimensions of virtue and the unseen operations of divine knowledge (cf Gen. 2:18, 21-23).</p>
      <p> 4.  Stand aloof from all things sensory, abjuring the law of your unregenerate self, and the spiritual law will be engraved on your mind. As, according to St Paul, the spiritually awakened do not implement the desire of the flesh (cf. Gal. 5:16), so he who stands aloof from the senses and from sensory things - stands aloof, that is to say, from the world and the flesh - is energized by the Spirit and meditates on the things of the Spirit. One can learn of this from God's relationship with Adam prior to the fall.</p>
      <p> [V4] 190</p>
      <p> Theoliptos, Metropolitan of Philadelphia Texts</p>
      <p> 5.  If you struggle to keep the commandments, persisting in the paradise of prayer and cleaving to God through continuous recollection of Him, then God will release you from the self-indulgent proclivities of the flesh, from all</p>
      <p> sensory impulsion and from all forms engraved upon your thought; and rendering you dead to the passions and to sin He will make you a participant in divine life. A sleeping person looks like one dead so far as his bodily activity is concerned, and yet he is alive thanks to the co-operation of his soul. Similarly if you abide in the Spirit you are dead to the world and the flesh, but you live according to the spontaneity of the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 6.  If you grasp the meaning of what you chant you will acquire knowledge. From such knowledge you will attain understanding. From understanding springs the practice of what you know. From practice you will reap abiding spiritual knowledge. Experiential spiritual knowledge gives rise to true contemplation. From true contemplation is bom wisdom, filling the firmament of the mind with refulgent words of grace and elucidating what is hidden to the uninitiated.</p>
      <p> 7.  First the intellect seeks and finds, and then it is united to what it has found. The searching is effectuated by means of the intelligence, the union by means of love. The search by means of the intelligence is undertaken for the sake of truth, the union by means of love is consummated for the sake of sanctity.</p>
      <p> 8.  If you transcend the flow of temporal things and detach yourself from desire for what is transient, you will not notice mundane objects or crave for the delectable things of earth. On the contrary. Supernal visions will be disclosed to you and you will contemplate celestial beauty and the blessedness of unfading realities. To the person who hankers after material things and who steeps himself in sensual pleasure, the heavens are dosed, since his spiritual eyes are shrouded; but he who scorns material things and who repudiates them exalts his intellect and perceives the glory of eternal realities and the luminosity of the saints. Such a person is filled with divine love and becomes a temple of the Holy Spirit; he aspires to do God's will and is guided by the Spirit of God, being granted divine sonship, blessed by God and conforming to Him. 'For all who are guided by the Spirit of God are sons of God'(Rom. 8:14).</p>
      <p> 9.   For as long as you live do not abandon prayer even for a single day on the excuse of illness. Heed St Paul, who says, 'When I am weak, then I am strong' (2 Cor. 12:10). If you act in this spirit, your profit</p>
      <p> [V4] 191</p>
      <p> Theoliptos, Metropolitan of Philadelphia Texts</p>
      <p> will be greater, and the prayer - grace assisting - will soon make you well. Wherever the Spirit brings solace, illness and listlessness are short-lived.</p>

      <p> Nikiphoros the Monk</p>
      <p> (13th century)</p>
      <p> (Volume 4, pp. 192-206)</p>
      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> Nikiphoros the Monk, often known as Nikiphoros the Hesychast or the Athonite, lived in the second hah" of the thirteenth century. He was bom in Italy, so St Gregory Palamas tells us,^ and was originally a Roman Catholic. But, rejecting what Palamas terms the 'kakodoxy' of the Latin West, he travelled to the Byzantine Empire, where he embraced the Orthodox faith, becoming a monk on the Holy Mountain of Athos. Here he dwelt in 'quietness and stillness', according to Palamas - presumably this means that he lived in a small hermitage, not in a fully-organized cenobium - and eventually he withdrew to the 'most isolated parts' of the mountain. Like Theoliptos of Philadelphia, he was fiercely opposed to the unionist policy of Michael VIII,~ and he has himself left an account of the imprisonment and exile that he suffered in consequence during 1276-7.^ Probably he died before 1300.</p>
      <p> The present work.  On Watchfulness and the Guarding of the Heart,  is mentioned by Palamas, who writes: 'Seeing that many beginners were incapable of controlling the instability of their intellect, even to a limited degree, Nikiphoros proposed a method whereby they could restrain to some extent the wanderings of the fantasy.'"* The 'method' in question is closely similar to the psychosomatic technique recommended in  The Three Methods of Prayer,  attributed to St Symeon the New Theologian.^ Nikiphoros is sometimes styled the 'inventor' of this bodily 'method', but Palamas does not actually assert this. It is more</p>

      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> probable that the 'method' had long been traditional on the Holy Mountain and elsewhere, handed down orally from teacher to disciple, and that Nikiphoros - along with the author of  The Three Methods -  did no more than provide the first written descriptions of this technique.</p>
      <p> The main theme of the work On  Watchfulness  is the need to return into oneself, to descend with the intellect into the depths of the heart, and to seek there the hidden treasure of the inner kingdom. After a short anthology of texts, underlining the importance of keeping guard over the intellect, Nikiphoros concludes by suggesting the physical 'method' as a practical way of 'entering the heart' and so achieving this state of spiritual watchfulness. As in  The Three Methods,  the psychosomatic technique, so it seems, is to be practiced before actually commencing the Jesus Prayer. Nikiphoros insists that it is highly desirable to have personal direction from an 'unerring guide', but then recommends the 'method' for those who cannot find such a spiritual director. Most modem Orthodox writers adopt a different view, and consider it dangerous to use this technique except under the immediate instruction of an experienced teacher.</p>
      <p> St Gregory Palamas concedes that Nikiphoros has written 'in a simple and unsophisticated manner'.' Statements about making the intellect descend into the heart, Palamas insists, are not to be interpreted literally, for our mental faculties are not located spatially inside the physical heart 'as in a container'." But there is none the less the genuine correlation - what has sometimes been termed a relationship of 'analogy-participation' - between our physical modalities and our mental or spiritual state: 'After the fall our inner being naturally adapts itself to outward forms.'^ Nikiphoros was therefore correct, Palamas concludes, in suggesting specific ways whereby our bodily energies can be harnessed to the work of prayer.</p>

      <p> [V4] 194</p>
      <p> Nikiphoros the Monk On Watchfulness and the Guarding of the Heart</p>
      <p> If you ardently long to attain the wondrous divine illumination of our Savior Jesus Christ; to experience in your heart the supracelestial fire and to be consciously reconciled with God; to dispossess yourself of worldly things in order to find and possess the treasure hidden in the field of your heart (cf Matt. 13:44); to enkindle here and now your soul's flame and to renounce all that is only here and now; and spiritually to know and experience the kingdom of heaven within you (cf. Luke 17:21): then I will impart to you the science of eternal or heavenly life or, rather, a method that will lead you, if you apply it, painlessly and without toil to the harbor of dispassion, without the danger of being deceived or terrified by the demons. Terror of this kind we experience only when through disobedience we estrange ourselves from the life I am about to describe. This was the fate of Adam when he violated God's commandments: associating with the serpent and trusting him, he was sated by him with the fruits of deceit (cf. Gen. 3:1 -6), and thus wretchedly plunged himself and all those who came after him into the pit of death, darkness and corruption.</p>
      <p> You should, then, return; or - to put it more truly - let us return, brethren, to ourselves, rejecting once and for all with disgust the serpent's counsel and our deflection to what is base. For we cannot be reconciled with God and assimilated to Him unless we first return or, rather, enter into ourselves, in so far as this lies within our power. For the miracle consists in tearing ourselves away from the distraction and vain concerns of the world and in this way relentlessly seizing hold of the kingdom of heaven within us.</p>
      <p> That is why the monastic life has been called the art of arts and the science of sciences. For this holy discipline does not procure us what is corruptible, so that we divert our intellect from higher to lower things</p>
      <p> [V4] 195</p>
      <p> Nikiphoros the Monk On Watchfulness and the Guarding of the Heart</p>
      <p> and completely stifle it. On the contrary it offers us strange, indescribable blessings, that 'the eye has not seen, and the ear has not heard, and man's heart has not grasped' (1 Cor. 2:9). Henceforward 'we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world' (Eph. 6:12). If, then, this present age is one of darkness, let us flee from it. Let us flee from it in our thoughts so that we may have nothing in common with the enemy of God. For if you choose to be a friend of this present age you are an enemy of</p>
      <p> God (cf. Jas. 4:4). And who can help an enemy of God?</p>
      <p> Let us therefore imitate our fathers and like them let us seek the treasure within our hearts. And when we have found it let us hold fast to it with all our might, both cultivating and guarding it (cf. Gen. 2:15); for this is what we were commanded to do from the beginning. And if another Nikodimos should appear and begin to argue, saying, 'How can anyone enter into his own heart and work or dwell in it?' - as the original Nikodimos, doubting the Savior, said, 'How can someone who is old enter the second time into his mother's womb and be bom?' (John 3:4) - let him in his turn hear the words, 'The Spirit blows where He wants to' (John 3:8). If we are full of disbelief and doubt about the practice of the ascetic life, how shall we enjoy the fruits of contemplation? For it is practice that initiates us into contemplation.</p>
      <p> Doubters of this kind cannot be convinced without written evidence. Hence for the benefit of many I will include in this discourse passages from the lives of the saints and from their writings: reading them should dispel all doubt. I will begin at the beginning with St Antony the Great, and then continue with his successors, selecting and setting forth their words and actions as best I can, so as to confirm what I have been saying.</p>
      <p> From the Life of Our Holy Father Antony</p>
      <p> Once two brothers were on their way to visit St Antony, but on the journey their water gave out and one of them died and the other was near to dying. Unable to go any further, he too lay down on the ground</p>
      <p> [V4] 196</p>
      <p> Nikiphoros the Monk On Watchfulness and the Guarding of the Heart</p>
      <p> From the Life of Our Holy Father Antony</p>
      <p> and awaited death. But Antony, seated on the mountain, called two monks who happened to be with him and said to them urgently, 'Take a jar of water and go as fast as you can along the road leading to Egypt: two men were on their way here, but one has just died and the other will also die if you don't hurry. This was revealed to me as I was praying.' The monks set off; and finding the one man dead they buried him, while they revived the other with water and brought him to the elder. It was about a day's journey off. Should you ask why Antony did not speak before the first man died, I would say that the question is inapt: the decision about death rested not with Antony but with God, and He allowed the first man to die and sent a revelation to St Antony about the second. The miracle happened to St Antony, and to him alone, because while seated on the mountain he kept his heart watchful, and so the Lord showed him what was happening a long way off</p>
      <p> Do you see how through watchfulness of heart St Antony was able to perceive God and to acquire the power of clairvoyance? For it is in the heart that God manifests Himself to the intellect, first - according to St John Klmiakos -as fire that purifies the lover and then as light that illumines the intellect and renders it godlike.</p>
      <p> From the Life of St Theodosios the Cenobiarch</p>
      <p> St Theodosios was so deeply wounded by the sweet arrow of love, and was held so fast in love's fetters, that he fulfilled in actual practice the exalted commandment, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind' (Matt. 22:37). Such a state can be attained only by so concentrating the soul's natural powers that they aspire to nothing other than the Creator alone. So great were these spiritual energies in his soul that when exhorting someone he often inspired awe; yet when giving</p>
      <p> [V4] 197</p>
      <p> Nikiphoros the Monk On Watchfulness and the Guarding of the Heart</p>
      <p> From the Life of St Theodosios the Cenobiarch</p>
      <p> rebukes he was always gentle and tender. Who else could talk with so many people and be of such service to them, or could so concentrate their senses and turn them inwards that in the midst of tumult they lived with greater serenity than did those in the desert'? Who else could remain just the same whether among crowds or dwelling alone? It was by thus concentrating the senses and turning them inwards that the great Theodosios came to be wounded by love for the Creator.</p>
      <p> From the Life of St Arsenios</p>
      <p> St Arsenios made it a rule never to discuss things in writing and never to send letters. This was not out of weakness or incapacity - how could it have been, seeing that he could speak eloquently with as much ease as others displayed when speaking in a normal way? But it was due to his long habit of silence and his dislike of self-display. For the same reason he took great care when in church or at any other gathering not to look at other people or to be seen by them; he would stand behind a column or some other obstruction and hide himself from view, remaining unseen and not mixing with others. This holy man and earthly angel acted like this because he too wanted to keep a strict watch on himself and to concentrate his intellect inwardly so that he could raise himself towards God without impediment.</p>
      <p> From the Life of St Paul of Mount Latros</p>
      <p> Although the divine Paul always lived in the mountains and in desert places, and shared his solitude and his food with wild animals, there were nevertheless times when he went down to the Lavra in order to visit the brethren. He counseled them, exhorting them not to be fainthearted and not to neglect the assiduous practice of the virtues.</p>
      <p> [V4] 198</p>
      <p> Nikiphoros the Monk On Watchfulness and the Guarding of the Heart</p>
      <p> From the Life of St Paul of Mount Latros</p>
      <p> but to persevere with all attentiveness and discrimination in their efforts to live according to the Gospels and in their courageous fight against the spirits of evil. He also taught them a method by which they could expunge ingrained passion-imbued dispositions as well as counteract new seeds of passion.</p>
      <p> You see how this holy father teaches his uninitiated disciples a method through which they could ward off the attacks of the passions? This method was none other than the art of keeping watch over the intellect, for it is only by keeping such watch that we can ward off the passions.</p>
      <p> From the Life of St Savvas</p>
      <p> When St Savvas saw that a monk had thoroughly mastered the rules of monastic conduct, and was already able to keep watch over his intellect and fight off demonic thoughts - had indeed banished from his mind all memory of worldly things - then, if this monk was physically weak and ill, St Savvas allowed him to have a cell in the Lavra. But if such a monk was vigorous and in good health, he told him to build his own cell.</p>
      <p> Do you see how the divine Sawas, too, required his disciples to keep watch over the intellect and only then permitted them to dwell by themselves in their own cells? What are we doing who idly sit in our cells without even knowing whether there is such an art as keeping watch over the intellect?</p>
      <p> From the Life of Abba Agathon</p>
      <p> One of the brethren asked Abba Agathon which is the better, bodily asceticism or the guarding of our inner state. The elder replied: 'Man is</p>
      <p> [V4] 199</p>
      <p> Nikiphoros the Monk On Watchfulness and the Guarding of the Heart</p>
      <p> From the Life of Abba Agathon</p>
      <p> like a tree: bodily asceticism is the leaves, the guarding of our inner state the fruit. Since, according to the Scriptures, "every tree that fails to produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire" (Matt. 3:10), it is clear that all our efforts should be devoted to producing the fruit, that is, to keeping watch over our intellect. But we also need the shelter and canopy of the leaves - bodily asceticism.'</p>
      <p> How astonishing it is that this saint denounced those who fail to learn how to keep watch over the intellect and who boast only of their bodily asceticism: every tree, he said, which does not produce fruit - by which is meant keeping watch over the intellect - but only has leaves, that is, bodily asceticism, is cut down and thrown into the fire. How terrible, father, is your verdict.</p>
      <p> From Abba Mark's Letter to Nicolas</p>
      <p> If, my son, you wish to acquire within yourseh" your own lamp of noetic light and spiritual knowledge, so as to walk without stumbling in the dark night of this age; and if you wish your steps to be ordered by the Lord, delighting in the way of the Gospel - that is, desiring with ardent faith, with zeal and prayer, to practice the commandments of the Gospel - then I will show you a wonderful spiritual method to help you achieve this. It does not call for bodily exertion, but requires spiritual effort, control of the intellect, and an attentive understanding, assisted by fear and love of God. Through this method you can easily put to flight the cohorts of the enemy. If, then, you wish to triumph over the passions, enter within yourself through prayer and with the help of God. Descend into the depths of the heart, and search out the three powerful giants - forgetfulness, sloth and ignorance - which enable the rest of the evil passions to infiltrate into the self-indulgent soul, and to live, energize and flourish there. Then through strict attentiveness and control of the intellect, together with help from above, you will track down these evil giants, about which most people are ignorant; and so you will be able to free yourself from them by means of strict attentiveness and prayer. For when, through the action</p>
      <p> [V4] 200</p>
      <p> Nikiphoros the Monk On Watchfulness and the Guarding of the Heart</p>
      <p> From Abba Mark's Letter to Nicolas</p>
      <p> of grace, zeal for true knowledge, for mindfulness of God's words and for genuine concord is diligently planted and cultivated in the heart, then the last traces of forgetfulness, ignorance and sloth are expunged from it.</p>
      <p> Observe how admirably different spiritual teachings concur, and how clearly they explain the meaning of prayer.</p>
      <p> From St John Klimakos</p>
      <p> A hesychast is one who strives to enshrine what is bodiless within the temple of the body, paradoxical though this may sound. A hesychast is one who says, T sleep but my heart is watchful' (Song of Songs 5:2). Close the door of your cell to the body, the door of your tongue to speech, and your inner gate to evil spirits. Ascend into a watchtower - if you know how to - and observe how and when and whence, and in what numbers and what form, the robbers try to break in and steal your grapes. When the watchman grows weary he stands up and prays; then he sits down again and manfully resumes the same task. Guarding against evil thoughts is one thing, keeping watch over the intellect is another. The latter differs from the former as much as east from west, and is far more difficult to attain. Where thieves see royal weapons at the ready they do not attack the place lightly. Similarly, spiritual robbers do not lightly try to plunder the person who has enshrined prayer within his heart.</p>
      <p> Do you see how these words reveal the wonderful inner work of this great father? We, on the other hand, walk in darkness and as though in some midnight brawl tread these soul-saving words of the Spirit underfoot, spuming them as though willfully deaf But now in the passages that follow see what the fathers set down for us as guidance in the</p>
      <p> attaining of watchfulness. [V4] 201</p>
      <p> Nikiphoros the Monk On Watchfulness and the Guarding of the Heart</p>
      <p> From St Isaiah the SoHtary</p>
      <p> When a man severs himself from evil, he gains an exact understanding of all the sins he has committed against God; for he does not see his sins unless he severs himself from them with a feeling of revulsion. Those who have reached this level pray to God with tears, and are filled with shame when they recall their evil love of the passions. Let us therefore pursue the spiritual way with all our strength, and God in His great mercy will help us. And if we have not guarded our hearts as our fathers guarded theirs, at least in obedience to God let us do all we can to keep our bodies sinless, trusting that at this time of spiritual dearth He will grant mercy to us together with His saints.</p>
      <p> Here then this great father encourages those who are very weak, saying that, even if we have not guarded our hearts as the fathers have done, let us at least keep our bodies free from sin, as God demands, and He will be merciful to us. Great is the compassion and sympathy of such a father.</p>
      <p> From St Makarios the Great</p>
      <p> The most important task for an ascetic is to enter into his heart, to wage war against Satan, to hate him, and to battle with him by wrestling against the thoughts he provokes. If you keep your body outwardly chaste and pure, but inwardly are adulterous where God is concerned and profligate in your thoughts, then you gain nothing from keeping your body chaste. For it is written, 'Whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart' (Matt. 5:28). In other words, you can fornicate through the body, and you also fornicate when your soul communes with Satan.</p>
      <p> [V4] 202</p>
      <p> Nikiphoros the Monk On Watchfulness and the Guarding of the Heart</p>
      <p> From St Makarios the Great</p>
      <p> This great father seems to contradict the words of St Isaiah quoted above. Yet this is not the case, for St Makarios exhorts us also to guard our body in the way that God requires. But he asks us to keep pure not only our body but our spirit as well. Thus he too enjoins what the Gospel commandments stipulate.</p>
      <p> From St Diadochos</p>
      <p> He who dwells continually within his own heart is detached from the attractions of this world, for he lives in the Spirit and cannot know the desires of the flesh. Such a man henceforward patrols the fortress of the virtues, posting them as watchmen at all the gates. The assaults of the demons are now ineffective against him.</p>
      <p> Rightly does the saint say that the assaults of the demons are now ineffective - ineffective, that is, when we dwell in the depth of our own hearts, and the more so the longer we dwell there. But I lack time to cite here extracts from all the fathers, so I will add one or two more and bring this work to a close.</p>
      <p> From St Isaac the Syrian</p>
      <p> Strive to enter the shrine within you and you will see the shrine of heaven, for the one is the same as the other, and a single entrance permits you to contemplate both. The ladder leading to that kingdom is hidden within you, that is, within your soul: cleanse yourself from sin and there you will find the steps by which to ascend.</p>
      <p> [V4] 203</p>
      <p> Nikiphoros the Monk On Watchfulness and the Guarding of the Heart</p>
      <p> From St John of Karpathos</p>
      <p> A great effort and much toil are needed in prayer before we can reach a state in which our mind is no longer troubled, and so attain the inward heaven of the heart where Christ dwells. As St Paul says, 'Do you not realize that Christ dwells within you, unless you are worthless?' (cf 2 Cor. 13:5).</p>
      <p> From St Symeon the New Theologian</p>
      <p> After the devil and his demons had brought about man's exile from paradise and from God by making him transgress, they found they could inwardly derange - to a greater or lesser extent - anyone's reason whenever they wanted to. The only defense against this is the ceaseless mmdfulness of God, for if such mmdfulness is stamped on the heart through the power of the cross it will render our thought steadfast and unshakeable. This is a state to which the spiritual contest of every Christian who enters the arena of Christ's faith should lead, if he is not to struggle in vain. For it is to achieve this state that God's athlete embraces all the various forms of ascetic practice. He embraces them so as to call down God's mercy upon him, that Christ may restore him to his original status and may be set as a seal on his mind. This accords with St Paul's words, 'My little children, for you I again bear the pangs of birth, until Christ is formed in you' (Gal. 4:19).</p>
      <p> Have you grasped, brethren, that there is a spiritual art or method swiftly leading whoever pursues it to dispassion and the vision of God? Are you convinced that every external form of asceticism is regarded by God as the foliage</p>
      <p> of a fruitless tree and will be of no benefit to the [V4] 204</p>
      <p> Nikiphoros the Monk On Watchfulness and the Guarding of the Heart</p>
      <p> From St Symeon the New Theologian</p>
      <p> soul that is not capable of guarding the intellect? Let us then strive not to die fruitless, and thereafter repent to no purpose.</p>
      <p> Question:  From what has been said we have learned not only of the practice of those who live in accordance with God's will but also that there is a certain fonn of action that speedily frees the soul from passions and unites it to love for God, and that everyone who engage in spiritual warfare must adopt this form. About these things we have no doubt and are quite convinced. But we are anxious to know what exactly attentiveness is and how we may acquire it, for of this we are altogether ignorant.</p>
      <p> Response:  In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ who said 'Without Me you can do nothing' (John 15:5), having invoked His help and assistance, I will do my best to show you what attentiveness is and how, if God wills, it may be attained.</p>
      <p> From Nikiphoros Himself</p>
      <p> Some of the saints have called attentiveness the guarding of the intellect others have called it custody of the heart, or watchfulness, or noetic stillness, and others something else. All these expressions indicate one and the same thing, just as 'bread' and 'a round' or 'a slice' do; and you should read them in this sense. As to what attentiveness itself is and what its characteristics are, this you can now learn in more detail.</p>
      <p> Attentiveness is the sign of true repentance. It is the soul's restoration, hatred of the world, and return to God. It is rejection of sin and recovery of virtue. It is the unreserved assurance that our sins are forgiven. It is the beginning of contemplation or, rather, its presupposition, for through it God, descrying its presence in us reveals Himself to the intellect. It is serenity of intellect or, rather, the repose bestowed on the soul through God's mercy. It is the subjection of our thoughts, the palace of the mmdfulness of God, the stronghold that enables us patiently to accept all that befalls. It is the ground of faith, hope and love. For if you do not have faith you cannot endure the outward afflictions that assail you; and if you do not bear them gladly you cannot say to the Lord, 'Thou art my helper and my refuge' (Ps 91:2).</p>
      <p> [V4] 205</p>
      <p> Nikiphoros the Monk</p>
      <p> On Watchfulness and the Guarding of the Heart</p>
      <p> From Nikiphoros Himself</p>
      <p> And if the Most High is not your refuge you wiU not lay up His love in your heart.</p>
      <p> Most if not all of those who attain this greatest of gifts do so chiefly through being taught. To be sure, a few without being taught receive it directly from God through the ardor of their endeavor and the fervor of their faith; but what is rare does not constitute the norm. That is why we should search for an unerring guide, so that under his instruction we may learn how to deal with the shortcomings and exaggerations suggested to us by the devil whenever we deviate left or right from the axis of attentiveness. Since such a guide will himself have been tested through what he has suffered, he will be able to make these things clear to us and will unambiguously disclose the spiritual path to us so that we can follow it easily. If you have no such guide you must diligently search for one. If, however, no guide is to be found, you must renounce worldly attachments, call on God with a contrite spirit and with tears, and do what I tell you.</p>
      <p> You know that what we breathe is air. When we exhale it, it is for the heart's sake, for the heart is the source of life and warmth for the body. The heart draws towards itself the air inhaled when breathing, so that by discharging some of its heat when the air is exhaled it may maintain an even temperature. The cause of this process or, rather, its agent, are the lungs. The Creator has made these capable of expanding and contracting, like bellows, so that they can easily draw in and expel their contents. Thus, by taking in coolness and expelling heat through breathing, the heart performs unobstructed the function for which it was created, that of maintaining life.</p>
      <p> Seat yourself, then, concentrate your intellect, and lead it into the respiratory passage through which your breath passes into your heart. Put pressure on your intellect and compel it to descend with your inhaled breath into your heart. Once it has entered there, what follows will be neither dismal nor glum. Just as a man, after being far away from home, on his return is overjoyed at being with his wife and children again, so the intellect, once it is united with the soul, is filled with indescribable delight.</p>
      <p> Therefore, brother, train your intellect not to leave your heart quickly, for at first it is strongly disinclined to remain constrained and circumscribed in this way. But once it becomes accustomed to remaining there, it can no longer bear to be outside the heart. For the kingdom of heaven is within us (cf Luke 17:21); and when the</p>
      <p> [V4] 206</p>
      <p> Nikiphoros the Monk On Watchfulness and the Guarding of the Heart</p>
      <p> From Nikiphoros Himself</p>
      <p> intellect concentrates its attention in the heart and through pure prayer searches there for the kingdom of heaven, all external things become abominable and hateful to it. If, then, after your first attempts you enter through your intellect into the abode of the heart in the way that I have explained, give thanks and glory to God, and exult in Him. Continually persevere in this practice and it will teach you what you do not know.</p>
      <p> Moreover, when your intellect is firmly established in your heart, it must not remain there silent and idle; it should constantly repeat and meditate on the prayer, 'Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me', and should never stop doing this. For this prayer protects the intellect from distraction, renders it impregnable to diabolic attacks, and</p>
      <p> every day increases its love and desire for God.</p>
      <p> If, however, in spite of all your efforts you are not able to enter the realms of the heart in the way I have enjoined, do what I now tell you and with God's help you will find what you seek. You know that everyone's discursive faculty is centered in his breast; for when our lips are silent we speak and deliberate and formulate prayers, psalms and other things in our breast. Banish, then, all thoughts from this faculty - and you can do this if you want to - and in their place put the prayer, 'Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me', and compel it to repeat this prayer ceaselessly. If you continue to do this for some time, it will assuredly open for you the entrance to your heart in the way we have explained, and as we ourselves know from experience.</p>
      <p> Then, along with the attentiveness you have so wished for, the whole choir of the virtues - love, joy, peace and the others (cf Gal. 5:22) - will come to you. Through the virtues all your petitions will be answered in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom with the Father and the Holy Spirit be glory, power, honor and worship now and always and throughout the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> St Gregory of Sinai</p>
      <p> (c. 1265-1346)</p>
      <p> (Volume 4, pp. 207-286)</p>
      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> Orthodox mystical theology in the mid-fourteenth century possesses as its crowning glory the two Gregories: St Gregory of Sinai and St Gregory Palamas.^ Although they were on the Holy Mountain of Athos at the same time, it is uncertain how far they were in personal contact.' Gregory of Sinai was bom, probably around 1265 (but the date is uncertain), near Klazomenai, on the western shores of Asia Minor. Taken prisoner as a young man in a Turkish raid, after being ransomed he went to Cyprus, where he entered the first grade of the monastic life, becoming a rasophore. Next he travelled to Sinai, where he received full monastic profession. From here he went to Crete, where - according to his disciple and biographer Patriarch Kallistos I - he learned from a monk called Arsenios about the 'guarding of the intellect, true watchfulness and pure prayer': in other words, he was initiated into that tradition of inner prayer - including the Jesus Prayer - to which the writings in  The Philokalia  bear witness.</p>
      <p> After this St Gregory moved to Mount Athos, perhaps around the turn of the century, where he remained for the next twenty-five years. Like Nikiphoros the Monk,^ he chose to live not in one of the large cenobia but in a secluded hermitage, settling in the  skete  of Magoula, not far from the monastery of Philotheou. Turkish incursions forced him to leave Athos around 1325-8, although he returned there briefly during the 1330's. He played no direct part in the hesychast dispute which broke out around 1335, and in which his namesake St Gregory Palamas was deeply involved; probably it was by deliberate choice that</p>

      <p> ' See David Balfour, 'Was St Gregory Palamas St Gregory the Sinafte's Pupil?',  St Vladimir's Theological Quarterly  xxviii (1984), pp. 115-30. Balfour answers this question with an emphatic 'yes', but many of his ai'guments remain speculative.</p>

      <p> St Gregory of Sinai</p>
      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> he avoided controversy and polemics. But there can be no doubt that his own theological standpoint, although less explicitly developed, agrees fundamentally with that of Palamas on all essential points. This is confirmed by the  Discourse on the Transfiguration,  recently edited by David Balfour, in which the Sinaite clearly speaks of the light of Tabor as divine and uncreated. The last years of his life were spent in the remote wilderness of Paroria, in the Strandzha Mountains on the border between the Byzantine Empire and Bulgaria, where he enjoyed the patronage of John Alexander, Tsar of Bulgaria. Here he gathered round him a large group of disciples, both Greeks and Slavs, and here he died on 27 November 1346.''</p>
      <p> St Makarios and St Nikodimos have included five works by the Sinaite in  The Philokalia.  Since their titles vary widely in the manuscripts and they are cited in different ways by modem writers, it will be helpful to list them here, giving first the titles used in our translation, and then the Latin titles used in Migne:</p>
      <p> (I)  On Commandments and Doctrines, Warnings and Promises; on Thoughts, Passions and Virtues, and also on Stillness and Prayer: One Hundred and Thirty-Seven Texts; Migne: Capita vaide utilia per acrostichidem (P.G.  cl, 1240-1300). In the Greek original, the initial letters of each text form an acrostic, spelling out the title of the work. The subject matter, as the title indicates, is extremely varied; the work is concerned mainly with ascetic practice rather than inner prayer.</p>
      <p> (II)  Further Texts; Migne: Alia Capita (P.G.  cl, 130a—4). Seven texts, forming a short supplement to (I).</p>
      <p> (III) On the Signs of Grace and Delusion, Written for the Confessor Longinos: Ten Texts;  Migne:  De quiete et</p>
      <p> oratione (P.G.  cl, 1304-12). In this and the two following works, St Gregory discusses more particularly inner prayer, especially the Jesus Prayer, as well as indicating how to distinguish between experiences that come from God and those emanating from the demons or the fallen self. Nothing is known about the Longinos to whom this third treatise is addressed, but he was presumably one of Gregory's monastic colleagues or disciples. Gregory terms him  ar]fiEio(p6pog,  which means literally</p>

Tachiaos, 'Gregory Sinaites' legacy to the Slavs: Preliminary Remarks', Cyrillomethodianum  vii (1983), pp. 113-65.</p>
      <p> [V4] 209</p>
      <p> St Gregory of Sinai</p>
      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> 'standard-bearer', 'ensign'; in Christian authors, it can signify a confessor for the faith or a miracle-worker. Perhaps Longinos, like Theoliptos of Philadelphia and Nikiphoros the Monk, suffered for the Orthodox faith under the unionist Emperor Michael VIII.</p>
      <p> (IV)  On Stillness: Fifteen Texts; Migne: De quietudine et duobis orationis modis (P.G. cl,  1313-29). This work contains a lengthy section on psalmody (§§ 5-9). The manuscripts disagree concerning the recipient, who is variously named 'Joachim the Vigilant', 'Niphon the Hesychast', 'brother Philotheos of the same mountain of Sinai'. It is extremely unlikely that Gregory wrote this work while still at Sinai, before being initiated into inner prayer by the monk Arsenios; but it is of course possible that, while on Athos or at Paroria, he continued to maintain contact with monks whom he had met at Sinai. All three of these persons are otherwise unknown to us, but clearly they are monks.</p>
      <p> (V)  On Prayer: Seven Texts; Migne: Quomodo oporteat sedere hesychastam ad orationem nee cito assurgere (P.G.  cl, 1329-45). This includes a section on food (§ 6). No name of any addressee is mentioned in the manuscripts. The work has a warm and friendly tone and was obviously intended for a real individual, who is said</p>
      <p> to be advanced in years (§ 6). Gregory is forthright in his demands, but speaks to the recipient in respectful and encouraging terms. ^</p>
      <p> None of these works contains any indication of date or place, and so it is impossible to say at what point in St Gregory's career they were composed; but from their tone it seems likely that they were written towards the end of his life, either during his last years on Athos or at Paroria. Clearly he had a monastic audience in mind, and was writing for hesychasts dwelling alone or in hermitages rather than for cenobites in large, fully organized communities.</p>
      <p> Patriarch Kallistos, in his  Life  of St Gregory, emphasizes the Sinaite's austerity in his earlier years and his radiant joy and loving kindness at the end of his life. Both of these characteristics are evident in the texts that follow. The daily programme that Gregory proposes for the</p>

For works (III)-(V) we have been able to consult a preliminary draft of the forthcoming critical edition of Gregory of Sinai, in course of preparation by Dr Hans-Veit Beyer of the Kommission fur Byzantinistik attached to the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna. We look foiTvai'd eagerly to its eventual publication.</p>
      <p> [V4] 210</p>
      <p> St Gregory of Sinai Introductory Note</p>
      <p> hesychast is daunting in its severity (I, 99, 101),^ and he is strict and uncompromising in his analysis of delusion (I, 131-2, 135; III, 10; V, 7), in his warnings about the coming judgment (I, 34-40), his strictures upon the passions (I, 62-5, 70-9, 110), and his demand for total humility (I, 115, 117). But he speaks also about the 'warmth of heart' which marks 'the beginning of prayer' (IV, 10), and about the exultation, rapture and ecstasy to which, by God's grace, the inner pilgrimage of the hesychast eventually leads (I, 58-9, 113, 118; III, 3, 5, 9). True to the apophatic tradition of inner prayer, the Sinaite requires a resolute 'shedding' of images and thoughts (I, 118; III, 3; IV, 9; V, 7),' yet he allows an important place to feelings - although without any trace of sentimental emotionalism. Although he is deliberately reticent when referring to the transfiguring vision of the divine light (I, 23, 116, 118), and is careful to warn the reader against the ever- present danger of delusion by false visions of light (III, 3; IV, 10),'' it is evident that he stands in the same spiritual tradition as St Symeon the New Theologian and St Gregory Palamas.</p>
      <p> In his teaching upon inner prayer, the Sinaite assigns a central place to the invocation of the name of Jesus. This is to be practised 'under spiritual guidance' (III, 3; cf IV, 15), that is to say, under the immediate direction of an experienced spiritual father. Gregory recommends the psychosomatic technique, but provides no detailed instructions; probably he considered that these were best supplied orally and on a personal basis by each spiritual guide to his immediate disciples. Whereas Nikiphoros and  The Three Methods  seem to regard the technique as a preliminary exercise, preceding the actual invocation, Gregory's language suggests that the control of the breathing is to be simultaneous with the recitation of the Prayer, although he does not explain exactly how the two are to be coordinated (IV, 2; V, 1). Although endorsing the use of the bodily technique, he sees it as limited in value (V, 3, 7). He allows a certain flexibility as regards the precise formula of prayer that is to be employed, but he discourages the hesychast from making constant changes in the wording: 'For</p>
      <p> ' In references to Gregory's writings, the number of the work is given first in Roman numerals, followed by the number of the section in Arabic figures. Thus I, 99 signifies On  Commandments and Doctrines, text  99.</p>

      <p> plants which are frequently transplanted do not put down roots' (IV, 2; Cf V, 2).'</p>
      <p> Of particular interest is the way in which St Gregory connects the Jesus Prayer with the sacrament of baptism. Prayer, he states, is 'baptism made manifest' (I, 113; cf I, 129). The aim of the Jesus Prayer, as of all prayer, is to reveal in a conscious and dynamically active way 'the energy of the Holy Spirit, which we have already mystically received in baptism' (III, 3). Through the invocation of the Holy Name, we are enabled to pass from the stage when baptismal grace is present in our hearts merely in a hidden and unconscious manner, to the point of full awareness at which we experience the activity of this grace directly and consciously. While emphasizing the indwelling presence of Christ through baptism, Gregory does not make any explicit connection between the Jesus Prayer and the eucharist, as we might have expected him to do. But in other contexts he does employ eucharistic imagery, speaking of prayer as an inner liturgy celebrated in the sanctuary of the heart, and likening the soul to a 'noetic altar' on which the Lamb of God is offered in mystical sacrifice (I, 112; Cf, I, 43)."</p>
      <p> ' In the manuscripts of Gregory's works there are many minor variations in the formulae given for the Jesus Prayer, and it is impossible to be sure exactly what words Gregory recommended.

      <p> 1.  You cannot be or become spiritually intelligent in the way that is natural to man in his pre-fallen state unless you first attain purity and freedom from corruption. For our purity has been overlaid by a state of sense-dominated mmdlessness, and our original incorruption by the corruption of the flesh.</p>
      <p> 2.  Only those who through their purity have become saints are spiritually intelligent in the way that is natural to man in his pre-fallen state. Mere skill in reasoning does not make a person's intelligence pure, for since the fall our intelligence has been corrupted by evil thoughts. The materialistic and wordy spirit of the wisdom of this world may lead us to speak about ever wider spheres of knowledge, but it renders our thoughts increasingly crude and uncouth. This combination of well-informed talk and crude thought falls far short of real wisdom and contemplation, as well</p>
      <p> as of undivided and unified knowledge.</p>
      <p> 3.  By knowledge of truth understand above all apprehension of tmth through grace. Other kinds of knowledge should be regarded as images of intellections or the rational demonstration of facts.</p>
      <p> 4.  If you fail to receive grace it is because of your lack of faith and your negligence; if you find it again it is because of your faith and your diligence. For faith and diligence always conduce to progress, while their opposites do the reverse.</p>
      <p> 5.   To be utterly senseless is like being dead, and to be blind in intellect is like not seeing physically. To be utterly senseless is to be deprived of life-giving energizing power; to be blind in intellect is to be</p>

      <p> St Gregory of Sinai On Commandments and Doctrines, Warnings and Promises; On Thoughts, Passions and Virtues, and Also on Stillness and Prayer: One Hundred and Thirty-Seven Texts</p>
      <p> deprived of the divine light by which a man can see and be seen by God.</p>
      <p> 6.  Few men receive both power and wisdom from God. Through power we partake of divine blessings; through wisdom we manifest them. This participation and this communication to others is a truly divine gift, beyond man's unaided capacity.</p>
      <p> 7.  A true sanctuary, even before the life to come, is a heart free from distractive thoughts and energized by the Spirit, for all is done and said there spiritually. If we do not attain such a state in this life, we may because of our other virtues be a stone fit for building into the temple of God; but we will not ourselves be a temple or a celebrant of the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 8.   Man is created incorruptible, without bodily humors, and thus he will be when resurrected. Yet he is not created either immutable or mutable, since he possesses the power to choose at will whether to be subject to change or not But the will cannot confer total immutability of nature upon him. Such immutability is bestowed only when he has attained the state of changeless deification.</p>
      <p> 9.  Corruption is generated by the flesh. To feed, to excrete, to stride about and to sleep are the natural characteristics of beasts and wild animals; acquiring these characteristics through the fall, we have become beastlike, losing the natural blessings bestowed on us by God. We have become brutal instead of spiritually intelligent, ferine instead of godlike.</p>
      <p> 10.  Paradise is twofold - sensible and spiritual: there is the paradise of Eden and the paradise of grace. The paradise of Eden is so exalted that it is said to extend to the third heaven. It has been planted by God with every kind of sweet-scented plant. It is neither entirely free from comiption nor altogether subject to it. Created between corruption and mcorruption, it is always rich in fruits, ripe and unripe, and continually full of flowers. When trees and ripe fruit rot and fall to the ground they turn into sweet-scented soil, free from the smell of decay exuded by the vegetable-matter of this world. That is because of the great richness and holiness of the grace ever abounding there. The river Ocean, appointed always to irrigate paradise with its waters, flows through the middle of it.

      <p> 11.  It is said that when the world was first created it was not subject to flux and corruption. According to Scripture it was only later corrupted and 'made subject to vanity' - that is, to man - not by its own choice but by the will of Him to whom it is subject, the expectation being that Adam, who had fallen into corruption, would be restored to his original state (cf Rom. 8:20-21). For by renewing man and sanctifying him, even though in this transient life he bears a corruptible body. God also renewed creation, although creation is not yet freed from the process of corruption. This deliverance from corruption is said by some to be a translation to a better state, by others to require a complete transmutation of everything sensory. Scripture generally makes simple and straightforward statements about matters that are still obscure.</p>
      <p> 12.  People who have received grace are as if impregnated and with child by the Holy Spirit; but they may abort the divine seed through sinning, or divorce themselves from God through intercourse with the enemy lurking within them. It is the turbulence of the passions that aborts grace, while the act of sinning deprives us of it altogether. A passion- and sin-loving soul, shorn of grace and divorced from God, is the haunt of passions - not to say of demons -in this world and the next.</p>
      <p> 13.   Nothing so converts anger into joy and gentleness as courage and mercy. Like a siege-engine, courage shatters enemies attacking the soul from without, mercy those attacking it from within.</p>
      <p> 14.  Many who practice the commandments think they are following the spiritual path. But they have not yet reached the city, and in fact remain outside it. For they travel foolishly, deviating unawares from the straight highway into side-roads, not realizing how close the vices are to the path of virtue. For the trae fulfillment of the commandments demands that we do neither too little nor too much but simply pursue a course acceptable to God and in accordance with His will. Otherwise we labor in vain and do not make straight the paths of the Lord (cf. Isa. 40:3). For in everything we do we must be clear about the goal we are pursuing.</p>
      <p> 15.  To be on the spiritual path means seeking the Lord in your heart through fulfilling the commandments. For when you listen to John the Baptist crying in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord,</p>
      <p> [V4] 215</p>
      <p> St Gregory of Sinai On Commandments and Doctrines, Warnings and Promises; On Thoughts, Passions and Virtues, and Also on Stillness and Prayer: One Hundred and Thirty-Seven Texts</p>
      <p> make His paths straight' (Matt. 3:3), you must understand that he is referring to the commandments and their fulfillment both in the heart and in actions. It is impossible to 'make straight' the path of the commandments and to act rightly unless your heart too is straight and upright.</p>
      <p> 16.   When Scripture speaks of rod and staff (cf. Ps. 23:4), you should take these to signify in the prophetic sense judgment and providence, and in the moral sense psalmody and prayer. For when we are chastened by the Lord with me rod of correction (cf 1 Cor. 11:32), this is so that we may learn how to mend our ways. And when we chasten our assailants with the rod of dauntless psalmody, we become established in prayer. Since we thus wield the rod and the staff of spiritual action, let us not cease to chasten and be chastened until we are wholly in the hands of providence and escape judgment both now and hereafter.</p>
      <p> 17.  The essence of the commandments is always to give precedence to the one that embraces them all: mindfulness of God, as stipulated in the phrase, 'Always be mindful of the Lord your God' (cf. Deut. 8:18). Our failure or success in keeping the commandments depends on such mindfulness, for it is this that forgetfulness first destroys when it shrouds the commandments in darkness and strips us of every blessing.</p>
