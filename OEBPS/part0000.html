	 <p>Introduction to the Philokalia Volume 1</p>
	 <p>The Philokalia is a collection of texts written between the fourth and the fifteenth centuries by spiritual masters of the Orthodox Christian tradition. It was compiled in the eighteenth century by two Greek monks, St Nikodimos of the Holy Mountain of Athos (1749-1809) and St Makarios of Corinth (1731-1805), and was first published at Venice in 1782. A second edition was published at Athens in 1893, and this included certain additional texts on prayer by Patriarch Kallistos not found in the 1782 edition. A third edition, in five volumes, was also published at Athens during the years 1957-1963 by the Astir Publishing Company. It is on the Astir edition that our English translation is based. Thus our translation, which we likewise hope to publish in five volumes, will reproduce all the texts included in the three Greek editions. </p>

	 <p>We depart notably from these editions in but four respects. First, we have not included the introduction written by St Nikodimos, and we have rewritten the notes which he placed before each text or series of texts written by a single author.</p>

	 <p>Second, we have used a more reliable version of a text if one is now available. Where that has been the case, we signify it in the relevant introductory note.</p>

	 <p>Third, we have attributed to Evagrios the work On Prayer, which in the Greek editions is 
attributed to St Neilos; the explanation for this change of attribution is in the note preceding 
Evagrios' texts.</p>

	 <p>Fourth, we have placed in an appendix the text, attributed to St Antony the Great, which opens the Greek editions; the reasons for this decision are likewise stated in the note introducing that text. Where certain passages, or indeed entire sections, of individual texts attributed by St Nikodimos to particular authors are now known or suspected to have been written by other hands, we have indicated this either in the introductory notes to the texts in question or in footnotes. But in no case have we excised any such passage or section on the grounds that it is not by the author to whom St Nikodimos has attributed it. The distinction between genuine and spurious where all these writings are concerned must rest, not on the correctness of the attribution of their authorship, but on whether or not they belong to the spiritual tradition which the collection as a whole represents.</p>
   <p> All the texts in the original Philokalia are in Greek, and all except two were first written in Greek, and even these two (written originally in Latin) were translated into Greek in Byzantine times. But the influence of the work has by no means been confined to the Greek-speaking world. It was Paisii Velichkovskii (1722-1794), a Russian monk who visited Mount Athos and later settled in Moldavia, who first translated a selection of the texts into Slavonic, published, with the title Dobrotolitblye, at Moscow in 1793 and reprinted at Moscow in 1822. This was the translation carried by the pilgrim in The Way of a Pilgrims and indeed the impact of the Philokalia on Russian spirituality and culture in the nineteenth century was immense, as the writings of Dostoievsky, an assiduous reader of the book, alone sufficiently testify. A translation into Russian was made by Ignatii Brianchaninov (1807-1867) and was published in 1857. Yet another Russian translation, still with the title Dobrotolubiye, was made by Bishop Theophan the Recluse (1815-1894), who included in it several texts not in the original Greek edition, and deliberately omitted or paraphrased certain passages in some of the texts of the Greek edition. Bishop Theophan's translation was published at Moscow in five volumes at the expense of the Russian Monastery of St Panteleimon on Mount Athos. The first volume of the series, originally issued in 1877, was reprinted in 1883, 1885, 1905 and 1913. A photographic reprint of the 1883 edition was begun by the Monastery of the Holy Trinity, Jordanville, N.Y., in 1963. A Romanian translation, which also includes additional material, began to appear in 1946 under the editorship of Father Dumitru Staniloae; in 1976 the fifth volume of this edition appeared, and it is planned to complete it in eight volumes. A full French translation is in progress. Both the Romanian and the Flmch translations are based on the original Greek. The only previous translation into English of texts from the Philokalia is that made by E. Kadloubovsky and G. E. H. Palmer in two volumes with the titles <i>Writings from the Philokalia on Prayer of the Heart</i> and <i>Early Fathers from the Philokalia</i> published in 1951 and 1954 respectively. This translation was made, not from the Greek original, but from Theophan's Russian translation, and covers slightly less than a third of the material of the Greek edition. It was because of this that the translators wrote in their Introduction to the second of these two English volumes that 'the only final solution to the problem of making the treasures contained in the Philokalia available to the West in a form as rich and as wisely balanced as the original is for someone with the necessary qualities ... to undertake to translate the whole of the original Greek itself. We can only hope that this work will one day be achieved: it might well be one of the greatest single contributions to perpetuating in the West what is highest in the Christian tradition.' The present translation is a direct consequence of the hope expressed in that Introduction, written over twenty years ago.</p>
   <p> What first determined the choice of texts made by St Nikodmios and St Makarios, and gives them their cohesion? 'Philokalia' itself means love of the beautiful, the exalted, the excellent, understood as the transcendent source of life and the revelation of Truth. It is through such love that, as the subtitle of the original edition puts it, 'the intellect is purified, illumined and made perfect'. The texts were collected with a view to this purification, illumination and perfection. They show the way to awaken and develop attention and consciousness, to attain that state of watchfulness which is the hallmark of sanctity. They describe the conditions most effective for learning what their authors call the art of arts and the science of sciences, a learning which is not a matter of information or agility of mind but of a radical change of will and heart leading man towards the highest possibilities open to him, shaping and nourishing the unseen part of his being, and helping him to spiritual fulfillment and union with God. The Philokalia is an itinerary through the labyrinth of time, a silent way of love and gnosis through the deserts and emptinesses of life, especially of modem life, a vivifying and fadeless presence. It is an active force revealing a spiritual path and inducing man to follow it. It is a summons to him to overcome his ignorance, to uncover the knowledge that lies within, to rid himself of illusion, and to be receptive to the grace of the Holy Spirit who teaches all things and brings all things to remembrance. The texts of the Philokalia are, then, guides to the practice of the contemplative life. They constitute, as St Nikodnnos puts it in his introduction, 'a mystical school of inward prayer' where those who study may cultivate the divine seed implanted in their hearts at baptism and so grow in spirit that they become 'sons of God' (John 1:12), attaining through such deification 'the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ' (Eph. 4:13). The emphasis is therefore on inner work, on the cleansing of 'the inside of the cup and plate, so that their outside may also be clean' (Matt. 23:26). This does not mean that what one might call outer work - the keeping of the commandments and the practice of the moral virtues - is of no importance. On the contrary, such work is a pre-condition of that purification without which no real progress in inner work can be made. Indeed, in this respect outer and inner complement one another. Atrophy or defeat follow only when outer work is practiced as an end in itself, and the one thing needful -the inner practice of guarding the intellect and of pure prayer - is neglected. St Nikodimos himself remarks that such neglect is only too common: many there are who wear their whole life away in outer work, with the result that grace diminishes in them and they fail to realize the illumination of consciousness and purity of heart which are the goal of the spiritual path that the Philokaha charts for us.</p>
   <p> An advanced state which may be acquired through the pursuit of this path is described as hesychia, a word which not only bears the sense of tranquility and silence (hence our translation: stillness) but also is linked through its Greek root with the idea of being seated, fixed, and so of being concentrated. It is therefore fitting that from this word should come the term hesychasm, frequently applied to the whole complex of theory and practice which constitutes the path itself. But here a certain caution is needed. Some modem historians, prone to over-simplification and schematization, have tended to speak of hesychasm as though it were a phenomenon of the later Byzantine world. They speak of the hesychast movement, and by this they mean the spiritual revival which, centered on Mount Athos in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, spread from there into neighboring lands such as Bulgaria, Serbia and Russia. Yet hesychasm itself is far more than a local historical movement dating to the later Byzantine centuries. On the contrary it denotes the whole spiritual tradition going back to the earliest times and delineated in the Philokalia. If evidence for this is needed, it may be found in the fact that one of the central forms of the art and science which constitute hesychasm - namely, the invocation of the name of Jesus, or the Jesus Prayer, to give it its traditional title - is already integral to the spiritual method described in many of the texts included in this first volume, most if not all of which were written prior to the ninth century. Indeed, although the Philokalia is concerned with many other matters, it would not be too much to say that it is the recurrent references to the Jesus Prayer which more than anything else confer on it its inner unity.</p>
   <p> It must be stressed, however, that this spiritual path known as hesychasm cannot be followed in a vacuum. Although most of the texts in the Philokalia are not specifically doctrinal, they all presuppose doctrine even when they do not state it. Moreover, this doctrine entails an ecclesiology. It entails a particular understanding of the Church and a view of salvation inextricably bound up with its sacramental and liturgical life. This is to say that hesychasm is not something that has developed independently of or alongside the sacramental and liturgical life of the Church. It is part and parcel of it. It too is an ecclesial tradition. To attempt to practice it, therefore, apart from active participation in this sacramental and liturgical life is to cut it off from its living roots. It is also to abuse the intention of its exponents and teachers and so to act with a presumption that may well have consequences of a disastrous kind, mental and physical.</p>
   <p> There is a further point connected with this. The texts in the Philokalia were written by and for those actively living not only within the sacramental and liturgical framework of the Orthodox Church, but also within that of the Orthodox monastic tradition. They therefore presuppose conditions of life radically different from those in which most readers of this English translation are likely to find themselves. Is this tantamount to saying that the counsels they contam can be applied only within a monastic environment? Many hesychast writers affirm that this is not the case, and St Nikodimos himself, in his introduction to the original Philokalia, goes out of his way to stress that 'unceasing prayer' may or, rather, should be practiced by all. Naturally, the monastic life provides conditions, such as quietness, solitude and regularity, indispensable for that concentration without which one cannot advance far along the spiritual path. But, provided that the basic condition of active participation in the sacramental and liturgical life of the Church is fulfilled, then this path is open to all to follow, each to the best of his or her ability and whatever the circumstances under which he or she lives. Indeed, in this respect the distinction between the monastic life and life 'in the world' is but relative: every human being, by virtue of the fact that he or she is created in the image of God, is summoned to be perfect, is summoned to love God with all his or her heart, soul and mind. In this sense all have the same vocation and all must follow the same spiritual path. Some no doubt will follow it further than others: and again for some the intensity of the desire with which they pursue it may well lead them to embrace a pattern of life more in harmony with its demands, and this pattern may well be provided by the monastic life. But the path with its goal is one and the same whether followed within or outside a monastic environment. What is essential is that one does not follow it in an arbitrary and ignorant manner. Personal guidance from a qualified teacher should always be sought for. If such guidance is not to be found, then active participation in the sacramental and liturgical life of the Church, always necessary, will have an added importance in the overcoming of obstacles and dangers inherent in any quest of a spiritual nature. Certain key words occur and recur in these hesychastic writings. We have listed the most important of them in a glossary, specifying the English words we have used in translating them and the sense we attribute to them; and we have also indicated where they first occur in the translation itself. But their real significance will be grasped only as the reader penetrates ever more deeply into the meaning of the passages in which they are to be found - indeed, as he penetrates ever more deeply into the theory and practice of the spiritual path they help to signpost. Something similar applies with respect to the whole psychological understanding which these texts both presuppose and elucidate. In effect, one is confronted with a psychology, or science of the soul, many of whose fundamental features - particularly perhaps in relation to the role of the demons - are completely unrecognized by, not to say at odds with, the theories of most modem psychologists. The contemporary reader, influenced directly or indirectly by these latter-day theories, may well be tempted to reject hesychastic psychology outright. But alternatively he may be led first to question his own outlook and assumptions and then to modify or even abandon them in the light of the understanding with which he is now confronted. In any case, how he reacts will depend very largely on the degree to which he perceives the inner coherence and relevance of this understanding, not only on the theoretical level but also in terms of his own experience. In this connection it should be remembered that, however much the external appearances and conditions of the world may change, such changes can never uproot the fundamental potentialities of the human state and of man's relationship with God: and as it is with these latter that the teaching and method of the Philokalia are concerned, the counsels it enshrines are as valid and effective today as they were at the times at which they were written.</p>
   <p> This English translation of the Philokalia is produced under the auspices and with the financial assistance of a charitable trust, the Elmg Trust. The work of initial translation has been done by a group of scholars and collaborators, namely the Holy Transfiguration Monastery at Brookline, Massachusetts, Dr Constantine Cavamos of Boston, Father Basil Osbome of Oxford, and Father Norman Russell of the London Oratory. But the final version of the text has been prepared by and is the responsibility of the Editorial Committee set up by the Trustees of the Eling Trust, and consisting of G. E. H. Palmer, Dr Philip Sherrard and Archimandrite Kallistos Ware. The task of checking against the Greek text for consistency in interpretation in the English translation has been undertaken by the two last named members of this Committee, while all three have cooperated in establishing the definitive version of the translation itself. Although we have tried not to impose a uniformity of style, it is none the less inevitable that our translation should display less variety than the original texts. These texts were written by authors who lived at various times in a period that stretches over a thousand years and more, and who in addition came from many differing cultural backgrounds. Our translation extends over something like ten years, and all those who contributed to it share by and large in but a single culture. In spite of this we hope we have not suppressed entirely the distinctive flavor of the original texts. And we hope, too, that those who prepared the initial translations will forgive us for the many changes made to their texts for the reasons we have stated. The fact that we have made these changes in no way lessens our deep gratitude to them.</p>
   <p> We would like to thank Father Palamas Koumantos of Simonopetra Monastery on Mount Athos for his assistance; the Monks of the Serbian Monastery of Chilandan on Mount Athos for their generous hospitality on two prolonged occasions; Mrs. Ian Busby for her invaluable work; and Miss Marguerite Langford for her assistance.</p>
   <p> Finally, the Eling Trust and the Editorial Committee would also like to express their gratitude to the Ingram Merrill Foundation of New York for a substantial grant provided to support this translation.</p>

   <p> Inroductory Note</p>
   <p> There is some uncertainty about the identity of the author of the Twenty-Seven Texts that follow. According to St Nikodimos, St Isaiah the Solitary lived around the year 370 and was a contemporary Makarios the Great of Egypt. Most historians today consider him to be later in date. He is now usually identified with a monk who lived initially at Sketis in Egypt, and who then moved to Palestine at some date subsequent to 431, eventually dying in great old age as a recluse near Gaza on 11 August 491 (according to others, 489). Whichever date is preferred, it is evident that the author reflects the authentic spirituality of the Desert Fathers of Egypt and Palestine during the fourth and fifth centuries. St Nikodimos commends in particular his advice on the rebuttal of demonic provocations and on the need to be attentive to the conscience. St Nikodimos here gives no more than short extracts from a much longer work, as yet untranslated into English.^</p>

   <p> There is among the passions an anger of the inteUect, and this anger is in accordance with nature. Without anger a man cannot attain purity: he has to feel angry with all that is sown in him by the enemy. When Job felt this anger he reviled his enemies, calling them "dishonorable men of no repute, lacking everything good, whom I would not consider fit to live with the dogs that guard my flocks' (cf Job 30:1, 4. LXX). He who wishes to acquire the anger that is in accordance with nature must uproot all self-will, until he establishes within himself the state natural to the intellect.</p>
   <p> If you find yourself hating your fellow men and resist this hatred, and you see that it grows weak and withdraws, do not rejoice in your heart; for this withdrawal is a trick of the evil spirits. They are preparing a second attack worse than the first; they have left their troops behind the city and ordered them to remain there. If you go out to attack them, they will flee before you in weakness. But if your heart is then elated because you have driven them away, and you leave the city, some of them will attack you from the rear while the rest will stand their ground in front of you; and your wretched soul will be caught between them with no means of escape. The city is prayer. Resistance is rebuttal through Christ Jesus. The foundation is mcensive power.</p>
   <p> Let us stand firm in the fear of God, rigorously practicing the virtues and not giving our conscience cause to stumble. In the fear of God let us keep our attention fixed within ourselves, until our conscience achieves its freedom. Then there will be a union between it and us, and thereafter it will be our guardian, showing us each thing that we must uproot. But if we do not obey our</p>

   <p> conscience, it will abandon us and we shall fall into the hands of our enemies, who will never let us go. This is what our Lord taught us when He said: 'Come to an agreement with your adversary quickly while you are with him in the road, lest he hand you over to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer and you are cast into prison (Matt. 5:25). The conscience is called an 'adversary' because it opposes us when we wish to carry out the desires of our flesh; and if we do not listen to our conscience, it delivers us into the hands of our enemies.</p>
   <p> 4. If God sees that the intellect has entirely submitted to Him and puts its hope in Him alone. He strengthens it, saying: 'Have no fear Jacob my son, my little Israel" (Isa. 41:14. LXX), and: 'Have no fear: for I have delivered you, I have called you by My name; you are Mine. If you pass through water, I shall be with you, and the rivers will not drown you. If you go through fire, you will not be burnt, and the names will not consume you. For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, who saves you' (cf. Isa. 43:1-3. LXX).</p>
   <p> When the intellect hears these words of reassurance, it says boldly to its enemies: 'Who would fight with me? Let him stand against me. And who would accuse me? Let him draw near to me. Behold, the Lord is my helper; who will harm me? Behold, all of you are like an old moth-eaten garment' (cf Isa. 50:8-9. LXX).</p>
   <p> If your heart comes to feel a natural hatred for sin, it has defeated the causes of sin and freed itself from them. Keep hell's torments in mind: but know that your Helper is at hand. Do nothing that will grieve Him, but say to Him with tears: 'Be merciful and deliver me, 0 Lord, for without Thy help I cannot escape from the hands of my enemies." Be attentive to your heart, and He will guard you from all evil.</p>
   <p> The monk should shut all the gates of his soul, that is, the senses, so that he is not lured astray. When the intellect sees that it is not dominated by anything, it prepares itself for immortality, gathering its senses together and forming them into one body.</p>
   <p> If your intellect is freed from all hope in things visible, this is a sign that sin has died in you.</p>
   <p> If your intellect is freed, the breach between it and God is eliminated.</p>
   <p> [VI] 24</p>
   <p> St Isaiah the SoHtary</p>
   <p> On Guarding the Intellect</p>
   <p> Twenty-Seven Texts</p>
   <p> 10. If your intellect is freed from all its enemies and attains the Sabbath rest, it lives in another age, a new age in which it contemplates things new and undecaying. For 'wherever the dead body is, there will the eagles be gathered together' (Matt. 24: 28).</p>
   <p> 11. The demons cunningly withdraw for a time in the hope that we will cease to guard our heart, thinking we have now attained peace, then they suddenly attack our unhappy soul and seize it like a sparrow. Gaining possession of it, they drag it 7down mercilessly into all kinds of sin, worse than those which we have already committed and for which we have asked forgiveness. Let us stand, therefore, with fear of God and keep guard over our heart, practicing the virtues which check the wickedness of our enemies.</p>
   <p> 12. Our teacher Jesus Christ, out of pity for mankind and knowing the utter mercilessness of the demons, severely commands us: 'Be ready at every hour, for you do not know when the thief will come; do not let him come and find you asleep' (cf Matt. 24:42-43). He also says: "Take heed, lest your hearts be overwhelmed with debauchery and drunkenness and the cares of this life, and the hour come upon you unawares' (cf. Luke 21:34). Stand guard, then, over your heart and keep a watch on your senses; and if the remembrance of God dwells peaceably within you, you will catch the thieves when they try to deprive you of it. When a man has an exact knowledge about the nature of thoughts,* he recognizes those which are about to enter and defile him, troubling the intellect with distractions and making it lazy. Those who recognize these evil thoughts for what they are remain undisturbed and continue in prayer to God.</p>
   <p> God? It means that we have nothing extraneous in our inteUect when we are praying to Him: neither sensual pleasure as we bless Him, nor malice as we sing His praise, nor hatred as we exalt Him, nor jealousy to hinder us as we speak to Him and call Him to mind. For all these things are full of darkness; they are a wall imprisoning our wretched soul, and if the soul has them in itself it cannot worship God with purity. They obstruct its ascent and prevent it from meeting God: they hinder it from blessing Him inwardly and praying to Him with sweetness of heart, and so receiving His illumination. As a result the intellect is always shrouded in darkness and cannot</p>
   <p> [VI] 25</p>
   <p> St Isaiah the SoHtary</p>
   <p> On Guarding the Intellect</p>
   <p> Twenty-Seven Texts</p>
   <p> advance in holiness, because it does not make the effort to uproot these thoughts by means of spiritual knowledge.</p>
   <p> 14. When the intellect rescues the soul's senses from the desires of the flesh and imbues them with dispassion,* the passions shamelessly attack the soul, trying to hold its senses fast in sin; but if the intellect then continually calls upon God in secret. He, seeing all this, will send His help and destroy all the passions at once.</p>
   <p> 15. I entreat you not to leave your heart unguarded, so long as you are in the body. Just as a farmer cannot feel confident about the crop growing in his fields, because he does not know what will happen to it before it is stored away in his granary, so a man should not leave his heart unguarded so long as he still has breath in his nostrils. Up to his last breath he cannot know what passion will attack him; so long as he breathes, therefore, he must not leave his heart unguarded, but should at every moment pray to God for His help and mercy.</p>
   <p> 16. He who receives no help when, at war should feel no confidence when at peace.</p>
   <p> 17. When a man severs himself from evil, he gains an exact understanding of all the sins he has committed against God; for he does not see his sins unless he severs himself from them with a feeling of revulsion. Those who have reached this level pray to God with tears, and are filled with shame when they recall their evil love of the passions. Let us therefore pursue the spiritual way with all our strength, and God in His great mercy will help us. And if we have not guarded our hearts as our fathers guarded theirs, at least in obedience to God let us do all we can to keep our bodies sinless, trusting that at this time of spiritual dearth He will grant mercy to us together with His saints.</p>
   <p> 18.  Once you have begun to seek God with true devotion and with all your heart, then you cannot possibly imagine that you already conform to His will. So long as your conscience reproves you for anything that you have done contrary to nature, you are not yet free: the reproof means that you are still under trial and have not yet been acquitted. But if you find when you are praying that nothing at all accuses you of evil, then you are free and by God's will have entered into His peace.</p>
   <p> If you see growing within yourself a good crop, no longer choked by the tares of the evil one; if you find that the demons have</p>
   <p> St Isaiah the SoHtary On Guarding the Intellect Twenty-Seven Texts</p>
   <p> reluctantly withdrawn, convinced that it is no use making further attacks on your senses; if 'a cloud overshadows your tent (cf Exod. 40:34), and 'the sun does not bum you by day, nor the moon by night' (Ps. 121:6); if you find yourself equipped to pitch your tent and keep it as God wishes - if all this has happened, then you have gained the victory with God's help, and henceforward He will Himself overshadow your tent, for it is His.</p>
   <p> So long as the contest continues, a man is full of fear and trembling, wondering whether he will win today or be defeated, whether he will win tomorrow or be defeated: the struggle and stress constrict his heart. But when he has attained dispassion, the contest comes to an end; he receives the prize of victory and has no further anxiety about the three that were divided, for now through God they have made peace with one another. These three are the soul, the body and the spirit. When they become one through the energy of the Holy Spirit, they cannot again be separated. Do not think, then, that you have died to sin, so long as you suffer violence, whether waking or sleeping, at the hands of your opponents. For while a man is still competing in the arena, he cannot be sure of victory.</p>
   <p> 19.  When the intellect grows strong, it makes ready to pursue the love which quenches all bodily passions and which</p>
   <p> prevents anything contrary to nature from gaining control over the heart. Then the intellect, struggling against what is contrary to nature, separates this from what is in accordance with nature.</p>
   <p> 20. Examine yourself daily in the sight of God, and discover which of the passions is in your heart. Cast it out, and</p>
   <p> so escape His judgment.</p>
   <p> 21. Be attentive to your heart and watch your enemies, for they are cunning in their malice. In your heart be persuaded of this: it is impossible for a man to achieve good through evil means. That is why our Savior told us to be watchful, saying: 'Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there are that find it (Matt. 7:14).</p>
   <p> 22. Be attentive to yourself, so that nothing destructive can separate you from the love of God. Guard your heart,</p>
   <p> and do not grow listless and say: 'How shall I guard it, since I am a sinner?' For when a man abandons his sins and returns to God, his repentance regenerates him and renews him entirely.</p>
   <p> 23. Holy Scripture speaks everywhere about the guarding of the</p>
   <p> [VI] 27</p>
   <p> St Isaiah the Solitary On Guarding the Intellect Twenty-Seven Texts</p>
   <p> heart, in both the Old and the New Testaments. David says in the Psalms: '0 sons of men, how long will you be</p>
   <p> heavy of heart?' (Ps. 4:2. LXX), and again: 'Their heart is vain' (Ps. 5:9. LXX); and of those who think futile thoughts, he says: 'For he has said in his heart, I shall not be moved' (Ps. 10:6), and: 'He has said in his heart, God has forgotten'(Ps. 10:11).</p>
   <p> A monk should consider the purpose of each text in Scripture, to whom it speaks and on what occasions. He should persevere continually in the ascetic struggle and be on his guard against the provocations of the enemy. Like a pilot steering a boat through the waves, he should hold to his course, guided by grace. Keeping his attention fixed within himself, he should commune with God in stillness, guarding his thoughts from distraction and his intellect from curiosity.</p>
   <p> 24. In storms and squalls we need a pilot, and in this present life we need prayer: for we are susceptible to the provocations of our thoughts, both good and bad. If our thought is full of devotion and love of God, it rules over the passions. As hesychasts, we should discriminate between virtue and vice with discretion and watchfulness: and we should know which virtues to practice when in the presence of our brethren and elders and which to pursue when alone. We should know which virtue comes first, and which second or third; which passions attack the soul and which the body, and also which virtues concern the soul and which the body. We should know which virtue pride uses in order to assault the intellect, and which virtue leads to vainglory, wrath or gluttony. For we ought to purify our thoughts from 'all the self-esteem that exalts itself against the knowledge of God' (2 Cor. 10:5).</p>
   <p> 25. The first virtue is detachment, that is, death in relation to every person or thing. This produces the desire for God, and this in turn gives rise to the anger that is in accordance with nature, and that flares up against all the tricks of the enemy. Then the fear of God will establish itself within us, and through this fear love will be made manifest.</p>
   <p> 26. At the time of prayer, we should expel from our heart the provocation of each evil thought, rebutting it in a spirit</p>
   <p> of devotion so that we do not prove to be speaking to God with our lips, while pondering wicked thoughts in our heart. God will not accept from</p>

   <p> St Isaiah the SoHtary On Guarding the Intellect Twenty-Seven Texts</p>
   <p> the hesychast a prayer that is turbid and careless, for everywhere Scripture tells us to guard the soul's organs of perception. If a monk submits his will to the law of God, then his intellect will govern in accordance with this law all that is subordinate to itself. It will direct as it should all the soul's impulses, especially its mcensive power and desire, for these are subordinate to it.</p>
   <p> We have practiced virtue and done what is right, turning our desire towards God and His will, and directing our incensive power, or wrath, against the devil and sin. What then do we still lack'? Inward meditation.</p>
   <p> 27. If some shameful thought is sown in your heart as you are sitting in your cell, watch out. Resist the evil, so that it does not gain control over you. Make every effort to call God to mind, for He is looking at you, and whatever you are thinking in your heart is plainly visible to Him. Say to your soul: 'If you are afraid of sinners like yourself seeing your sins, how much more should you be afraid of God who notes everything?' As a result of this warning the fear of God will be revealed in your soul, and if you cleave to Him you will not be shaken by</p>
   <p> the passions: for it is written: 'They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion: he that dwells in Jerusalem shall never be shaken' (Ps. 125:1. LXX). Whatever you are doing, remember that God sees all your thoughts, and then you will never sin. To Him be glory through all the ages. Amen.</p>

   <p> Evagrios the Solitary</p>
   <p> (345/6 - 399) (I'olwne 1, pp. 29-71)</p>
   <p> Introductory Note</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary, also known as Evagrios Pontikos, was bom in 345 or 346, probably at Ibora in Pontus, although according to another opinion he was a native of Iberia (Georgia). A disciple of the Cappadocian Fathers, he was ordained reader by St Basil the Great and deacon by St Gregory the Theologian (Gregory of Nazianzos), and he accompanied the latter to the Council of Constantinople in 381 (the second Ecumenical Council). Evagrios was never ordained priest. After a brief stay in Jerusalem, he went in 383 to Egypt, where he spent the remaining sixteen years of his life. After two years at Nitria, where he became a monk, he moved to the more remote desert of Kellia, dying there in 399. While in Egypt he had as his spiritual father the priest of Kellia, St Makarios of Alexandria, and it is probable that he also knew St Makarios the Egyptian, the priest and spiritual father of Sketis. In the person of these two saints, he came into contact with the first generation of the Desert Fathers and with their spirituality in its purest form.</p>
   <p> In the numerous writings of Evagrios there may be discerned two tendencies, the one 'speculative' and the other 'practical'. On the 'speculative' side he relies heavily upon Origen (c. 185-c. 254), borrowing from him in particular certain theories about the pre-existence of human souls and the apokatastasis or final restoration of all things in Christ. These theories were condemned at the fifth Ecumenical Council (553). On the 'practical' side he draws upon the living experience of the Desert Fathers of Egypt, mainly Copts, among whom he spent the last years of his life. He possessed to an exceptional degree the gifts of psychological insight and vivid description, together with the ability to analyze and define with remarkable precision the various stages on the spiritual way. Here his teachings, so far from being condemned, have exercised a decisive influence upon subsequent writers. His disciple St John</p>

   <p> Evagrios the Solitary</p>
   <p> Introductory Note</p>
   <p> Cassian, while abandoning the suspect theories that Evagrios derived from Origen, transmitted the 'practical' aspect of Evagrios' teachings to the Latin West. In the Greek East the technical vocabulary devised by Evagrios</p>
   <p> remained thereafter standard: it can be found, for example, in the writings of St Diadochos of Photiki, St John Khmakos and St Maximos the Confessor, as also within the Syriac tradition, in the Mystic Treatises of St Isaac of Nineveh. The works included by St Nikodimos in the Philokalia all belong to the'practical' side of Evagrios, and contain little if any trace of suspect speculations.</p>
   <p> Several of Evagrios' works have come down under the name of other authors. This is the case with the writing On Prayer, which in the Greek Philokalia is ascribed to Neilos; but recent research has made it plain beyond any reasonable doubt that this is a writing of Evagrios.'</p>

   <p> Evagrios the Solitary Outline Teaching on Asceticism and Stillness in the Solitary Life</p>
   <p> In Jeremiah it is said: 'And you shall not take a wife in this place, for thus says the Lord concerning the sons and daughters bom in this place: . . . they shall die grievous deaths' (Jer. 16:1-4). This shows that, in the words of the Apostle, 'He that is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife', and he is inwardly divided, and 'she that is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband' (1 Cor. 7:32-34). It is clear that the statement in Jeremiah, 'they shall die grievous deaths', refers not only to the sons and daughters bom as a result of marriage, but also to those bom in the heart, that is, to worldly thoughts and desires: these too will die from the weak and sickly spirit of this world, and will have no place in heavenly life. On the other hand, as the Apostle says, 'he that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord' (1 Cor. 7:32); and he produces the fruits of eternal life, which always keep their freshness.</p>
   <p> Such is the solitary. He should therefore abstain from women and not beget a son or daughter in the place of which Jeremiah speaks. He must be a soldier of Christ, detached from material things, free from cares and not involved in any trade or commerce, for, as the Apostle says, 'In order to please the leader who has chosen him, the soldier going to war does not entangle himself in the affairs of this world' (2 Tim. 2:4). Let the monk follow this course, especially since he has renounced the materiality of this world in order to win the blessings of stillness. For the practice of stillness is full of joy and beauty: its yoke is easy and its burden light.</p>
   <p> Do you desire, then, to embrace this hfe of sohtude, and to seek out the blessings of stiUness? If so, abandon the cares of the world, and the principalities and powers that lie behind them: free yourself</p>
   <p> [VI] 32</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary Outline Teaching on Asceticism and Stillness in the Solitary Life</p>
   <p> from attachment to material things, from domination by passions and desires, so that as a stranger to all this you may attain true stillness. For only by raising himself above these things can a man achieve the life of stillness.</p>
   <p> Keep to a sparse and plain diet, not seeking a variety of tempting dishes. Should the thought come to you of getting extravagant foods in order to give hospitality, dismiss it, do not be deceived by it: for in it the enemy lies in ambush, waiting to tear you away from stillness. Remember how the Lord rebukes Martha (the soul that is over-busy with such things) when He says: 'You are anxious and troubled about many things: one thing alone is needful' (Luke 10:41-42) - to hear the divine word: after that, one should be content with anything that comes to hand. He indicates all this by adding: 'Mary has chosen what is best, and it cannot be taken away from her' (Luke 10:42). You also have the example of how the widow of Zarephath gave hospitality to the Prophet (cf 1 Kings 17:9-16). If you have only bread, salt or water, you can still meet the dues of hospitality. Even if you do not have these, but make the stranger welcome and say something helpful, you will not be failing in hospitality: for 'is not a word better than a gift?' (Eccles. 18:17). This is the view you should take of hospitality. Be careful, then, and do not desire wealth for giving to the poor. For this is another trick of the evil one, who often arouses self-esteem and fills your intellect with worry and restlessness. Think of the widow mentioned in the Gospel by our Lord: with two mites she surpassed the generous gifts of the wealthy. For He says: 'They cast into the treasury out of their abundance; but she . . . cast in all her livelihood' (Mark 12:44).</p>
   <p> With regard to clothes, be content with what is sufficient for the needs of the body. 'Cast your burden upon the Lord' (Ps. 55:22) and He will provide for you, since 'He cares for you' (IPet. 5:7). If you need food or clothes, do not be ashamed to accept what others offer you. To be ashamed to accept is a kind of pride. But if you have more than you require, give to those in need. It is in this way that God wishes His children to manage their affairs. That is why, writing to the Corinthians, the Apostle said about those who were in want:</p>
   <p> 'Your abundance should supply their want, so that their abundance likewise may supply your want: then there will be equality, as it is written: "He that gathered much had nothing over; and he that</p>
   <p> [VI] 33</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary Outline Teaching on Asceticism and Stillness in the Solitary Life</p>
   <p> gathered little had no lack'" (2 Cor. 8:14-15: Exod. 16:18). So if you have all you need for the moment, do not be anxious about the future, whether it is one day ahead or a week or months. For when tomorrow comes, it will supply</p>
   <p> what you need, if you seek above all else the kingdom of heaven and the righteousness of God: for the Lord says: 'Seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things as well will be given to you' (cf. Matt. 6:33).</p>
   <p> Do not have a servant, for if you do you will no longer have only yourself to provide for: and in that case the enemy may trip you up through the servant and disturb your mind with worries about laying in extravagant foods. Should you have the thought of getting a servant to allow your body a little ease, call to mind what is more important -1 mean spiritual peace, for spiritual peace is certainly more important than bodily ease. Even if you have the idea that taking a servant would be for the servant's benefit, do not accept it. For this is not our work: it is the work of others, of the holy Fathers who live in communities and not as solitaries. Think only of what is best for yourself, and safeguard the way of stillness.</p>
   <p> Do not develop a habit of associating with people who are materially minded and involved in worldly affairs. Live alone, or else with brethren who are detached from material things and of one mind with yourself. For if one associates with materially minded people involved in worldly affairs, one will certainly be affected by their way of life and will be subject to social pressures, to vain talk and every other kind of evil: anger, sorrow, passion for material things, fear of scandals. Do not get caught up in concern for your parents or affection for your relatives: on the contrary, avoid meeting them frequently, in case they rob you of the stillness you have in your cell and involve you in their own affairs. 'Let the dead bury their dead,' says the Lord: 'but come, follow me' (cf. Matt. 8:22).</p>
   <p> If you find yourself growing strongly attached to your cell, leave it, do not cling to it, be ruthless. Do everything possible to attain stillness and freedom from distraction, and struggle to live according to God's will, battling against invisible enemies. If you cannot attain stillness where you now live, consider living in exile, and try and make up your mind to go. Be like an astute business man: make stillness your criterion for testing the value of everything, and choose always what contributes to it.</p>
   <p> [VI] 34</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary Outline Teaching on Asceticism and Stillness in the Solitary Life</p>
   <p> Indeed, I urge you to welcome exile. It frees you from all the entanglements of your own locality, and allows you to enjoy the blessings of stillness undistracted. Do not stay in a town, but persevere in the wilderness. "Lo,' says the Psalm, 'then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness' (Ps. 55:7). If possible, do not visit a town at all. For you will find there nothing of benefit, nothing useful, nothing profitable for your way of life. To quote the Psalm again, 'I have seen violence and strife in the city' (Ps. 55:9). So seek out places that are free from distraction, and solitary. Do not be afraid of the noises you may hear. Even if you should see some demonic fantasy, do not be terrified or flee from the training ground so apt for your progress. Endure fearlessly, and you will see the great things of God, His help. His care, and all the other assurances of salvation. For as the Psalm says, 'I waited for Him who delivers me from distress of spirit and the tempest' (Ps. 55:8. LXX).</p>
   <p> Do not let restless desire overcome your resolution: for 'restlessness of desire perverts the guileless intellect' (Wisd. 4:12). Many temptations result from this. For fear that you may go wrong, stay rooted in your cell. If you have friends, avoid constant meetings with them. For if you meet only on rare occasions, you will be of more help to them. And if you find that harm comes through meeting them, do not see them at all. The friends that you do have</p>
   <p> should be of benefit to you and contribute to your way of life. Avoid associating with crafty or aggressive people, and do not live with anyone of that kind but shun their evil purposes; for they do not dwell close to God or abide with Him. Let your friends be men of peace, spiritual brethren, holy fathers. It is of such that the Lord speaks when he says: 'My mother and brethren and fathers are those who do the will of My Father who is in heaven' (cf Matt. 12:49-50). Do not pass your time with people engaged in worldly affairs or share their table, in case they involve you in their illusions and draw you away from the science of stillness. For this is what they want to do. Do not listen to their words or accept the thoughts of their hearts, for they are indeed harmful. Let the labor and longing of your heart be for the faithful of the earth, to become like them in mourning. For 'my eyes will be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me' (Ps. 101:6). If someone who lives in accordance with the love of God comes to you and invites you to eat, go if</p>
   <p> [VI] 35</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary Outline Teaching on Asceticism and Stillness in the Solitary Life</p>
   <p> you wish, but return quickly to your cell. If possible, never sleep outside your cell, so that the gift of stillness may always be with you. Then you will be unhindered on your chosen path.</p>
   <p> Do not hanker after fine foods and deceitful pleasures. For 'she that indulges in pleasure is dead while still alive', as the Apostle says (1 Tim. 5:6). Do not fill your belly with other people's food in case you develop a, longing for it, and this longing makes you want to eat at their table. For it is said: 'Do not be deceived by the filling of the belly' (Prov. 24:15. LXX). If you find yourself continually invited outside your cell, decline the invitations. For continual absence from your cell is harmful. It deprives you of the grace of stillness, darkens your mind, withers your longing for God. If a jar of wine is left in the same place for a long time, the wine in it becomes clear, settled and fragrant. But if it is moved about, the wine becomes turbid and dull, tainted throughout by the lees. So you, too, should stay in the same place and you will find how greatly this benefits you. Do not have relationships with too many people, lest your intellect becomes distracted and so disturbs the way of stillness.</p>
   <p> Provide yourself with such work for your hands as can be done, if possible, both during the day and at night, so that you are not a burden to anyone, and indeed can give to others, as Paul the Apostle advises (cf. 1 Thess. 2:9; Eph. 4:28). In this manner you will overcome the demon of listlessness and drive away all the desires suggested by the enemy; for the demon of listlessness takes advantage of idleness. 'Every idle man is full of desires' (Prov. 13:4. LXX).</p>
   <p> When buying or selling you can hardly avoid sin. So, in either case, be sure you lose a little in the transaction. Do not haggle about the price from love of gain, and so indulge in actions harmful to the soul - quarrelling, lying, shifting your ground and so on - thus bringing our way of life into disrepute. Understanding things in this manner, be on your guard when buying and selling. If possible it is best to place such business in the hands of someone you trust, so that, being thus relieved of the worry, you can pursue your calling with joy and hope.</p>
   <p> In addition to all that I have said so far, you should consider now other lessons which the way of stillness teaches, and do what I tell you. Sit in your cell, and concentrate your intellect; remember the day of death, visualize the dying of your body, reflect on this</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary Outline Teaching on Asceticism and Stillness in the Solitary Life</p>
   <p> calamity, experience the pain, reject the vanity of this world, its compromises and crazes, so that you may continue in the way of stillness and not weaken. Call to mind, also, what is even now going on in hell. Think of the suffering, the bitter silence, the terrible moaning, the great fear and agony, the dread of what is to come, the unceasing pain, the endless weeping. Remember, too, the day of your resurrection and how you will stand before God. Imagine that fearful and awesome judgment-seat. Picture all that awaits those who sin: their shame before God the Father and His Anointed, before angels, archangels, principalities and all mankind: think of all the forms of punishment: the eternal fire, the worm that does not die, the abyss of darkness, the gnashing of teeth, the terrors and the torments. Then picture all the blessings that await the righteous: intimate communion with God the Father and His Anointed, with angels, archangels, principalities and all the saints, the kingdom and its gifts, the gladness and the joy.</p>
   <p> Picture both these states: lament and weep for the sentence passed on sinners, mourn while you are doing this, frightened that you, too, may be among them. But rejoice and be glad at the blessings that await the righteous, and aspire to enjoy them and to be delivered from the torments of hell. See to it that you never forget these things, whether inside your cell or outside it. This will help you to escape thoughts that are defiling and harmful.</p>
   <p> Fast before the Lord according to your strength, for to do this will purge you of your iniquities and sins; it exalts the soul, sanctifies the mind, drives away the demons, and prepares you for God's presence. Having already eaten once, try not to eat a second time the same day, in case you become extravagant and disturb your mind. In this way you will have the means for helping others and for mortifying the passions of your body. But if there is a meeting of the brethren, and you have to eat a second and a third time, do not be disgruntled and surly. On the contrary, do gladly what you have to do, and when you have eaten a second or a third time, thank God that you have fulfilled the law of love and that He himself is providing for you. Also, there are occasions when, because of a bodily sickness, you have to eat a second and a third time or more often. Do not be sad about this; when you are ill you should modify your ascetic labors for the time being, so that you may regain the strength to take them up once more.</p>
   <p> [VI] 37</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary Outline Teaching on Asceticism and Stillness in the Solitary Life</p>
   <p> As far as abstinence from food is concerned, the divine Logos did not prohibit the eating of anything, but said: 'See, even as I have given you the green herb I have given you all things; eat, asking no questions; it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a man' (cf. Gen. 9:3; 1 Cor. 10:25; Matt. 15: 11). To abstain from food, then, should be a matter of our own choice and an ascetic labour.</p>
   <p> Gladly bear vigils, sleeping on the ground and all other hardships, looking to the glory that will be revealed to you and to all the saints; 'for the sufferings of this present time', says the Apostle, 'are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us' (Rom. 8 : 18).</p>
   <p> If you are disheartened, pray, as the Apostle says (cf. Jas. 5: 13). Pray with fear, trembling, effort, with inner</p>
   <p> watchfulness and vigilance. To pray in this manner is especially necessary because the enemies are so malignant. For it is just when they see us at prayer that they come and stand beside us, ready to attack, suggesting to our intellect the very things we should not think about when praying; in this way they try to take our intellect captive and to make our prayer and supplication vain and useless. For prayer is truly vain and useless when not performed with fear and trembling, with inner watchfulness and vigilance. When someone approaches an earthly king, he entreats him with fear, trembling and attention: so much the more, then, should we stand and pray in this manner before God the Father, the Master of all, and before Christ the King of Kings. For it is He whom the whole spiritual host and the choir of angels serve with fear and glorify with trembling; and they sing in unceasing praise to Him, together with the Father who has no origin, and with the all-holy and coetemal Spirit, now and ever through all the ages. Amen.</p>
   <p> [VI] 38</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary Texts on Discrimination in Respect of Passions and Thoughts</p>
   <p> 1. Of the demons opposing us in the practice of the ascetic life, there are three groups who fight in the front line:</p>
   <p> those entrusted with the appetites of gluttony, those who suggest avaricious thoughts, and those who incite us to seek the esteem of men. All the other demons follow behind and in their turn attack those already wounded by the first three groups. For one does not fall into the power of the demon of unchastity, unless one has first fallen because of gluttony: nor is one's anger aroused unless one is fighting for food or material possessions or the esteem of men. And one does not escape the demon of dejection, unless one no longer experiences suffering when deprived of these things. Nor will one escape pride, the first offspring of the devil, unless one has banished avarice, the root of all evil, since poverty makes a man humble, according to Solomon (cf. Prov. 10:4. LXX). In short, no one can fall into the power of any demon, unless he has been wounded by those of the front line. That is why the devil suggested these three thoughts to the Savior: first he exhorted Him to turn stones into bread; then he promised Him the whole world, if Christ would fall down and worship him: and thirdly he said that, if our Lord would listen to him. He would be glorified and suffer nothing in falling from the pinnacle of the temple. But our Lord, having shown Himself superior to these temptations, commanded the devil to 'get behind Him'. In this way He teaches us that it is not possible to drive away the devil, unless we scornfully reject these three thoughts (cf Matt. 4:1-10).</p>
   <p> 2. All thoughts inspired by the demons produce within us conceptions of sensory objects; and in this way the</p>
   <p> intellect, with such conceptions imprinted on it, bears the forms of these objects within itself. So, by recognizing the object presented to it, the</p>
   <p> [VI] 39</p>
   <p> Evagrios the SoHtary Texts on Discrimination in Respect of Passions and Thoughts</p>
   <p> intellect knows which demon is approaching. For example, if the face of a person who has done me harm or insulted me appears in my mind, I recognize the demon of rancor approaching. If there is a suggestion of material things or of esteem, again it will be clear which demon is troubling me. In the same way with other thoughts, we can infer from the object appearing in the mind which demon is close at hand, suggesting that object to us. I do not say that all</p>
   <p> thoughts of such things come from the demons; for when the intellect is activated by man it is its nature to bring forth the images of past events. But all thoughts producing anger or desire in a way that is contrary to nature are caused by demons. For through demonic agitation the intellect mentally commits adultery and becomes incensed. Thus it cannot receive the vision of God, who sets us in order: for the divine splendor only appears to the intellect during prayer, when the intellect is free from conceptions of sensory objects.</p>
   <p> 3.  Man cannot drive away impassioned thoughts unless he watches over his desire and incensive power. He destroys desire through fasting, vigils and sleeping on the ground, and he tames his incensive power through long-suffering, forbearance, forgiveness and acts of compassion. For with these two passions are connected almost all the demonic thoughts which lead the intellect to disaster and perdition. It is impossible to overcome these passions unless we can rise above attachment to food and possessions, to self-esteem and even to our very body, because it is through the body that the demons often attempt to attack us. It is essential, then, to imitate people who are in danger at sea and throw things overboard because of the violence of the winds and the threatening waves. But here we must be very careful in case we cast things overboard just to be seen doing so by men. For then we shall get the reward we want; but we shall suffer another shipwreck, worse than the first, blown off our course by the contrary wind of the demon of self-esteem. That is why our Lord, instructing the intellect, our helmsman, says in the Gospels: 'Take heed that you do not give alms in front of others, to be seen by them; for unless you take heed, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.' Again, He says: 'When you pray, you must not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in synagogues and at street-comers, so as to be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they get the reward they want. . . . Moreover when you fast, do not put on a gloomy face, like the hypocrites:</p>
   <p> [VI] 40</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary Texts on Discrimination in Respect of Passions and Thoughts</p>
   <p> for they disfigure their faces, so that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, they get the reward they want' (cf. Matt. 6: 1-18). Observe how the Physician of souls here corrects our incensive power through acts of compassion, purifies the intellect through prayer, and through fasting withers desire. By means of these virtues the new Adam is formed, made again according to the image of his Creator - an Adam in whom, thanks to dispassion, there is 'neither male nor female' and, thanks to singleness of faith, there is 'neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free; but Christ is all, and in all' (Gal. 3:28; Col. 3: 10:11).</p>
   <p> 4. We shall now enquire how, in the fantasies that occur during sleep, the demons imprint shapes and forms on our</p>
   <p> intellect. Normally the intellect receives these shapes and forms either through the eyes when it is seeing, or through the ears when it is hearing, or through some other sense, or else through the memory, which stirs up and imprints on the intellect things which it has experienced through the body. Now it seems to me that in our sleep, when the activity of our bodily senses is suspended, it is by arousing the memory that the demons make this imprint. But, in that case, how do the demons arouse the memory? Is it through the passions? Clearly this is so, for those in a state of purity and dispassion no longer experience demonic fantasies in sleep. There is also an activity of the memory that is not demonic: it is caused by ourselves or by the angelic powers, and through it we may meet with saints and delight in their company. We should notice in addition that during sleep the memory</p>
   <p> stirs up, without the body's participation, those very images which the soul has received in association with the body. This is clear from the fact that we often experience such images during sleep, when the body is at rest.</p>
   <p> Just as it is possible to think of water both while thirsty and while not thirsty, so it is possible to think of gold with greed and without greed. The same applies to other things. Thus if we can discriminate in this way between one kind of fantasy and another, we can then recognize the artfulness of the demons. We should be aware, too, that the demons also use external things to produce fantasies, such as the sound of waves heard at sea. 5. When our incensive power is aroused in a way contrary to nature, it greatly furthers the aim of the demons and is an ally in all</p>
   <p> [VI] 41</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary Texts on Discrimination in Respect of Passions and Thoughts</p>
   <p> their evil designs. Day and night, therefore, they are always trying to provoke it. And when they see it tethered by gentleness, they at once try to set it free on some seemingly just pretext; in this way, when it is violently aroused, they can use it for their shameful purposes. So it must not be aroused either for just or for unjust reasons; and we must not hand a dangerous sword to those too readily incensed to wrath, for it often happens that people become excessively worked up for quite trivial reasons. Tell me, why do you rush into battle so quickly, if you are really above caring about food, possessions and glory? Why keep a watchdog if you have renounced everything? If you do, and it barks and attacks other men, it is clear that there are still some possessions for it to guard. But since I know that wrath is destructive of pure prayer, the fact that you cannot control it shows how far you are from such prayer. I am also surprised that you have forgotten the saints: David who exclaims, 'Cease from anger, and put aside your wrath' (Ps. 37:8. LXX); and Ecclesiastes who urges us, 'Remove wrath from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh' (Eccles. 11:10. LXX); while the Apostle commands that always and everywhere men should 'lift up holy hands, without anger and without quarrelling" (1 Tim. 2:8). And do we not leam the same from the mysterious and ancient custom of putting dogs out of the house during prayer? This indicates that there should be no wrath in those who pray. 'Their wine is the wrath of serpents' (Deut. 32:33. LXX); that is why the Nazarenes abstained from wine.</p>
   <p> It is needless to insist that we should not worry about clothes or food. The Savior Himself forbids this in the Gospels: 'Do not worry about what to eat or drink, or about what to wear' (cf Matt. 6:25). Such anxiety is a mark of the Gentiles and unbelievers, who reject the providence of the Lord and deny the Creator. An attitude of this kind is entirely wrong for Christians who believe that even two sparrows which are sold for a farthing are under the care of the holy angels (cf. Matt. 10: 29). The demons, however, after arousing impure thoughts, go on to suggest worries of this kind, so that 'Jesus conveys Himself away', because of the multitude of concerns in our mind (cf. John 5:13). The divine word can bear no fruit, being choked by our cares. Let us, then, renounce these cares, and throw them down before the Lord, being content with what we have at the moment; and living in poverty and rags, let us day by</p>
   <p> [VI] 42</p>
   <p> Evagrios the SoHtary Texts on Discrimination in Respect of Passions and Thoughts</p>
   <p> day rid ourselves of all that fills us with self-esteem. If anyone thinks it shameful to live in rags, he should remember St Paul, who 'in cold and nakedness' patiently awaited the 'crown of righteousness' (2 Cor. 11:27; 2 Tim. 4:8). The</p>
   <p> Apostle likened this world to a contest in an arena (cf. 1 Cor. 9:24); how then can someone clothed with anxious thoughts run for 'the prize of the high calling of God' (Phil. 3:14), or 'wrestle against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world' (Eph. 6:12)? I do not see how this is possible: for just as a runner is obstructed and weighed down by clothing, so too is the intellect by anxious thoughts - if indeed the saying is true that the intellect is attached to its own treasure; for it is said, 'where your treasure is, there will your heart be also' (Matt. 6:21).</p>
   <p> 6.  Sometimes thoughts are cut off, and sometimes they do the cutting off. Evil thoughts cut off good thoughts, and in</p>
   <p> turn are cut off by good thoughts. The Holy Spirit therefore notes to which thought we give priority and condemns or approves us accordingly. What I mean is something like this: the thought occurs to me to give hospitality and it is for the Lord's sake; but when the tempter attacks, this thought is cut off and in its place he suggests giving hospitality for the sake of display. Again, the thought comes to me of giving hospitality so as to appear hospitable in the eyes of others. But this thought in its turn is cut off when a better thought comes, which leads me to practice this virtue for the Lord's sake and not so as to gain esteem from men.</p>
   <p> 7. We have learnt, after much observation, to recognize the difference between angelic thoughts, human thoughts,</p>
   <p> and thoughts that come from demons. Angelic thought is concerned with the true nature of things and with searching out their spiritual essences. For example, why was gold created and scattered like sand in the lower regions of the earth, to be found only with much toil and effort? And how, when found, is it washed in water and committed to the fire, and then put into the hands of craftsmen who fashion it into the candlestick of the tabernacle and the censers and the vessels (cf. Exod. 25:22-39) from which, by the grace of our Savior, the king of Babylon no longer drinks (cf. Dan. 5:2, 3)? A man such as Cleopas brings a heart bummg with these mysteries (cf. Luke 24:32). Demonic thought, on the other hand, neither knows nor can</p>
   <p> [VI] 43</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary Texts on Discrimination in Respect of Passions and Thoughts</p>
   <p> know such things. It can only shamelessly suggest the acquisition of physical gold, looking forward to the wealth and glory that will come from this. Finally, human thought neither seeks to acquire gold nor is concerned to know what it symbolizes, but brings before the mind simply the image of gold, without passion or greed. The same principle applies to other things as well.</p>
   <p> 8. There is a demon, known as the deluder, who visits the brethren especially at dawn, and leads the intellect about</p>
   <p> from city to city, from village to village, from house to house, pretending that no passions are aroused through</p>
   <p> such visits; but then the intellect goes on to meet and talk with old acquaintances at greater length, and so</p>
   <p> allows its own state to be corrupted by those it encounters. Little by little it falls away from the knowledge of</p>
   <p> God and holiness, and forgets its calling. Therefore the solitary must watch this demon, noting where he comes</p>
   <p> from and where he ends up; for this demon does not make this long circuit without purpose and at random, but</p>
   <p> because he wishes to corrupt the state of the solitary, so that his intellect, over-excited by all this wandering, and</p>
   <p> intoxicated by its many meetings, may immediately fall prey to the demons of unchastity, anger or dejection -</p>
   <p> the demons that above all others destroy its inherent brightness.</p>
   <p> But if we really want to understand the cunning of this demon, we should not be hasty in speaking to him, or tell</p>
   <p> others what is taking place, how he is compelling us to make these visits in our mind and how he is gradually</p>
   <p> driving the intellect to its death - for then he will flee from us, as he cannot bear to be seen doing this; and so we</p>
   <p> shall not grasp any of the things we are anxious to learn. But, instead, we should allow him one more day, or even</p>
   <p> two, to play out his role, so that we can learn about his deceitfulness in detail; then, mentally rebuking him, we put</p>
   <p> him to flight. But because during temptation the intellect is clouded and does not see exactly what is happening, do</p>
   <p> as follows after the demon has withdrawn. Sit down and recall in solitude the things that have happened: where you started and where you went, in what place you were seized by the spirit of unchastity, dejection or anger and how it all happened. Examine these things closely and commit them to memory, so that you will then be ready to expose the demon when he next approaches you. Try to become conscious of the weak spot</p>
   <p> [VI] 44</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary Texts on Discrimination in Respect of Passions and Thoughts</p>
   <p> in yourself which he hid from you, and you will not follow him again. If you wish to enrage him, expose him at once when he reappears, and tell him just where you went first, and where next, and so on. For he becomes very angry and cannot bear the disgrace. And the proof that you spoke to him effectively is that the thoughts he suggested leave you. For he cannot remain in action when he is openly exposed.</p>
   <p> The defeat of this demon is followed by heavy sleepiness and deadness, together with a feeling of great coldness in the eyelids, countless yawnings, and heaviness in the shoulders. But if you pray intensely all this is dispersed by the Holy Spirit.</p>
   <p> 9. Hatred against the demons contributes greatly to our salvation and helps our growth in holiness. But we do not of</p>
   <p> ourselves have the power to nourish this hatred into a strong plant, because the pleasure-loving spirits restrict it and encourage the soul again to indulge in its old habitual loves. But this indulgence - or rather this gangrene that is so hard to cure - the Physician of souls heals by abandoning us. For He permits us to undergo some fearful suffering night and day, and then the soul returns again to its original hatred, and learns like David to say to the Lord: T hate them with perfect hatred: I count them my enemies' (Ps. 139: 22). For a man hates his enemies with perfect hatred when he sins neither in act nor in thought - which is a sign of complete dispassion.</p>
   <p> 10. Now what am I to say about the demon who makes the soul obtuse? For I am afraid to write about him: how, at</p>
   <p> his approach, the soul departs from its own proper state and strips itself of reverence and the fear of God, no longer regarding sin as sin, or wickedness as wickedness; it looks on judgment and the eternal punishment of hell as mere words: it laughs at the fire which causes the earth to tremble; and, while supposedly confessing God, it has no understanding of His commandments. You may beat your breast as such a soul draws near to sin, but it takes no notice. You recite from the Scripture, yet it is wholly indifferent and will not hear. You point out its shame and disgrace among men, and it ignores you, like a pig that closes its eyes and charges through a fence. This demon gets into the soul by way of long-continuing thoughts of self-esteem; and unless 'those days are shortened, no flesh will be saved' (Matt. 24:22).</p>
   <p> This is one of those demons that seldom approach brethren living [VI] 45</p>
   <p> Evagrios the SoHtary Texts on Discrimination in Respect of Passions and Thoughts</p>
   <p> in a community. The reason is clear: when people round us fall into misfortune, or are afflicted by illness, or are suffering in prison, or meet sudden death, this demon is driven out; for the soul has only to experience even a little compunction or compassion and the callousness caused by the demon is dissolved. We solitaries lack these things, because we live in the wilderness and sickness is rare among us. It was to banish this demon especially that the Lord</p>
   <p> enjoined us in the Gospels to call on the sick and visit those in prison. For 'I was sick,' He says, 'and you visited Me' (Matt. 25:36).</p>
   <p> But you should know this: if an anchorite falls in with this demon, yet does not admit unchaste thoughts or leave his cell out of listlessness, this means he has received the patience and self-restraint that come from heaven, and is blessed with dispassion. Those, on the other hand, who profess to practice godliness, yet choose to have dealings with people of the world, should be on their guard against this demon. I feel ashamed to say or write more about him.</p>
   <p> 1 L All the demons teach the soul to love pleasure: only the demon of dejection refrains from doing this, since he corrupts the thoughts of those he enters by cutting off every pleasure of the soul and drying it up through dejection, for 'the bones of the dejected are dried up' (Prov. 17:22. LXX). Now if this demon attacks only to a moderate degree, he makes the anchorite more resolute; for he encourages him to seek nothing worldly and to shun all pleasures. But when the demon remains for longer, he encourages the soul to give up, or forces it to run away. Even Job was tormented by this demon, and it was because of this that he said: '0 that I might lay hands upon myself, or at least ask someone else to do this for me' (Job 30:24. LXX).</p>
   <p> The symbol of this demon is the viper. When used in moderation for man's good, its poison is an antidote against that of other venomous creatures, but when taken in excess it kills whoever takes it. It was to this demon that Paul delivered the man at Corinth who had fallen into sin. That is why he quickly wrote again to the Corinthians saying: 'Confirm your love towards him . . . lest perhaps he should be swallowed up with too great dejection' (2 Cor. 2:7-8). He knew that this spirit, in troubling men, can also bring about true repentance. It was for this reason that St John the Baptist gave the name 'progeny of vipers' to those who were goaded by this spirit to seek refuge in God, saying: 'Who has warned you to flee</p>
   <p> [VI] 46</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary Texts on Discrimination in Respect of Passions and Thoughts</p>
   <p> from the anger to come? Bring forth fruits, then, that testify to your repentance; and do not think that you can just say within yourselves. We have Abraham as our father' (Matt. 3:7-9). But if a man imitates Abraham and leaves his country and kindred (cf Gen. 12:1), he thereby becomes stronger than this demon.</p>
   <p> 12. He who has mastery over his incensive power has mastery also over the demons. But anyone who is a slave to it</p>
   <p> is a stranger to the monastic life and to the ways of our Savior, for as David said of the Lord: 'He will teach the gentle His ways' (Ps. 25:9). The intellect of the solitary is hard for the demon to catch, for it shelters in the land of gentleness. There is scarcely any other virtue which the demons fear as much as gentleness. Moses possessed this virtue, for he was called 'very gentle, above all men' (Num. 12:3). And David showed that it makes men worthy to be remembered by God when he said: 'Lord, remember David and all his gentleness' (Ps. 132:1. LXX). And the Savior Himself also enjoined us to imitate Him in His gentleness, saying: 'Learn from Me; for I am gentle and humble in heart: and you will find rest for your souls' (Matt. 11:29). Now if a man abstains from food and drink, but becomes incensed to wrath because of evil thoughts, he is like a ship sailing the open sea with a demon for pilot. So we must keep this watchdog under careful control, training him to destroy only the wolves and not to devour the sheep, and to show the greatest gentleness towards all men.</p>
   <p> 13. In the whole range of evil thoughts, none is richer in resources than self-esteem; for it is to be found almost everywhere, and like some cunning traitor in a city it opens the gates to all the demons. So it greatly debases the intellect of the solitary, filling it with many words and notions, and polluting the prayers through which he is</p>
   <p> trying to heal all the wounds of his soul. All the other demons, when defeated, combine to increase the strength of this evil thought: and through the gateway of self-esteem they all gain entry into the soul, thus making a man's last state worse than his first (cf Matt. 12:45). Self-esteem gives rise in turn to pride, which cast down from heaven to earth the highest of the angels, the seal of God's likeness and the crown of all beauty. So turn quickly away from pride and do not dally with it, in case you surrender your life to others and your substance to the merciless (cf. Prov. 5:9 demon is driven away by intense prayer and by not doing or</p>
   <p> [VI] 47</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary Texts on Discrimination in Respect of Passions and Thoughts</p>
   <p> saying anything that contributes to the sense of your own importance.</p>
   <p> 14. When the intellect of the solitary attains some small degree of dispassion, it mounts the horse of self-esteem and</p>
   <p> immediately rides off into cities, taking its fill of the lavish praise accorded to its repute. But by God's providence the spirit of unchastity now confronts it and shuts it up in a sty of dissipation. This is to teach it to stay in bed until it is completely recovered and not to act like disobedient patients who, before they are fully cured of their disease, start taking walks and baths and so fall sick again. Let us sit still and keep our attention fixed within ourselves, so that we advance in holiness and resist vice more strongly. Awakened in this way to spiritual knowledge, we shall acquire contemplative insight into many things: and ascending still higher, we shall receive a clearer vision of the light of our Savior.</p>
   <p> 15. I cannot write about all the villainies of the demons: and I feel ashamed to speak about them at length and in detail, for fear of harming the more simple-minded among my readers. But let me tell you about the cunning of the demon of unchastity. When a man has acquired dispassion in the appetitive part of his soul and shameful thoughts cool down within him, this demon at once suggests images of men and women playing with one another, and makes the solitary a spectator of shameful acts and gestures. But this temptation need not be permanent: for intense prayer, a very frugal diet, together with vigils and the development of spiritual contemplation, drive it away like a light cloud. There are times when this cunning demon even touches the flesh, inflaming it to uncontrolled desire: and it devises endless other tricks which need not be described.</p>
   <p> Our incensive power is also a good defense against this demon. When it is directed against evil thoughts of this kind, such power fills the demon with fear and destroys his designs. And this is the meaning of the statement: 'Be angry, and do not sin' (Ps. 4:4). Such anger is a useful medicine for the soul at times of temptation.</p>
   <p> The demon of anger employs tactics resembling those of the demon of unchastity. For he suggests images of our parents, friends or kinsmen being gratuitously insulted: and in this way he excites our incensive power, making us say or do something vicious to those who appear in our minds. We must be on our guard against these fantasies and expel them quickly from our mind, for if we</p>
   <p> [VI] 48</p>
   <p> Evagrios the SoHtary</p>
   <p> Texts on Discrimination in Respect of Passions and Thoughts</p>
   <p> dally with them, they will prove a blazing firebrand to us during prayer. People prone to anger are especially liable to fall into these temptations; and if they do, then they are far from pure prayer and from the knowledge of our Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
   <p> 16. As sheep to a good shepherd, the Lord has given to man intellections of this present world: for it is written: 'He</p>
   <p> has given intellection to the heart of every man' (cf. Heb. 10:16). To help man He has given him mcensive power and desire, so that with the first he may drive away wolflike intellections, while with the second he may lovingly tend the sheep, even though he is often exposed to rains and winds. In addition, God has given man the law, so that he may shepherd the sheep; He has given him green pastures and refreshing water (cf. Ps. 23:2), a psaltery and harp, a rod and staff. In this way he gathers hay from the mountains, and is fed and clothed from his Hock; for it is written, 'Does anyone feed a Hock and not drink its milk?' (1 Cor. 9:7). Therefore the solitary ought to guard this Hock night and day, making sure that none of the lambs is caught by wild beasts or falls into the hands of thieves. Should this happen in some valley, he must at once snatch the creature from the mouth of the lion or the bear (cf. 1 Sam. 17:35).</p>
   <p> What does it mean for the lambs to be caught by wild beasts? It means that when we think about our brother we feed on hatred; when we think about a woman we are moved with shameful lust; when we think about gold and silver we are filled with greed: and likewise when we think about gifts received from God, our mind is gorged with self-esteem. The same happens in the case of other intellections if they are seized by the passions.</p>
   <p> We must not only guard this flock by day, but also keep watch at night: for by having fantasies of shameful and evil things we may lose some of the sheep entrusted to us. And this is the meaning of Jacob's words: 'I did not bring you a sheep which was caught by wild beasts: I made good of myself the thefts of the day and the thefts of the night. I was parched with heat by day, and chilled with frost by night, and sleep departed from my eyes'(Gen. 31:39-40. LXX).</p>
   <p> If a certain listlessness overtakes us as a result of our efforts, we should climb a little up the rock of spiritual knowledge and play on the harp, plucking the strings with the skills of such knowledge. Let us pasture our sheep below Mount Sinai, so that the God of our</p>
   <p> [VI] 49</p>
   <p> Evagrios the SoHtary Texts on Discrimination in Respect of Passions and Thoughts</p>
   <p> fathers may speak to us, too, out of the bush (cf. Exod. 3) and show us the inner essence of signs and wonders.</p>
   <p> 17. Our spiritual nature, which had become dead through wickedness, is raised once more by Christ through the contemplation of all the ages of creation. And through the spiritual knowledge that He gives of Himself, the Father raises the soul which has died the death of Christ. And this is the meaning of Paul's statement: 'If we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him' (cf. 2 Tim. 2:11).</p>
   <p> 18. When the intellect has shed its fallen state and acquired the state of grace, then during prayer it will see its own nature like a sapphire or the color of heaven. In Scripture this is called the realm of God that was seen by the elders on Mount Sinai (cf. Exod. 24:10).</p>
   <p> 19.  Of the unclean demons, some tempt man in so far as he is man, while others disturb him in so far as he is a non-rational animal. The first, when they approach us, suggest to us notions of self-esteem, pride, envy or censoriousness, notions by which non-rational animals are not affected; whereas the second, when they approach, arouse incensive power and desire in a manner contrary to nature. For these passions are common to us and to animals, and lie concealed beneath our rational and spiritual nature. Hence the Holy Spirit says of the thoughts that come to men in so far as they are men: 'I have said, you are gods, and all of you are children of the most High. But you shall die as men, and fall as one of the princes' (Ps. 82:6-7). But what does He say of the thoughts which stir in men non-rationally? 'Do not be as the horse and mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be controlled with bit and bridle in case they attack you' (Ps. 32:9). Now if 'the soul that sins shall die' (Ezek. 18:4), it is clear that in so far as we die as men we are buried by men, but in so far as we are slain or fall as non-rational animals, we are devoured by vultures and ravens whose young 'cry' to the Lord (Ps. 147:9) and 'roU themselves in blood' (Job 39:30. LXX). 'He that has ears to hear, let him hear' (Matt. 11:15).</p>
   <p> 20.  When one of the enemy approaches you and wounds you, and you wish to turn his sword back into his own heart</p>
   <p> (cf. Ps. 37:37:15), then do as follows: analyze in yourself the sinful thought that has wounded you, what it is, what it consists of, and what in it</p>
   <p> [VI] 50</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary Texts on Discrimination in Respect of Passions and Thoughts</p>
   <p> especially afflicts the intellect. Suppose, for instance, that a thought full of avarice is suggested to you. Distinguish between the component elements: the intellect which has accepted the thought, the intellection of gold, gold itself, and the passion of avarice. Then ask: in which of these does the sin consist? Is it the intellect? But how then can the intellect be the image of God? Is it the intellection of gold? But what sensible person would ever say that? Then is gold itself the sin? In that case, why was it created? It follows, then, that the cause of the sin is the fourth element, which is neither an objective reality, nor the intellection of something real, but is a certain noxious pleasure which, once it is freely chosen, compels the intellect to misuse what God has created. It is this pleasure that the law of God commands us to cut off Now as you investigate the thought in this way and analyze it into its components, it will be destroyed; and the demon will take to flight once your mind is raised to a higher level by this spiritual knowledge.</p>
   <p> But before using his own sword against him, you may choose first to use your sling against him. Then take a stone from your shepherd's bag and sling it (cf 1 Sam. 17) by asking these questions: how is it that angels and demons affect our world whereas we do not affect their worlds, for we cannot bring the angels closer to God, and we cannot make the demons more impure? And how was Lucifer, the morning star, cast down to the earth (cf. Isa. 14:12), 'making the deep boil like a brazen cauldron' (Job 41:31. LXX), disturbing all by his wickedness and seeking to rule over all? Insight into these things grievously wounds the demon and puts all his troops to flight. But this is possible only for those who have been in some measure purified and gained a certain vision of the inner essences of created things; whereas the impure have no insight into these essences, and even if they have been taught by others how to outwit the enemy they will fail because of the great clouds of dust and the turmoil aroused by their passions at the time of battle. For the enemy's troops must be made quiet, so that Goliath alone can face our David. In combat with all unclean thoughts, then, let us use these two methods: analysis of the thought attacking us, and the asking of questions about inner essences.</p>

   <p> idea of bread persists in a hungry man because of his hunger, and the idea of water in a thirsty man because of his thirst, so ideas of material things and of the shameful thoughts that follow a surfeit of food and drink persist in us because of the passions. The same is true about thoughts of self-esteem and other ideas. It is not possible for an intellect choked by such ideas to appear before God and receive the crown of righteousness. It is through being dragged down by such thoughts that the wretched intellect, like the man in the Gospels, declines the invitation to the supper of the knowledge of God (cf. Luke 14:18); and the man who was bound hand and foot and cast into outer darkness (cf. Matt. 22:13) was clothed in a garment woven of these thoughts, and so was judged by the Lord, who had invited him, not to be worthy of the wedding feast. For the true wedding garment is the dispassion of the deiform soul which has renounced worldly desires.</p>
   <p> In the texts On Prayer it is explained why dwelhng on ideas of sensory objects destroys true knowledge of God.</p>
   <p> 23. As we stated at the beginning, there are three chief groups of demons opposing us in the practice of the ascetic life, and after them follows the whole army of the enemy. These three groups fight in the front line, and with impure thoughts seduce our souls into wrongdoing. They are the demons set over the appetites of gluttony, those who suggest to us avaricious thoughts, and those who incite US to seek esteem in the eyes of men. If you long for pure prayer, keep guard over your incensive power; and if you desire self-restraint, control your belly, and do not take your fill even of bread and water. Be vigilant in prayer and avoid all rancor. Let the teachings of the Holy Spirit be always with you; and use the virtues as your hands to knock at the doors of Scripture. Then dispassion of heart will arise within you, and during prayer you will see your intellect shine like a star.</p>

   <p> 1. A monk should always act as if he was going to die tomorrow; yet he should treat his body as if it was going to</p>
   <p> live for many years. The first cuts off the inclination to listlessness, and makes the monk more diligent; the second keeps his body sound and his self control well balanced.</p>
   <p> 2.  He who has attained spiritual knowledge and has enjoyed the delight that comes from it will no longer succumb to</p>
   <p> the demon of self-esteem, even when he offers him all the delights of the world; for what could the demon promise him that is greater than spiritual contemplation? But so long as we have not tasted this knowledge, let us devote ourselves eagerly to the practice of the virtues, showing God that our aim in everything is to attain knowledge of Him.</p>
   <p> 3. We should examine the ways of the monks who have preceded us, and achieve our purpose by following their</p>
   <p> example. One of their many helpful counsels is that a frugal and balanced diet, accompanied by the presence of love, quickly brings a monk into the harbor of dispassion.</p>
   <p> 4. Once I visited St Makarios^ at noon and, burning with intense thirst, I asked for a drink of water. But he said: 'Be</p>
   <p> satisfied with the shade, for at this moment there are many travelers who lack even that.' Then, as I was telling him of my difficulties in practicing self-restraint, he said: 'Take heart, my son; for during the whole of twenty years I myself have never had my fill of bread, water or sleep; but I have carefully measured my bread and water, and snatched some sleep by leaning a little against the wall.</p>
   <p> 5. Spiritual reading, vigils and prayer bring the straying intellect</p>
   <p> [VI] 54</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary Extracts from the Texts on Watchfulness</p>
   <p> to stability. Hunger, exertion and withdrawal from the world wither burning lust. Reciting the psalms, long suffering and compassion curb our incensive power when it is unruly. Anything untimely or pushed o excess is short-lived and harmful rather than helpful.</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary On Prayer:</p>
   <p> One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts Prologue</p>
   <p> When suffering from the fever of unclean passions, my inteUect afflicted with shameful thoughts, I have often been restored to health by your letters, as I used to be by the counsel of our great guide and teacher. This is not to be wondered at, since like the blessed Jacob you have earned a rich inheritance. Through your efforts to win Rachel you have been given Leah (cf. Gen. 29: 25), and now you seek to be given Rachel also, since you have labored a further seven years for her sake.</p>
   <p> For myself, I cannot deny that although I have worked hard all night I have caught nothing. Yet at your suggestion I have again let down the nets, and I have made a large catch. They are not big fish, but there are a hundred and fifty-three of them (cf. John 21:11). These, as you requested, I am sending you in a creel of love, in the form of a hundred and fifty-three texts.</p>
   <p> I am delighted to find you so eager for texts on prayer - eager not simply for those written on paper with ink but also for those which are fixed in the intellect through love and generosity. But since 'all things go in pairs, one complementing the other', as the wise Jesus puts it (Eccles. 42:24), please accept the letter and understand its spirit, since every written word presupposes the intellect: for where there is no intellect there is no written word. The way of prayer is also twofold: it comprises practice of the virtues and contemplation. The same applies to numbers: literally they are quantities, but they can also signify qualities.</p>
   <p> I have divided this discourse on prayer into one hundred and fifty-three texts. In this way I send you an evangelical feast, so that</p>
   <p> [VI] 56</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary On Prayer: One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts</p>
   <p> you may delight in a symbolical number that combines a triangular with a hexagonal figure.' The triangle indicates spiritual knowledge</p>
   <p> 1. The number 153 recalls the draught of great fishes' caught by Simon Peter and the Apostles (John 21:11). In this passage Evagrios makes use of a numerical symbolism widely employed in the ancient and medieval world:</p>
   <p> i. A triangular number is the sum total of a continuous series of numerals, starting from the number 1. Thus 3(=l-2), (5(=l+2+3) and 10(=l+2+3+4) are all triangular numbers.</p>
   <p> ii. A square number is obtained by numbering from 1 but omitting one numeral each time. Thus 4(=l+3), 9(=l+3+5) and 16(=l+3+5+7) are square numbers.</p>
   <p> iii. To obtain a pentagonal number, two numerals are omitted each time: 1+4+7+10... etc.; to obtain a hexagonal number, three numerals are omitted: 1+5+9+13...etc.</p>
   <p> iv. A circular or spherical number is one which, when multiplied by itself, reproduces itself again as the last digit: e.g. 5x5 = 25; 6x6 = 36.</p>
   <p> Applying this to the number 153, Evagrios concludes: a. 153 is triangular, being the sum of all numerals up to 17 (inclusive).</p>
   <p> c.  It is the sum of 100 (a square number) and of 53; and 53 is in its turn the sum of 28 (a triangular number: =1+2+3=4+5+6+7) and 25 (a circular spherical number: =5 x 5).</p>
   <p> [VI] 57</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary On Prayer: One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts</p>
   <p> of the Trinity, the hexagon indicates the ordered creation of the world in six days. The number one hundred is square, while the number fifty-three is triangular and spherical; for twenty-eight is triangular, and twenty-five is spherical, five times five being twenty-five. In this way, you have a square figure to express the fourfold nature of the virtues, and also a spherical number, twenty-five, which by form represents the cyclic movement of time and so indicates true knowledge of this present age. For week follows week and month follows month, and time revolves from year to year, and season follows season, as we see from the movement of the sun and moon, of spring and summer, and so on. The triangle can signify knowledge of the Holy Trinity. Or you can regard the total sum, one hundred and fifty-three, as triangular and so signifying respectively the practice of the virtues, contemplation of the divine in nature, and theology or spiritual knowledge of God: faith, hope and love (cf 1 Cor. 13:13); or gold, silver and precious stones (cf 1 Cor. 3:12). So much, then, for this number.</p>
   <p> Do not despise the humble appearance of these texts, for you know how to be content with much or little (cf. Phil. 4:12). You will recall how Christ did not reject the widow's mites (cf. Mark 12:44), but accepted them as greater than the rich gifts of many others. Showing in this way charity and love towards your true brethren, pray for one who is sick that he may 'take up his bed' and walk (Mark 2 :11) by the grace of Christ. Amen.</p>
   <p> 1.  Should one wish to make incense, one will mingle, according to the Law, fragrant gum, cassia, aromatic shell and</p>
   <p> myrrh in equal amounts (cf. Exod. 30:34). These are the four virtues. With their full and balanced development, the intellect will be safe from betrayal.</p>
   <p> 2.  When the soul has been purified through the keeping of all the commandments, it makes the intellect steadfast and</p>
   <p> able to receive the state needed for prayer.</p>
   <p> 3. Prayer is communion of the intellect with God. What state, then, does the intellect need so that it can reach out to</p>
   <p> its Lord without deflection and commune with Him without intermediary?</p>
   <p> 4. When Moses tried to draw near to the burning bush he was forbidden to approach until he had loosed his sandals</p>
   <p> from his feet (cf. Exod. 3:5/ If, then, you wish to behold and commune with</p>
   <p> [VI] 58</p>
   <p> Evagrios the SoHtary On Prayer:</p>
   <p> One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts</p>
   <p> Him who is beyond sense-perception and beyond concept, you must free yourself from every impassioned thought. 5. First pray for the gift of tears, so that through sorrowing you may tame what is savage in your soul. And having</p>
   <p> confessed your transgressions to the Lord, you will obtain forgiveness from Him.</p>
   <p> 6. Pray with tears and all you ask will be heard. For the Lord rejoices greatly when you pray with tears.</p>
   <p> 7. If you do shed tears during your prayer, do not exalt yourself, thinking you are better than others. For your prayer</p>
   <p> has received help so that you can confess your sins readily and make your peace with the Lord through your tears. Therefore do not turn the remedy for passions into a passion, and so again provoke to anger Him who has given you this grace.</p>
   <p> 8. Many people, shedding tears for their sins, forget what tears are for, and so in their folly go astray.</p>
   <p> 9. Persevere with patience in your prayer, and repulse the cares and doubts that arise within you. They disturb and</p>
   <p> trouble you, and so slacken the intensity of your prayer.</p>
   <p> 10.  When the demons see you truly eager to pray, they suggest an imaginary need for various things, and then stir up</p>
   <p> your remembrance of these things, inciting the intellect to go after them: and when it fails to find them, it becomes very depressed and miserable. And when the intellect is at prayer, the demons keep filling it with the thought of these things, so that it tries to discover more about them and thus loses the fruitfulness of its prayer.</p>
   <p> 11. Try to make your intellect deaf and dumb during prayer: you will then be able to pray.</p>
   <p> 12. Whenever a temptation or a feeling of contentiousness comes over you, immediately arousing you to anger or to</p>
   <p> some senseless word, remember your prayer and how you will be judged about it, and at once the disorderly movement within you will subside.</p>
   <p> 13.  Whatever you do to avenge yourself against a brother who has done you a wrong will prove a stumbling-block to</p>
   <p> you during prayer.</p>
   <p> 14. Prayer is the flower of gentleness and of freedom from anger.</p>
   <p> 15. Prayer is the fruit of joy and thankfulness.</p>
   <p> 16. Prayer is the remedy for gloom and despondency.</p>
   <p> 17. 'Go and sell all you have and give to the poor'</p>
   <p> (Matt. 19:21):</p>
   <p> [VI] 59</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary On Prayer: One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts</p>
   <p> and 'deny yourself, taking up your cross' (Matt. 16: 24). You will then be free from distraction when you pray.</p>
   <p> 18. If you wish to pray as you should, deny yourself all the time, and when any kind of affliction troubles you,</p>
   <p> meditate on prayer.</p>
   <p> 19. If you endure something painful out of love for wisdom, you will find the fruit of this during prayer.</p>
   <p> 20. If you desire to pray as you ought, do not grieve anyone: otherwise you 'run in vain' (Phil. 2:16).</p>
   <p> 21. 'Leave your gift before the altar: first go away and be reconciled with your brother' (Matt. 5:24), and when you</p>
   <p> return you will pray without disturbance. For rancor darkens the intellect of one who prays, and extinguishes the light of his prayers.</p>
   <p> 22. Those who store up grievances and rancor in themselves are like people who draw water and pour it into a cask</p>
   <p> full of holes.</p>
   <p> 23. If you patiently accept what comes, you will always pray with joy.</p>
   <p> 24. When you pray as you should, thoughts will come to you which make you feel that you have a real right to be</p>
   <p> angry. But anger with your neighbor is never right. If you search you will find that things can always be arranged without anger. So do all you can not to break out into anger.</p>
   <p> your prayer.</p>
   <p> 26. If you are sparing with your anger you will yourself be spared, and you will show your good sense and will be</p>
   <p> one of those who pray.</p>
   <p> 27. If you arm yourself against anger, then you will never succumb to any kind of desire. Desire provides fuel for</p>
   <p> anger, and anger disturbs spiritual vision, disrupting the state of prayer.</p>
   <p> 28. Do not pray only with outward forms and gestures, but with reverence and awe try to make your intellect</p>
   <p> conscious of spiritual prayer.</p>
   <p> 29.  Sometimes as soon as you start to pray, you pray well; at other times, in spite of great exertion, you do not reach your goal. This is to make you exert yourself still more, so that, having gained the gift of prayer, you keep it safe.</p>
   <p> 30.  When an angel comes to us, all who trouble us withdraw at once, then the intellect is completely calm and prays</p>
   <p> soundly. But at other times, when the attacks of the demons are particularly strong,</p>
   <p> [VI] 60</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary On Prayer: One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts</p>
   <p> the intellect does not have a moment's respite. This is because it is weakened by the passions to which it has succumbed in the past. But if it goes on searching, it will find, and if it knocks, the door will be opened (cf. Matt. 7:8).</p>
   <p> 31. Do not pray for the fulfillment of your wishes, for they may not accord with the will of God. But pray as you</p>
   <p> have been taught, saying: Thy will be done in me (cf Luke 22:42). Always entreat Him in this way - that His will be done. For He desires what is good and profitable for you, whereas you do not always ask for this.</p>
   <p> 32. Often when I have prayed I have asked for what I thought was good, and persisted in my petition, stupidly importuning the will of God, and not leaving it to Him to arrange things as He knows is best for me. But when I have obtained what I asked for, I have been very sorry that I did not ask for the will of God to be done; because the thing turned out not to be as I had thought.</p>
   <p> 33. What is good, except God? Then let us leave to Him everything that concerns us and all will be well. For He who is good is naturally also a giver of good gifts.</p>
   <p> 34. Do not be distressed if you do not at once receive from God what you ask. He wishes to give you something better - to make you persevere in your prayer. For what is better than to enjoy the love of God and to be in communion with Him?</p>
   <p> 35. Undistracted prayer is the highest intellection of the intellect.</p>
   <p> 36. Prayer is the ascent of the intellect to God.</p>
   <p> 37.  If you long for prayer, renounce all to gain all.</p>
   <p> 38. Pray first for the purification of the passions; secondly, for deliverance from ignorance and forgetfulness; and thirdly, for deliverance from all temptation, trial and dereliction.</p>
   <p> everything else 'will be given to you' (Matt. 6:33).</p>
   <p> 40.  It is right to pray not only for your own purification, but also for that of all your fellow men, and so to imitate the</p>
   <p> angels.</p>
   <p> 41. See whether you stand truly before God in your prayer, or are overcome by the desire for human praise, using prolonged prayer as a disguise.</p>
   <p> 42. Whether you pray with brethren or alone, try to pray not simply as a routine, but with conscious awareness of your prayer.</p>
   <p> 43.  Conscious awareness of prayer is concentration accompanied [VI] 61</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary On Prayer: One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts</p>
   <p> by reverence, compunction and distress of soul as it confesses its sins with inward sorrow.</p>
   <p> 44. If your intellect is still distracted during prayer, you do not yet know what it is to pray as a monk; but your prayer is still worldly, embellishing the outer tabernacle.</p>
   <p> 45. When you pray, keep close watch on your memory, so that it does not distract you with recollections of your past. But make yourself aware that you are standing before God. For by nature the intellect is apt to be carried away by memories during prayer.</p>
   <p> 46. While you are praying, the memory brings before you fantasies either of past things, or of recent concerns, or of</p>
   <p> the face of someone who has irritated you.</p>
   <p> 47. The demon is very envious of us when we pray, and uses every kind of trick to thwart our purpose. Therefore he</p>
   <p> is always using our memory to stir up thoughts of various things and our flesh to arouse the passions, in order to obstruct our way of ascent to God.</p>
   <p> 48. When after many attempts the cunning demon fails to hinder the prayer of the righteous man, he slackens his efforts a little, and then gets his own back when the man has finished praying. Either he provokes the man to anger, and so destroys the good effects of the prayer, or else he excites him to senseless pleasure, and so degrades his intellect.</p>
   <p> 49. Having prayed as you should, expect the demon to attack you: so stand on guard, ready to protect the fruits of your prayer. For this from the start has been your appointed task: to cultivate and to protect (cf Gen. 2:15). Therefore, having cultivated, do not leave the fruits unprotected; otherwise you will gain nothing from your prayer.</p>
   <p> 50.  The warfare between us and the demons is waged solely on account of spiritual prayer. For prayer is extremely hateful and offensive to them, whereas it leads us to salvation and peace.</p>
   <p> 51. What is it that the demons wish to excite in us? Gluttony, unchastity, avarice, anger, rancor, and the rest of the</p>
   <p> passions, so that the intellect grows coarse and cannot pray as it ought. For when the passions are aroused in the non-rational part of our nature, they do not allow the intellect to function properly.</p>
   <p> 52. We practice the virtues in order to achieve contemplation of the inner essences (logoi) of created things, and from this we pass to</p>
   <p> [VI] 62</p>
   <p> Evagrios the SoHtary</p>
   <p> On Prayer: One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts</p>
   <p> contemplation of the Logos who gives them their being; and He manifests Himseh" when we are in the state of prayer.</p>
   <p> 53. The state of prayer is one of dispassion, which by virtue of the most intense love transports to the noetic realm the intellect that longs for wisdom.</p>
   <p> 54. He who wishes to pray truly must not only control his mcensive power and his desire, but must also free himself</p>
   <p> from every impassioned thought.</p>
   <p> 55. He who loves God is always communing with Him as his Father, repulsing every impassioned thought.</p>
   <p> 56. One who has attained dispassion has not necessarily achieved pure prayer. For he may still be occupied with thoughts which, though dispassionate, distract him and keep him far from God.</p>
   <p> 57. When the intellect no longer dallies with dispassionate thoughts about various things, it has not necessarily reached the realm of prayer: for it may still be contemplating the inner essences of these things. And though such contemplation is dispassionate, yet since it is of created things, it impresses their forms upon the intellect and keeps it away from God.</p>
   <p> 58. If the intellect has not risen above the contemplation of the created world, it has not yet beheld the realm of God</p>
   <p> perfectly. For it may be occupied with the knowledge of intelligible things and so involved in their multiplicity.</p>
   <p> 59.  If you wish to pray, you have need of God, 'who gives prayer to him who prays' (1 Sam. 2:9. LXX). Invoke Him,</p>
   <p> then, saying: 'Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come' (Matt. 6:9-10) - that is, the Holy Spirit and Thy only-begotten Son. For so He taught us, saying: 'Worship the Father in spirit and in truth' (John 4: 24).</p>
   <p> 60. He who prays in spirit and in truth is no longer dependent on created things when honoring the Creator, but praises Him for and in Himself.</p>
   <p> 61. If you are a theologian, you will pray truly. And if you pray truly, you are a theologian.</p>
   <p> 62. When your intellect in its great longing for God gradually withdraws from the flesh and turns away from all thoughts that have their source in your sense-perception, memory or soul-body temperament, and when it becomes full of reverence and joy,</p>
   <p> [VI] 63</p>
   <p> Evagrios the SoHtary On Prayer: One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts</p>
   <p> then you may conclude that you are close to the frontiers of prayer.</p>
   <p> 63. The Holy Spirit, out of compassion for our weakness, comes to us even when we are impure. And if only He finds our intellect truly praying to Him, He enters it and puts to flight the whole array of thoughts and ideas circling within it, and He arouses it to a longing for spiritual prayer.</p>
   <p> 64. While all else produces thoughts, ideas and speculations in the intellect through changes in the body, the Lord does the opposite: by entering the intellect. He fills it with whatever knowledge He wishes: and through the intellect He calms the uncontrolled impulses in the body.</p>
   <p> 65. Whoever loves true prayer and yet becomes angry or resentful is his own enemy. He is like a man who wants to</p>
   <p> see clearly and yet inflicts damage on his own eyes.</p>
   <p> 66. If you long to pray, do nothing that is opposed to prayer, so that God may draw near and be with you.</p>
   <p> 67. When you are praying, do not shape within yourself any image of the Deity, and do not let your intellect be</p>
   <p> stamped with the impress of any form: but approach the Immaterial in an immaterial manner, and then you will understand.</p>
   <p> suddenly bring before you some strange and alien form, making you imagine in your conceit that the Deity is there. They are trying to persuade you that the object suddenly disclosed to you is the Deity, whereas the Deity does not possess quantity and form.</p>
   <p> 69. When the jealous demon fails to stir up our memory during prayer, he disturbs the soul-body temperament, so as</p>
   <p> to form some strange fantasy in the intellect. Since your intellect is usually preoccupied with thoughts it is easily diverted: instead of pursuing immaterial and formless knowledge, it is deceived, mistaking smoke for light.</p>
   <p> 70. Stand on guard and protect your intellect from thoughts while you pray. Then your intellect will complete its prayer and continue in the tranquility that is natural to it. In this way He who has compassion on the ignorant will come to you, and you will receive the blessed gift of prayer.</p>
   <p> 71. You cannot attain pure prayer while entangled in material</p>
   <p> [VI] 64</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary On Prayer: One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts</p>
   <p> things and agitated by constant cares. For prayer means the shedding of thoughts.</p>
   <p> 72. A man who is tied up cannot run. Nor can the intellect that is a slave to passion perceive the realm of spiritual</p>
   <p> prayer. For it is dragged about by impassioned thoughts and cannot stay still.</p>
   <p> 73. When the. intellect attains prayer that is pure and free from passion, the demons attack no longer with sinister thoughts but with thoughts of what is good. For they suggest to it an illusion of God's glory in a form pleasing to the senses, so as to make it think that it has realized the final aim of prayer. A man who possesses spiritual knowledge has said that this illusion results from the passion of self-esteem and from the demon's touch on a certain area of the brain.</p>
   <p> 74. I think that the demon, by touching this area, changes the light surrounding the intellect as he likes. In this way</p>
   <p> he uses the passion of self-esteem to stir up in the intellect a thought which fatuously attributes form and location to divine and principial knowledge. Not being disturbed by impure and carnal passions, but supposing itself to be in a state of purity, the intellect imagines that there is no longer any adverse energy within it. It then mistakes for a divine manifestation the appearance produced in it by the demon, who cunningly manipulates the brain and converts the light surrounding the intellect into a form, as we have described.</p>
   <p> 75. When the angel of God comes to us, with his presence alone he puts an end to all adverse energy within the intellect and makes its light energize without illusion.</p>
   <p> 76. The statement in the Apocalypse that the angel brought incense and offered it with the prayers of the saints (cf. Rev. 8:3) refers, I think, to this grace which is energized through the angel. For it instills knowledge of true prayer, so that the intellect stands firm, free from all agitation, hstlessness and negligence.</p>
   <p> 77. The bowls of incense which the twenty-four elders offered are said to be the prayers of the saints. By a bowl should be understood friendship with God or perfect spiritual love, whereby prayer is energized in spirit and in truth.</p>
   <p> 78. When you think that you do not need tears for your sins during prayer, reflect on this: you should always be in</p>
   <p> God, and yet you are still far from Him. Then you will weep with greater feeling.</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary On Prayer:</p>
   <p> One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts</p>
   <p> 79. Surely, when you do realize where you are, you will gladly sorrow and, like Isaiah, will reproach yourself because, being unclean, and dwelling in the midst of an unclean people - that is, of enemies - you dare to stand before the Lord of hosts (cf Isa. 6:5).</p>
   <p> 80. If you pray truly, you will gain great assurance; angels will come to you as they came to Daniel, and they will</p>
   <p> illuminate you with knowledge of the inner essences of created things (cf. Dan. 2:19).</p>
   <p> 81. Know that the holy angels encourage us to pray and stand beside us, rejoicing and praying for us (cf Tobit</p>
   <p> 12:12). Therefore, if we are negligent and admit thoughts from the enemy, we greatly provoke the angels. For while they struggle hard on our behalf we do not even take the trouble to pray to God for ourselves, but we despise their services to us and, abandoning their Lord and God, we consort with unclean demons.</p>
   <p> 82. Pray gently and calmly, sing with understanding and rhythm, then you will soar like a young eagle high in the</p>
   <p> heavens.</p>
   <p> 83.  Psalmody calms the passions and curbs the uncontrolled impulses in the body: and prayer enables the intellect to</p>
   <p> activate its own energy.</p>
   <p> 84. Prayer is the energy which accords with the dignity of the intellect; it is the intellect's true and highest activity.</p>
   <p> 85. Psalmody appertains to the wisdom of the world of multiplicity; prayer is the prelude to the immaterial knowledge of the One.</p>
   <p> 86.  Spiritual knowledge has great beauty: it is the helpmate of prayer, awakening the noetic power of the intellect to</p>
   <p> contemplation of divine knowledge.</p>
   <p> 87. If you have not yet received the gift of prayer or psalmody, persevere patiently and you will receive it.</p>
   <p> 88.  'And He spake a parable to them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to lose heart.' So do not lose</p>
   <p> heart and despair because you have not yet received the gift of prayer. You will receive it later. In the same parable we read: 'Though I do not fear God, or man's opinion, yet because this widow troubles me, I will vindicate her.' Similarly, God will speedily vindicate those who cry</p>
   <p> [VI] 66</p>
   <p> Evagrios the SoHtary On Prayer: One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts</p>
   <p> to Him day and night (cf Luke 18:1-8). Take heart, then, and persevere diligently in holy prayer.</p>
   <p> 89.  You should wish for your affairs to turn out, not as you think best, but according to God's will. Then you will be</p>
   <p> undisturbed and thankful in your prayer.</p>
   <p> 90. Even if you think you are with God, be on your guard against the demon of unchastity. For he is very wily and</p>
   <p> jealous: he tries to outwit the activity and watchfulness of your intellect and to draw it away from God, when it stands before Him with reverence and fear. 9L If you cultivate prayer, be ready for the attacks of demons and endure them resolutely; for they will come at you like wild beasts and maltreat your whole body.</p>
   <p> 92. Prepare yourself like an experienced fighter, and even if you see a sudden apparition do not be shaken; and should you see a sword drawn against you, or a torch thrust into your face, do not be alarmed. Should you see even some loathsome and bloody figure, do not panic; but stand fast, boldly affirming your faith, and you will be more resolute in confronting your enemies.</p>
   <p> 93. He who bears distress patiently will attain joy, and he who endures the repulsive will know delight.</p>
   <p> 94. Take care that the crafty demons do not deceive you with some vision; be on your guard, turn to prayer and ask</p>
   <p> God to show you if the intellection comes from Him and, if it does not, to dispel the illusion at once. Do not be afraid, for if you pray fervently to God, the demons will retreat, lashed by His unseen power.</p>
   <p> 95. You should be aware of this trick: at times the demons split into two groups; and when you call for help against</p>
   <p> one group, the other will come in the guise of angels and drive away the first, so that you are deceived into believing that they are truly angels.</p>
   <p> 96. Cultivate great humility and courage, and you will escape the power of the demons; 'no plague shall come near your dwelling, for He shall give His angels charge over you' (Ps. 91:10-11). And they will invisibly repel all the energy of the enemy.</p>
   <p> 97. He who practices pure prayer will hear the demons crashing and banging, shouting and cursing; yet he will not</p>
   <p> be overwhelmed or go out of his mind. But he will say to God: 'I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me' (Ps. 23:4), and other words of this kind.</p>
   <p> 98. At the time of such trials, use a brief but intense prayer.</p>
   <p> 99.  If the demons suddenly threaten to appear out of the air, to [VI] 67</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary On Prayer:</p>
   <p> One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts</p>
   <p> make you panic and to take possession of your intellect, do not be frightened and pay no attention to their threats. For they are trying to terrify you, to see if you take notice of them or scorn them utterly.</p>
   <p> 100. When you stand in prayer before God the Almighty, who created all things and takes thought for all, why are you so foolish as to forget the fear of God and to be scared of mosquitoes and cockroaches? Have you not heard it said, 'You shall fear the Lord your God' (Deut. 6:13); or again 'Fear and dread shall fall upon them' (Exod. 15:16)?</p>
   <p> 101. Bread is food for the body and holiness is food for the soul; spiritual prayer is food for the intellect.</p>
   <p> 102.  When you are in the inner temple pray not as the Pharisee but as the publican, so that you too are set free by the Lord (cf Luke 18:10-14).</p>
   <p> 103.  Try not to pray against anyone in your prayer, so that you do not destroy what you are building, and make your prayer loathsome.</p>
   <p> 104.  Learn from the man who owed the ten thousand talents that, if you do not forgive your debtor, you yourself will not be forgiven. For it is said, 'He delivered him to the tormentors' (Matt. 18:34).</p>
   <p> 105. Detach yourself from concern for the body when you pray: do not let the sting of a flea or a fly, the bite of a louse or a mosquito, deprive you of the fruits of your prayer.</p>
   <p> 106.  We have heard that the evil one attacked a certain saint so fiercely as he prayed that, when the saint lifted up his hands, the evil one changed himself into a lion and raising his front legs fixed his claws into the saint's thighs; and he kept them there until the saint lowered his hands, which was only when he had come to the end of his usual prayers.</p>
   <p> 107. There is too the case of that great monk, John the Small. He lived the hesychastic life in a pit, and his communion with God was not interrupted even when a demon in the form of a serpent wound itself round him, chewed his flesh and spat it out into his face.</p>
   <p> 108. You have surely read the lives of the monks of Tabennesis. When Abba Theodore was preaching to the brethren, two vipers crawled under his feet: but he calmly made an arch of his feet and let them stay there until he had finished his sermon. Then he showed the vipers to the brethren and told them what had happened.</p>
   <p> [VI] 68</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary On Prayer: One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts</p>
   <p> 109. We read how, when another spiritual brother was praying, a viper came and wound itself round his leg. But he did not lower his hands until he had finished all his usual prayers; and because he loved God more than himself, he was not harmed at all.</p>
   <p> 110.  Do not let your eyes be distracted during prayer, but detach yourself from concern with body and soul, and give all your attention to the intellect.</p>
   <p> 111. Another saint living the hesychastic life in the desert was attacked, as he was praying, by demons who for two weeks tossed him like a ball in the air, catching him in his rush-mat. They were completely unsuccessful in distracting his mind from fiery prayer.</p>
   <p> 112. When another monk was practicing inner prayer as he journeyed in the desert, two angels came and walked on either side of him. But he paid no heed to them, for he did not wish to lose what was better. He remembered the words of the Apostle: 'Neither angels, nor principalities, nor powers . . . shall be able to separate us from the love of Christ* (Rom. 8: 38-39).</p>
   <p> 113. The monk becomes equal to the angels through prayer, because of his longing to 'behold the face of the Father who is in heaven' (cf. Matt. 18:10).</p>
   <p> 114. Never try to see a form or shape during prayer.</p>
   <p> 115. Do not long to have a sensory image of angels or powers or Christ, for this would be madness: it would be to take a wolf as your shepherd and to worship your enemies, the demons.</p>
   <p> 116. Self-esteem is the start of illusions in the intellect. Under its impulse, the intellect attempts to enclose the Deity in shapes and forms.</p>
   <p> 117. 1 shall say again what 1 have said elsewhere: blessed is the intellect that is completely free from forms during prayer.</p>
   <p> 118. Blessed is the intellect that, undistracted in its prayer, acquires an ever greater longing for God.</p>
   <p> 119. Blessed is the intellect that during prayer is free from materiality and stripped of all possessions.</p>
   <p> 120. Blessed is the intellect that has acquired complete freedom from sensations during prayer.</p>
   <p> 121. Blessed is the monk who regards every man as God after God.</p>
   <p> 122. Blessed is the monk who looks with great joy on everyone's salvation and progress as if they were his own.</p>
   <p> [VI] 69</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary On Prayer: One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts</p>
   <p> 123. Blessed is the monk who regards himself as 'the off-scouring of all things' (1 Cor. 4:13).</p>
   <p> 124. A monk is one who is separated from all and united with all.</p>
   <p> 125. A monk is one who regards himself as linked with every man, through always seeing himself in each.</p>
   <p> 126. The man who always dedicates his first thoughts to God has perfect prayer.</p>
   <p> 127. If you want to pray as a monk, shun all lies and take no oath. Otherwise you vainly pretend to be what you are not.</p>
   <p> 128. If you wish to pray in spirit, be detached from the flesh, and no cloud will darken you during prayer.</p>
   <p> 129. Entrust to God the needs of your body, and it will be clear that you entrust to Him the needs of your spirit also.</p>
   <p> 130.  If you receive what has been promised, you will reign over all things, and, keeping these promises in mind, you will gladly endure your present poverty, spiritual and material.</p>
   <p> 131. Do not shun poverty and affliction, the fuel that gives wings to prayer.</p>
   <p> 132. Let the virtues of the body lead you to those of the soul; and the virtues of the soul to those of the spirit; and these, in turn, to immaterial and principial knowledge.</p>
   <p> 133. If you are praying to overcome some thought, and it subsides easily, examine carefully how this has come about; otherwise you may be deluded into attributing the cause to yourself.</p>
   <p> 134. There are times when the demons suggest thoughts to you and then urge you to rebut them with prayer; whereupon they withdraw of their own accord, so as to deceive you into imagining that you have begun to overcome such thoughts and to rout the demons.</p>
   <p> 135. If you pray to overcome a passion or a demon who is troubling you, remember the words: '1 will pursue my enemies, and overtake them: and 1 will not turn back until they are consumed. 1 will dash them to pieces and they shall not be able to stand: they shall fall under my feet' (Ps. 18:37-38. LXX). Say this when needed and so arm yourself with humility against your enemies.</p>
   <p> 136.  Do not think that you have acquired holiness unless you have reached the point of shedding your blood to attain it. For, according to the Apostle, we must battle unremittingly against sin even if it means death (cf. Eph. 6:11-17;Heb. 12:4).</p>
   <p> [VI] 70</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary On Prayer: One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts</p>
   <p> 137. If you do good to one person, you may be wronged by another and so feel injured, and say or do something stupid, thus dissipating by your bad action what you gained by your good action. This is just what the demons want; so always be attentive.</p>
   <p> 138. Be ready for the attacks of the demons, and think how to avoid becoming their slave.</p>
   <p> 139.  At night the cunning demons try to disturb the spiritual teacher by direct attack; in the daytime, they attack him through other people, besieging him with slander, distraction and danger.</p>
   <p> 140. Do not try to avoid the fullers. Let them beat, trample, stretch and smooth; and your garments will be all the brighter.</p>
   <p> 141. So long as you have not renounced the passions, and your intellect is still opposed to holiness and truth, you will not find the fragrance of incense in your breast.</p>
   <p> 142. Do you have a longing for prayer? Then leave the things of this world and live your life in heaven, not just theoretically but in angelic action and godlike knowledge.</p>
   <p> 143. If it is only in times of adversity that you remember the Judge and how awe-inspiring and impartial He is, you have not yet learned 'to serve the Lord with fear and rejoice in Him with trembling' (Ps. 2:11). For even in a state of spiritual peace and blessedness you should still worship Him with reverence and awe.</p>
   <p> 144. Until a man is completely changed by repentance, he will be wise always to remember his sins with sorrow and to recall the eternal fire which they justly deserve.</p>
   <p> even to embark upon immaterial prayer, he deserves the rebuke given by the Apostle: for it is dangerous for him to pray with head bare and uncovered. Such a soul, he says, ought 'to have a veil on her head because of the angels' who are present (cf. 1 Cor. 11 :5-l), and to be clothed in due reverence and humility.</p>
   <p> 146. Just as persistent staring at the sun in its noonday brilliance will not cure a man suffering from ophthalmia, so the counterfeit practice of fearful and supernal prayer - which is properly to be performed in spirit and in truth -will in no way benefit an intellect that is passionate and impure; on the contrary, such practice will provoke the wrath of God against the intellect.</p>
   <p> 147. If He who is in want of nothing and shows no favors did</p>
   <p> [VI] 71</p>
   <p> Evagrios the Solitary On Prayer:</p>
   <p> One Hundred and Fifty-Three Texts</p>
   <p> not receive the man coming with a gift to the altar until he was reconciled with his neighbor who had something against him (cf Matt. 5:23-24), consider how much we must be on guard and use discrimination if we are to offer at the spiritual altar incense that is acceptable to God.</p>
   <p> 148. Do not delight in words or in glory. Otherwise the demons  will no longer work behind your back, but openly before your face: and they will laugh you to scorn during prayer, drawing you away and enticing you into strange thoughts.</p>
   <p> 149. If you seek prayer attentively you will find it; for nothing is more essential to prayer than attentiveness. So do all you can to acquire it.</p>
   <p> 150. As sight is superior to all the other senses, so prayer is more divine than all the other virtues.</p>
   <p> 151. The value of prayer lies not in mere quantity but in its qualit\'. This is shown by the contrast of the two men who went up into the temple (cf. Luke 18:10), and by the injunction: 'When you pray, do not use vain repetitions' (Matt. 6:7).</p>
   <p> 152. So long as you give attention to the beauty of the body, and your intellect delights in the outside of the tabernacle, you have not yet perceived the realm of prayer and are still far from treading its blessed path.</p>
   <p> 153. If when praying no other joy can attract you, then truly you have found prayer.</p>

   <p> Introductory Note</p>
   <p> St John Cassian, often styled 'Cassian the Roman' in Greek sources, was born around the year 360, probably in Roman Scythia. As a young man he joined a monastery in Bethlehem, but around 385-6 he traveled with his friend Germanos to Egypt, where he remained until 399, becoming a disciple of Evagrios. During 401-5 he was at Constantinople, where he was ordained deacon; here he became a disciple and ardent supporter of St John Chrysostom. In 405 he traveled to the West, remaining for some years in Rome and then moving to Gaul. Either in Rome or in Gaul he was ordained priest. Around 415 he founded two monasteries near Marseilles, one for men and the other for women. His two main works are the Institutes and the Conferences, both written in Latin around the years 425-8. In these Cassian summarized the spiritual teaching which he had received in Egypt, adapting it to the somewhat different conditions of the West. His writings exercised a formative influence on Latin monasticism and are especially commended in the Rule of St Benedict. Cassian died around 435 and is commemorated in the Orthodox Church as a saint, his feast-day falling on 29 Februaiy.</p>
   <p> St Nikodimos included in the PhilokaUa a Greek summary of certain parts of Cassian's main writings. The first text. On the Eight Vices, is taken from the Institutes, Books V-XII; the second text. On the Holy Fathers ofSketis and on Discrimination, comes from the Conferences, Books I-II. In both cases the Greek version considerably abbreviates the Latin original.'</p>

   <p> St John Cassian</p>
   <p> On the Eight Vices Written for Bishop Kastor</p>
   <p> Having composed the treatise on coenobitic institutions, I am now once more encouraged by your prayers to attempt to write something about the eight vices: gluttony, unchastity, avarice, anger, dejection, hstlessness, self-esteem and pride.</p>
   <p> On Control of the Stomach</p>
   <p> I shall speak first about control of the stomach, the opposite to gluttony, and about how to fast and what and how much to eat. I shall say nothing on my own account, but only what I have received from the Holy Fathers. They have not given us only a single rule for fasting or a single standard and measure for eating, because not everyone has the same strength; age, illness or delicacy of body create differences. But they have given us all a single goal: to avoid</p>
   <p> over-eating and the filling of our bellies. They also found a day's fast to be more beneficial and a greater help toward purity than one extending over a period of three, four, or even seven days. Someone who fasts for too long, they say, often ends up by eating too much food. The result is that at times the body becomes enervated through undue lack of food and sluggish over its spiritual exercises, while at other times, weighed down by the mass of food it has eaten, it makes the soul listless and slack.</p>
   <p> They also found that the eating of greens or pulse did not agree with everyone, and that not everyone could live on dry bread. One man, they said, could eat two pounds of dry bread and still be hungry, while another might eat a pound, or only six ounces, and be satisfied. As I said, the Fathers have handed down a single basic rule</p>
   <p> [VI] 74</p>
   <p> St John Cassian</p>
   <p> On the Eight Vices On Control of the Stomach</p>
   <p> of self-control: 'do not be deceived by the filling of the belly' (Prov. 24:15. LXX), or be led astray by the pleasure of the palate. It is not only the variety of foodstuffs that kindles the fiery darts of unchastity, but also their quantity. Whatever the kind of food with which it is filled, the belly engenders the seed of profligacy. It is not only too much wine that besots our mind: too much water or too much of anything makes it drowsy and stupefied. The Sodomites were destroyed not because of too much wine or too much of other foods, but because of a surfeit of bread, as the Prophet teUs us (cf Ezek. 16:49).</p>
   <p> Bodily illness is not an obstacle to purity of heart, provided we give the body what its illness requires, not what gratifies our desire for pleasure. Food is to be taken in so far as it supports our life, but not to the extent of enslaving us to the impulses of desire. To eat moderately and reasonably is to keep the body in health, not to deprive it of holiness.</p>
   <p> A clear rule for self-control handed down by the Fathers is this: stop eating while still hungry and do not continue until you are satisfied. When the Apostle said, 'Make no provision to fulfill the desires of the flesh' (Rom. 13:14), he was not forbidding us to provide for the needs of life: he was warning us against self-indulgence. Moreover, by itself abstinence from food does not contribute to perfect purity of soul unless the other virtues are active as well. Humility, for example, practiced through obedience in our work and through bodily hardship, is a great help. If we avoid avarice not only by having no money, but also by not wanting to have any, this leads us towards purity of soul. Freedom from anger, from dejection, self-esteem and pride also contributes to purity of soul in general, while self-control and fasting are especially important for bringing about that specific purity of soul which comes through restraint and moderation. No one whose stomach is full can fight mentally against the demon of unchastity. Our initial struggle therefore must be to gain control of our stomach and to bring our body into subjection not only through fasting but also through vigils, labors and spiritual, reading, and through concentrating our heart on fear of Gehenna and on longing for the kingdom of heaven.</p>
   <p> St John Cassian</p>
   <p> On the Eight Vices On the Demon of Unchastity and the Desire of the Flesh</p>
   <p> Our second struggle is against the demon of unchastity and the desire of the flesh, a desire which begins to trouble man from the time of his youth. This harsh struggle has to be fought in both soul and body, and not simply in the soul, as is the case with other faults. We therefore have to fight it on two fronts.</p>
   <p> Bodily fasting alone is not enough to bring about perfect self-restraint and trae purity; it must be accompanied by contrition of heart, intense prayer to God, frequent meditation on the Scriptures, toil and manual labor. These are able to check the restless impulses of the soul and to recall it from its shameful fantasies. Humility of soul helps more than everything else, however, and without it no one can overcome unchastity or any other sin. In the first place, then, we must take the utmost care to guard the heart from base thoughts, for, according to the Lord, 'out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, unchastity' and so on (Matt. 15:19).</p>
   <p> We are told to fast not only to mortify our body, but also to keep our intellect watchful, so that it will not be obscured because of the amount of food we have eaten and thus be unable to guard its thoughts. We must not therefore expend all our effort in bodily fasting; we must also give attention to our thoughts and to spiritual meditation, since otherwise we will not be able to advance to the heights of true purity and chastity. As our Lord has said, we should 'cleanse first the inside of the cup and plate, so that their outside may also be clean' (Matt. 23:26).</p>
   <p> If we are really eager, as the Apostle puts it, to 'struggle lawfully' and to 'be crowned" (2 Tim. 2:5j for overcoming the impure spirit of unchastity, we should not trast in our own strength arid ascetic practice, but in the help of our Master, God. No one ceases to be attacked by this demon until he truly believes that he will be healed and reach the heights of purity not through his own effort and labor, but through the aid and protection of God. For such a victory is beyond man's natural powers. Indeed, he who has trampled down the pleasures and provocations of the flesh is in a certain sense outside the body. Thus, no one can soar to this high and heavenly prize of holiness on his own wings and learn to imitate the angels,</p>
   <p> [VI] 76</p>
   <p> St John Cassian</p>
   <p> On the Eight Vices On the Demon of Unchastity and the Desire of the Flesh</p>
   <p> unless the grace of God leads him upwards from this earthly mire.</p>
   <p> No virtue makes flesh-bound man so like a spiritual angel as does self-restraint, for it enables those still living on earth to become, as the Apostle says, 'citizens of heaven' (cf Phil. 3:20). A sign that we have acquired this virtue perfectly is that our soul ignores those images which the defiled fantasy produces during sleep; for even if the production of such images is not a sin, nevertheless it is a sign that the soul is ill and has not been freed from passion. We should therefore regard the defiled fantasies that arise in us during sleep as the proof of previous indolence and weakness still existing a us; since the emission which takes place while we are relaxed in sleep reveals the sickness that lies hidden in our souls. Because of this the Doctor of our souls has also placed the remedy in the hidden regions of the soul, recognizing that the cause of our sickness lies there when He says: 'Whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart' (Matt. 5:28). He seeks to correct not so much our inquisitive and unchaste eyes as the soul which has its seat within and makes bad use of the eyes which</p>
   <p> God gave it for good purposes. That is why the Book of Proverbs in its wisdom does not say: 'Guard your eyes with all diligence' but 'Guard your heart with all diligence' (Prov. 4:23), imposing the remedy of diligence in the first instance upon that which makes use of the eyes for whatever purpose it desires.</p>
   <p> The way to keep guard over our heart is immediately to expel from the mind every demon-inspired recollection of women - even of mother or sister or any other devout woman - lest by dwelling on it for too long the mind is thrown headlong by the deceiver into debased and pernicious thoughts. The commandment given by God to the first man, Adam, told him to keep watch over the head of the serpent (cf. Gen. 3:15. LXX), that is, over the first inklings of the pernicious thoughts by means of which the serpent tries to creep into our souls. If we do not admit the serpent's head, which is the provocation of the thought, we will not admit the rest of its body - that is, the assent* to the sensual pleasure which the thought suggests - and so debase the mind towards the illicit act itself.</p>
   <p> As it is written, we should 'early in the morning destroy all the wicked of the earth' (Ps. 101:8), distinguishing in the light of divine knowledge' our sinful thoughts and then eradicating them completely from the earth - our hearts -in accordance with the</p>
   <p> [VI] 77</p>
   <p> St John Cassian</p>
   <p> On the Eight Vices</p>
   <p> On the Demon of Unchastity and the Desire of the Flesh</p>
   <p> teaching of the Lord. While the-children of Babylon - by which I mean our wicked thoughts - are still young, we should dash them to the ground and crush them against the rock, which is Christ (cf Ps. 137:9; 1 Cor. 16:4). If these thoughts grow stronger because we assent to them, we will not be able to overcome them without much pain and labor.</p>
   <p> It is good to remember the sayings of the Fathers as well as the passages from Holy Scripture cited above. For example, St Basil, Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, said; 'I have not known a woman and yet I am not a virgin.' He recognized that the gift of virginity is achieved not so much by abstaining from intercourse with woman as by holiness and purity of soul, which in its turn is achieved through fear of God. The Fathers also say that we cannot fully acquire the virtue of purity unless we have first acquired real humility of heart. And we will not be granted true spiritual knowledge so long as the passion of unchastity lies hidden in the depths of our souls.</p>
   <p> To bring this section of our treatise to a close, let us recall one of the Apostle's sayings which further illustrates his teaching on how to acquire self-restraint. He says; 'Pursue peace with all men and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord' (Heb. 12:14). It is clear that he is talking about self-restraint from what follows: 'Lest there be any unchaste or profane person, such as Esau' (Heb. 12:16). The more heavenly and angelic the degree of holiness, the heavier are the enemies' attacks to which it is subjected. We should therefore try to achieve not only bodily control, but also contrition of heart with frequent prayers of repentance, so that with the dew of the Holy Spirit we may extinguish the furnace of our flesh, kindled daily by the king of Babylon with the bellows of desire (cf. Dan. 3:19). In addition, a great weapon has been given us in the form of sacred vigils; for just as the watch we keep over our droughts by day brings us holiness at night. So vigil at night brings purity to the soul by day.</p>
   <p> St John Cassian On the Eight Vices</p>
   <p> On Avarice</p>
   <p> Our third struggle is against the demon of avarice, a demon clearly foreign to our nature, who only gains entry into a monk because he is lacking in faith. The other passions, such as anger and desire, seem to be occasioned by the body and in some sense implanted in</p>
   <p> [VI] 78</p>
   <p> St John Cassian On the Eight Vices</p>
   <p> On Avarice</p>
   <p> us at birth. Hence they are conquered only after a long time. The sickness of avarice, on the contrary, can with diligence and attention be cut off more readily, because ft enters from outside. If neglected, however, it becomes even harder to get rid of and more destructive than the other passions, for according to the Apostle it is 'the root of aUevil'Cl Tim. 6:10).</p>
   <p> Let us look at it in this fashion. Movement occurs in the sexual organs not only of young children who cannot yet distinguish between good and evil, but also of the smallest infants still at their mother's breast. The latter, although quite ignorant of sensual pleasure, nevertheless manifest such natural movements in the flesh. Similarly, the incensive power exists in infants, as we can see when they are roused against anyone hurting them. I say this not to accuse nature of being the cause of sin - heaven forbid! - but to show that the incensive power and desire, even if implanted in man by the Creator for a good purpose, appear to change through neglect from being natural in the body into something that is unnatural. Movement in the sexual organs was given to us by the Creator for procreation and the continuation of the species, not for unchastity: while incensive power was planted in us for our salvation, so that we could manifest it against wickedness, but not so that we could act like wild beasts towards our fellow men. Even if we make bad use of these passions, nature itself is not therefore sinful, nor should we blame the Creator. A man who gives someone a knife for some necessary and useful purpose is not to blame if that person uses it to commit murder.</p>
   <p> This has been said to make it clear that avarice is a passion deriving, not from our nature, but solely from an evil and perverted use of our free will. When this sickness finds the soul lukewarm and lacking in faith at the start of the ascetic path, it suggests to us various apparently justifiable and sensible reasons for keeping back something of what we possess. It conjures up in a monk's mind a picture of a lengthy old age and bodily illness; and it persuades him that the necessities of life provided by the monastery are insufficient to sustain a healthy man, much less an ill one; that in the monastery the sick, instead of receiving proper attention, are hardly cared for at all; and that unless he has some money tucked away, he will die a miserable death. Finally, it convinces him that he will not be able to remain long in the monastery because of the load of</p>

   <p> his work and the strictness of the abbot. When with thoughts like these it has seduced his mind with the idea of concealing any sum, however trifling, it persuades him to learn, unknown to the abbot, some handicraft through which he can increase his cherished hoardings. Then it deceives the wretched monk with secret expectations, making him imagine what he will earn from his handicraft, and the comfort and security which will result from it.</p>
   <p> Now completely given over to the thought of gain, he notices none of the evil passions which attack him: his raging fury when he happens to sustain a loss, his gloom and dejection when he falls short of the gain he hoped for. Just as for other people the belly is a god, so for him is money. That is why the Apostle, knowing this, calls avarice not only 'the root of all evil' but 'idolatry' as well (Col. 3:5).</p>

Then he seeks excuses for being angry or injured, so that he will not appear to be leaving the monastery frivolously and without cause. He does not even shrink from trying through gossip and idle talk to seduce someone else into leaving with him, wishing to have an accomplice in his sinful action.</p>
   <p> Because the avaricious monk is so fired with desire for private wealth he will never be able to live at peace in a monastery or under a rule. When like a wolf the demon has snatched him from the fold and separated him from the Hock, he makes ready to devour him: he sets-him to work day and night m his cell on the very tasks which</p>
