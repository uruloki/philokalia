      <p> Again, what we write about the acquisition of the virtues we have learnt from the fathers who were enabled by grace to attain the state of dispassion. For they say that because of his amity with the passions the highly impassioned person becomes like a prisoner and as one who is insensate. Sometimes because of his desire for something he rushes forward thoughtlessly like some mindless thing; at other times.</p>

      <p> XIV Dispassion</p>
      <p> when anger champions desire, he gnashes his teeth like a wild beast at his fellow-men. The man who has attained dispassion becomes impassible out of his perfect love for God. At times he meditates on God, at times on the spectacle of some of God's marvelous works or on a passage from the divine Scriptures, as St Neilos explains. Even if he is in the market place among crowds of people, his intellect acts as if it were alone. This state comes through keeping the divine commandments of Christ: to whom be glory and power throughout the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> Love</p>
      <p> To speak of love is to dare to speak of God; for, according to St John the Theologian, "God is love; and he who dwells in love dwells in God' (1 John 4:16). And the astonishing thing is that this chief of all the virtues is a natural</p>
      <p> virtue. Thus, in the Law, it is given pride of place: 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might' (Deut. 6:5). When I heard the words 'with all your soul' I was astounded, and no longer needed to hear the rest. For 'with all your soul" means with the intelligent, incensive and desiring powers of the soul, because it is of these three powers that the soul is composed. Thus the intellect should think at all times about divine matters, while desire should long constantly and entirely, as the Law says, for God alone and never for anything else; and the incensive power should actively oppose only what obstructs this longing, and nothing else. St John, consequently, was right in saying that God is love. If God sees that, as He commanded, these three powers of the soul aspire to Him alone, then, since He is good. He will necessarily not only love that soul, but through the inspiration of the Spirit will dwell and move within it (cf. 2 Cor. 6:16; Lev. 26:12); and the body, though reluctant and unwilling - for it lacks intelligence - will end by submitting to the intelligence, while the flesh will no longer rise in protest against the Spirit, as St Paul puts it (cf. Gal. 5:17). Just as the sun and moon, at the command of God, travel through the heavens in order to light the world, even though they are soul-less, so the body, at the behest of the soul, will perform works of light. As</p>

      <p> Love</p>
      <p> the sun journeys each day from east to west, thus making one day, while when it disappears night comes, so each virtue that a man practices illumines the soul, and when it disappears passion and darkness come until he again acquires that virtue, and light in this way returns to him. As the sun rises in the furthest east and slowly shifts its rays until it reaches the other extreme, thus forming time, so a man slowly grows from the moment he first begins to practice the virtues' until he attains the state of dispassion. And just as the moon waxes and wanes every month, so with respect to each particular virtue a man waxes and wanes daily, until this virtue becomes established in him. At times, in accordance with God's will, he is afflicted, at times he rejoices and gives thanks to God, unworthy as he is to acquire the virtues; and sometimes he is illumined, sometimes filled with darkness, until his course is finished.</p>
      <p> All this happens to him by God's providence: some things are sent to keep him from self-elation, and others to keep him from despair. Just as in this present age the sun creates the solstices and the moon waxes and wanes, whereas in the age to come there will always be light for the righteous and darkness for those who, like me, alas, are sinners, so, before the attainment of perfect love and of vision in God, the soul in the present world has its solstices, and the intellect experiences darkness as well as virtue and spiritual knowledge; and this continues until, through the acquisition of that perfect love to which all our effort is directed, we are found worthy of performing the works that pertain to the world to be. For it is for love's sake that he who is in a state of obedience obeys what is commanded; and it is for love's sake that he who is rich and free sheds his possessions and becomes a servant, surrendering both what he has and himself to whoever wishes to possess them. He who fasts likewise does so for love's sake, so that</p>
      <p> others may eat what he would otherwise have eaten. In short, every work rightly done is done out of love for God or for one's neighbor. The things we have spoken of, and others like them, are done out of love for one's neighbor, while vigils, psalmody and the like are done out of love for God. To Him be glory, honor and dominion through all the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> XVI Knowledge of God</p>
      <p> All things that God has created have an origin and, if He wishes, an end, since they were brought into existence out of non-existence. God, however/has neither origin nor end. The same is true of His virtues, since He was not at any time without them: He is always beyond goodness, righteous, all-wise, all-powerful, unconquerable, dispassionate, uncircumscribed, infinite, unsearchable, incomprehensible, unending, eternal, uncreated, invariable, unchanging, true, incomposite, invisible, untouchable, ungraspable, perfect, beyond being, inexpressible, inexplicable, full of mercy, full of compassion and sympathy, all-ruling, all-seeing. But, as St Dionysios the Areopagite has said, the fact that God possesses these virtues does not mean that He is compelled to exercise each one of them, as holy men are: He acts virtuously because He chooses to, and uses the virtues as tools with complete freedom and power over them.</p>
      <p> It is from God that, along with their being, angels and holy men have by grace received the virtues, and it is through emulating Him that they become righteous, good and wise. Because they are creatures, they have need of God's assistance and inspiration, for without this they can possess neither virtue nor wisdom. All creatures are susceptible to change, and because they are composed of various elements they are called composite. But God is bodiless, simple, unoriginate, one God, worshipped and glorified by all creation in the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. He who becomes like God has but one will and not many composite wills. His intellect is simple and - so far as this is possible - is always concentrated on what is formless; but by divine providence it descends reluctantly from the realm of the formless to the contemplation of some verse of Scripture or aspect of creation: Yet in order not to be condemned, such a person makes provision for his body, not because in his love for it he wishes to keep it alive, but so as not to make it utterly useless and on this account to incur condemnation.</p>
      <p> For just as the intellect does not reject the passions that surround it, but uses them in accordance with their trae nature, so the soul does not reject the body, but uses it for every good work. And as the</p>

      <p> intellect, controlling the mindless impulses of the passions, directs each of them according to the divine will, so man, controlling the members of his body, makes them subject so a single will and not to many. For he does not allow the four constituent elements of the body, or its many members, to do what they wish, nor does he allow the three faculties of the soul to act, or impel the body to act, thoughtlessly and licentiously; but, guided by spiritual wisdom, he makes the will of the three faculties one and indivisible. Four principles constitute this wisdom: moral judgment, self-restraint, courage and justice. St Gregory the Theologian has written about these most excellently under the inspiration of Jesus Christ our Lord: to whom be glory and dominion throughout the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> XVII Moral Judgment</p>
      <p> Although it is easy for everyone who so wishes to learn from St Gregory about the four principal virtues mentioned above, yet I will speak briefly about each of them here. Every other virtue has need of them, and every undertaking has need of the first - moral judgment - for without it nothing can be brought to a successful conclusion. How can anything be accomplished without moral judgment? It is bom of the intelligence and constitutes the mean between craftiness - that is, excessive astuteness - and thoughtlessness. Craftiness pulls moral judgment towards cunning and guile, and injures the soul of its possessor and as many other people as it can; lack of thought makes one obtuse and trivial, and does not allow the intellect to concentrate on divine matters or on something of profit to one's soul or to one's neighbor. The first is like a high mountain, the second like a ravine.</p>
      <p> The man of moral judgment, then, is he who travels along the plain that lies between these two. But he who strays from this path either falls into the ravine or attempts to climb up into the heights and, not finding a way through, plunges in spite of himself headlong into the ravine; nor - is he able to climb out of it, for he refuses to renounce the</p>

      <p> mountain tops and through repentance to turn back to the path of moral judgment. But the person who has faUen into the ravine calls with humility upon the One who can lead him out again onto the royal road of virtue. The man of moral judgment, however, neither climbs arrogantly upward seeking to harm others, nor descends foolishly only to be harmed by someone else. Choosing the middle way, he keeps to this with the help of Christ our Lord, to whom be glory and dominion throughout the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> XVIII S elf-Restraint</p>
      <p> Self-restraint is a sure and unfailing sense of discretion. It does not permit its possessor to lapse into either licentiousness or obduracy, but safely preserves the blessings reaped through moral judgment while rejecting all that is bad. At the same time it unites to itself the intelligence and through itself leads the intelligence up toward God. Like a good shepherd it folds the sheep - the divine thoughts - and through refraining from what is harmful it slays licentiousness as if it were a mad dog. It expels stupidity as though it were a fierce wolf, and prevents it from devouring the sheep one by one; but it constantly keeps an eye on such stupidity and reveals it to the intelligence, so that it cannot lie hidden in the moonless dark and infiltrate among our thoughts.</p>
      <p> Self-restraint is bom of the desiring power of the soul. Without it, should any good thing come to pass, it cannot be preserved; for without self-restraint the soul's three powers are carried either upward towards licentiousness or downwards towards stupidity. And I do not mean only the licentiousness involved in gluttony and unchastiU', but that involved in every passion and thought not deliberately nurtured in a manner that accords with God's will. For self-restraint disciplines all things and bridles the mindless impulses of soul and body, directing them towards God: to whom be glory throughout the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> XIX Courage</p>
      <p> Courage does not consist in defeating and oppressing one's neighbor; for this is overbearingness, which oversteps the bounds of courage. Nor again does it consist in fleeing terrified from the trials that come as a result of practicing the virtues; for this is cowardice and falls short of courage. Courage itself consists in persisting in every good work and in overcoming the passions of soul and body. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, that is, against men, as was the case with the Jews of old, where to conquer other nations was to do the work of God; it is against principalities and powers, that is, against the unseen demons (cf. Eph. 6:12). He who is victorious conquers spiritually; otherwise he is conquered by the passions. The warfare described in the Old Testament prefigures our spiritual warfare.</p>
      <p> These two passions of overbearingness and cowardice, though they appear to be opposites, are both caused by weakness. Overbearingness pulls one upwards and is outwardly something startling and frightening, like some powerless bear, while cowardice flees like a chased dog. No one who suffers from either of these two passions puts his trust in the Lord, and therefore he cannot stand firm in battle, whether he is overbearing or cowardly. But the righteous man is as bold as a lion (cf. Prov. 28:1) in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be glory and dominion throughout the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> Justice</p>
      <p> St Dionysios the Areopagite says that God is praised through justice. This is true; for without justice all things are unjust and cannot endure. Justice is sometimes called discrimination: it establishes the just mean in every undertaking, so that there will be no falling short due to over-frugality, or excess on account of greed. For even if</p>

      <p> Book 11</p>
      <p> Twenty-Four Discourses</p>
      <p> Justice</p>
      <p> over-frugality and greed appear to be opposites, the one below and the other above justice, yet they both push us in some way towards injustice. Whether a line is convex or concave, it still deviates from what is straight; and to whichever side the balance tilts, that side gets the better of the other side. But the person able to hold fast to justice is neither dragged down through thoughtlessness, licentiousness, cowardice or greed, like the serpent that goes on its belly eating dust (cf Gen. 3:14), a slave to the shameless passions: nor does he fall victim to craftiness and overbearmgness, to stupidity and over-frugality, to excessive astuteness and cunning. Rather, he 'judges with self-restraint' (Rom. 12:3) and endures with patient humility, fully acknowledging that whatever he possesses he has received by grace, as St Paul puts it (cf 1 Cor. 4:7). For he does an injustice to himself and to his neighbor - or, rather, to God - when he ascribes his own achievements to himself. If he thinks that any good thing he possesses is due to himself, then what he thinks that he has will be taken away from him, to use the words of our Lord (cf. Matt. 13:12): to whom be glory and dominion throughout the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> Peace</p>
      <p> When the Lord said to the apostles, "My peace I give unto you". He added 'not as the world gives' (John 14:27). He did not, that is to say, give peace in a simple, conventional manner, as people do when they greet one another with the words 'Peace to you", or as the Shunammite woman did when she said 'Peace be with you' (cf. 2 Kgs. 4:23. LXX). Nor did Christ mean the peace that Elisha had in mind when he told Gehazi to say to the Shunammite, 'Is there peace with you?' (cf. 2 Kgs. 4:26. LXX)-in other words, is there peace with your husband, is there peace with your son? No, Christ's peace is the peace which transcends every intellect (cf. Phil. 4:7), and which God gives to those who love Him with all their soul, because of the dangers and battles they have been through.. In the same spirit the Lord also said, 'In Me you have peace", and added, "In the world you will experience affliction; but have courage, for I have overcome the</p>
      <p> [V3] 260</p>

      <p> Peace</p>
      <p> world' (John 16:33). By this He meant that though a person may experience many afflictions and dangers at the hands of demons and other men, these will be as nothing if he possesses the Lord's peace. Again He said, 'Be at peace with one another' (Mark 9:50). The Lord said all these things to them in advance because they were going to fight and suffer for His sake.</p>
      <p> In a similar way each of us faithful is attacked and led astray by the passions; but if he is at peace with God and with his neighbor he overcomes them all. These passions are the 'world' which St John the Theologian told us to hate (cf 1 John 2:15), meaning that we are to hate, not God's creatures, but worldly desires. The soul is at peace with God when it is at peace with itself and has become wholly deifomi. It is also at peace with God when it is at peace with all men, even if it suffers terrible things at their hands. Because of its forbearance it is not perturbed, but bears all things (cf 1 Cor. 13:7), wishes good to .all, loves all, both for God's sake and for the sake of their own nature. It grieves for unbelievers because they are destroying themselves, as our Lord and the apostles grieved for them. It prays for the faithful and labors on their behalf, and in this way its own thoughts are filled with peace and it lives in a state of noetic contemplation and pure prayer to God. To Him be glory through all the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> Joy</p>
      <p> 'Rejoice in the Lord", said St Paul (Phil. 3:1). And he was right to say, 'in the Lord'. For if our joy is not in the Lord, not only do we not rejoice, but in all probability we never shall. Job, as he described the life of men, found it full of every kind of affliction (cf. Job 7:1-21), and so also did St Basil the Great. St Gregory of Nyssa said that birds and other animals rejoice because of their lack of awareness, while man, being endowed with intelligence, is never happy because of his grief; For, he says, we shave not been found worthy even to have knowledge of the blessings we have lost. For this reason nature teaches us rather to grieve, since life is full of pain and effort, like a</p>

      <p> XXII</p>
      <p> Joy</p>
      <p> state of exile dominated by sin. But if a person is constantly mindful of God, he will rejoice: as the psalmist says, 'I remembered God, and I rejoiced" (Ps. 77:3. LXX). For when the intellect is gladdened by the remembrance of God, then it forgets the afflictions of this world, places its hope in Him, and is no longer troubled or anxious. Freedom from anxiety makes it rejoice and give thanks; and the grateful offering of thanks augments the gifts of grace it has received. And as the blessings increase, so does the thankfulness, and so does the pure prayer offered with tears of</p>
      <p> joy.</p>
      <p> Slowly the man emerges from the tears of distress and from the passions, and enters fully into the state of spiritual</p>
      <p> joy; Through the things that bring him pleasure, he is made humble and grateful; through trials and temptations his hope in the world to come is consolidated; in both he rejoices, and naturally and spontaneously he loves God and all men as his benefactors. He finds nothing in the whole of creation that can harm him. Illumined by the knowledge of God he rejoices in the Lord on account of all the things that He has created, marveling at the care He shows for His creatures. The person who has attained spiritual knowledge not only marvels at visible things, but also is astounded by his perception of many essential things invisible to those who lack experience of this knowledge.</p>
      <p> Thus he looks with wonder not only on the light of day, but also at the night. For the night is a benediction to all: to those practicing the virtues that pertain to the body it offers stillness and leisure; it encourages the remembrance of death and hell in those who grieve; those engaged in practicing the moral virtues it spurs to study and examine more closely the blessings they have received and the moral state of their soul. In the words of the psalmist, "As you lie in bed, repent of what you say in your heart" (Ps. 4:4. LXX), that is, repent in the stillness of the night, remembering the lapses that occurred in the confusion of the day and disciplining yourself in hymns and spiritual songs (cf Col. 3:16) - m other words, teaching yourself to persist in prayer and psalmody through attentive meditation on what you read. For the practice of the moral virtues is effectuated by meditating on what has happened during the day, so that during the stillness of the night we can become aware of the sins we have committed and can grieve over them.</p>
      <p> When in this way through God's grace we make some progress, [V3] 262</p>
      <p> St Peter of Damaskos</p>
      <p> Book 11</p>
      <p> Twenty-Four Discourses</p>
      <p> XXII</p>
      <p> Joy</p>
      <p> and discover that in truth and not just in fantasy we have realized in either action or thought sonic moral virtue of soul or body according to Christ's commandment, then we give thanks with fear and humility; and we struggle to preserve that moral virtue by means of prayer and many tears offered to God, disciplining ourselves to remember it lest we lose it again because of forgetfulness. For it takes much time to make a moral virtue effective in ourselves, while .what has been achieved with so much time and effort can be lost in a single instant.</p>
      <p> All this applies to those practicing the virtues. Where the contemplative life is concerned, the night supplies us with many themes for contemplation, as St Basil the Great has said. First of all, it reminds us daily of the creation of the world, since all creation becomes invisible because of the darkness, as it was before it came into existence. This in its turn prompts us to reflect how the sky was empty then and without stars, as happens now when they become invisible because of the clouds. When we enter our cell and see only darkness, we are reminded of the darkness that was over the abyss (cf. Gen. 1:2); and when suddenly the sky becomes clear again, and we stand outside our cell, we</p>
      <p> are struck by wonder at the world above, and offer praise to God, just as the angels are said in the Book of Job to have praised God when they saw the stars (of. Job 38:7). We see in the mind's eye the earth as it was originally, invisible and without form (cf. Gen. 1:2), and men held fast by sleep as if they did not exist. We feel ourselves alone in the world like Adam and, united with the angels, in fall knowledge we praise the Maker and Creator of the universe.</p>
      <p> In thunder and lightning we see the day of judgment; in the call of cocks we hear the trumpet that will sound on that day (cf. 1 Thess. 4:16); in the rising of the morning star and the light of dawn we perceive the appearance of the precious and life-giving Cross (cf. Matt. 24:30); in men's rising from sleep we see a sign-of the resurrection of the dead, and in the rising of the sun a token of the second advent of Christ. Some, like the saints caught up in clouds on the last day (cf. 1 Thess. 4:17), we see go forth to greet Him with song, while others, like those who will then be judged, are indifferent and remain asleep. Some we see rejoicmg throughout the day in the</p>

      <p> offering of praise, in contemplation and prayer, and in the other virtues, living in the light of spiritual knowledge, as will the righteous at the second coming; while others we see persisting in the passions and m the darkness of ignorance, as will sinners on that day.</p>
      <p> In short, the man of spiritual knowledge finds that everything contributes to his soul's salvation and to God's glory: indeed, it was because of this glory that all things were brought into existence by the Lord and God of knowledge, as Hannah the mother of the prophet Samuel calls Him (cf 1 Sam. 2:3). 'Therefore let the wise man not vaunt himself because of his wisdom," she said, "or the strong man because of his strength, or the rich man because of his wealth; but let him who boasts do so because of his understanding and knowledge of the Lord" (1 Sam. 2:10. LXX). That is to say, let him boast because he knows the Lord with full understanding from His works, and because he imitates Him, so far as is possible, through the keeping of His divine commandments. For it is through them that he knows God and can "work judgment and righteousness in the midst of the earth" (1 Sam. 2:10. LXX), as God does. Hannah spoke these words prophetically concerning the crucifixion and resurrection of the Lord. The gnostic's aspiration, too, is to suffer with the Lord through the acquisition of the virtues and to be glorified with Him through dispassion and spiritual knowledge, and to boast because of Him, in that, unworthy though he is, he has been enabled by grace to be a servant of such a master and an imitator of His humility. Then "praise will come from God' (cf. 1 Cor. 4:5). But when will that happen? When He says to those on His right hand, 'Come, you blessed, inherit the kingdom" (Matt. 25:34). May we all be found worthy to inherit that kingdom through His grace and love: to Him be gloiy and dominion throughout the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> XXIII</p>
      <p> Holy Scripture</p>
      <p> filled with darkness. For, unless a person attends to what is said in divine Scripture, he will gather but little fruit, even though he sings or reads them frequently. 'Devote yourself to stillness and know", it is written (Ps. 46:10), because such devotion concentrates the intellect: even if it is attentive for only a short time, none the less it knows 'in pan', as St Paul puts it (1 Cor. 13:12). This is especially true of the person who has made  some  progress in the practice of the moral virtues, for this teaches the intellect many things related to its association with the passions. Nevertheless, he does not know all the mysteries hidden by God in each verse of Scripture, but only as much as me purity of his intellect is able to comprehend through God's grace. This is clear from the fact that we often understand a certain passage in the course of our contemplation, grasping one or two of the senses in which it was written; then after a while our intellect may increase in purity and be allowed to perceive other meanings, superior to the first. As a result, in bewilderment and wonder at God's grace and His ineffable wisdom, we are overcome with awe before 'the God of knowledge", as the prophetess Hannah calls Him (cf 1 Sam. 2:3).</p>
      <p> I am not speaking here about the mere act of listening to a passage of Scripture or to some other person; for this does not by itself involve purity of intellect or divine revelation. I am speaking about the person who possesses knowledge but distrusts himself until he finds another passage from Scripture or from one of the saints that confirms his spontaneous knowledge of the scriptural passage or of some sensible or intelligible reality. And if instead of one meaning he should find many as a result of giving attention to either the divine Scriptures or the holy fathers, he should not lose faith and think that there is a contradiction. For one text or object can signify many things. Take clothing, for example: one person may say that it warms, another that it adorns, and another that it protects; yet all three are correct, since clothing is useful alike for warmth, for adornment and for protection. All three have grasped</p>
      <p> the purpose assigned by God to clothing; and Holy Scripture and the very nature of-things themselves confirm it. But if someone whose intention is to rob and pilfer should say that clothing exists in order to be stolen, he would be an utter liar, for neither the Scriptures nor the nature of things suggest that it exists for this purpose; and even the laws punish those who do steal it.</p>
      <p> The same applies to everything, whether visible or invisible, and to [V3] 265</p>

      <p> Book 11</p>
      <p> Twenty-Four Discourses</p>
      <p> XXIII Holy Scripture</p>
      <p> every word of the divine Scriptures. For the saints neither know the whole of God's purpose with regard to every object or scriptural text, nor on the other hand do they write down once and for all everything that they do know. This is because in the first place God is beyond comprehension, and His wisdom is not limited in such a way that an angel or man can grasp it in its entirety. As St John Chrysostom says with regard to a certain point of spiritual exegesis, we say about it as much as should be said at the moment, but God, in addition to what we say, knows other unfathomable meanings as well. And, in the second place, because of men's incapacity and weakness it is not good for even the saints themselves to say all that they know; for they might speak at too great a length, thus making themselves offensive or unintelligible because of the confusion in their reader's mind. As St Gregory the Theologian observes, what is said should be commensurate to the capacity of those to whom it is addressed.</p>
      <p> For this reason the same saint may say one thing about a certain matter today, and another tomorrow; and yet there is no contradiction, provided the hearer has knowledge and experience of the matter under discussion. Again, one saint may say one thing and another say something different about the same passage of the Holy Scriptures, since divine grace often gives varying interpretations suited to the particular person or moment in question. The only thing required is that everything said or done should be said or done in accordance with God's intention, and that it should be attested by the words of Scripture. For should anyone preach anything contrary to God's intention or contrary to the nature of things, then even if he is an angel St Paul's words, 'Let him be accursed' (Gal. 1:8), will apply to him. This is what St Dionysios the Areopagite, St Antony and St Maximos the Confessor affirm. For this reason St John Chrysostom says: 'It was not the Greeks but the Holy Scriptures that transmitted these things to us. There is no contradiction when Scripture says about a certain person both that he did not see Babylon as a captive and, elsewhere, that they took him to Babylon with the rest. For one who reads attentively will find it said about this same man in another part of Scripture that they blinded him and in dm condition took him off as a captive (cf 2 Kgs. 25:7; Jer. 52:11): Thus he went to Babylon, as the one writer says, but did not see it, as the other says.</p>

      <p> Again, some say in their lack of experience that the Epistle to the Hebrews was not written by St Paul, or that St Dionysios the Areopagite did not write one of the treatises ascribed to him. But if a man will pay attention to these same works, he will discover the truth. If the matter pertains to nature, the saints gain their knowledge of it from spiritual insight, that is, from the spiritual knowledge of nature and from the contemplation of created beings that is attained through the intellect's purity; and so they expound God's purpose in these things with complete accuracy. Searching the Scriptures, as St John Chrysostom says, like gold-miners who seek out the finest veins. In this way they ensure that "not the smallest letter or most insignificant accent is lost', as the Lord put it (Matt. 5:18).</p>
      <p> Such is the situation with regard to things that pertain to nature. When the matter in question is something that lies beyond nature, whether it be sensible or intelligible, or even a written phrase, the saints know about it through the gift of prophecy and through revelation, provided that such knowledge is given them by the Holy Spirit. But if this knowledge is not given them, and if for their own good the matter remains beyond their understanding, they are not ashamed to speak the truth and to confess their human weakness, saying with St Paul, 'I do not know; God knows' (2 Cor. 12:2). As Solomon said, "There are three things of which I am ignorant and a fourth which I do not know' (Prov. 30:18. LXX). Again, St John Chrysostom says, 'I do not know; and if the heretics call me an unbeliever, let them call me a tool as well'</p>
      <p> In short, the saints possessed both spiritual and secular knowledge but preferred the first; they made use, however, of their worldly education wisely and for a limited purpose, guided by St Paul's rule not to boast beyond limits (cf. 2 Cor. 10:13), as did those Egyptians who, according to the Clementine writings, mocked the prosaic diction of the Apostle Barnabas, not realizing that his preaching contained words of life (cf. John 6:68). Many of us are guilty of doing the same: when we hear someone speaking with a strange accent we laugh, though he may perhaps be a wise man in his own tongue and be speaking of awe-inspiring mysteries. This happens because of our inexperience. But the fathers themselves often deliberately wrote in a very simple manner, depending on the</p>

      <p> St Peter of Damaskos</p>
      <p> Book 11</p>
      <p> Twenty-Four Discourses</p>
      <p> XXIII Holy Scripture</p>
      <p> particular circumstances and the people for whom they were writing. St Gregory of Nyssa remarks on this when</p>
      <p> praising St Ephrem: though he was wise, says Gregory, he wrote simply. Gregory also marvel at the way in which, being deeply versed in theological doctrine, Ephrem refuted with great learning the accursed hooks of a childish heretic, and how the latter, because of his pride, was unable to bear the shame of this and died.</p>
      <p> Saintly humility is something that transcends nature, and an unbeliever cannot achieve it, but thinks that it is contrary to nature. St Dionysios the Areopagite speaks of this when writing to St Timothy about such men: he says that to the ancients the resurrection of the dead appeared contrary to nature, whereas to himself and to St Timothy -and in the eyes of the truth itself - it is not contrary to nature but it transcends nature. This at least is how it looks to us; in God's eyes, however, it does not transcend nature, but is quite natural; for God's commandment is His nature. The fathers had a special love for humility in action and drought, as did the compiler of the  Gerontikon,  though he was a bishop and in exile for Christ's sake; for he says with regard to the tattered garment of some virgin that he took it in order to receive a blessing. And the holy fathers St Dorotheos and St Cassian, though wise, wrote simply. I say this lest anyone should think that some fathers wrote in a learned manner out of pride, while others wrote in a simple style because of their lack of intelligence. Both alike wrote through the same power of the intellect, conferred by the one Holy Spirit, and their purpose was to be of service to everyone. Had they all written simply, no learned person would ever benefit, for he would regard what was written as worthless because of its pedestrian style; nor on the other hand would a simpler type of person ever benefit had all of them written in a learned style, since he would not have understood the meaning of what was said.</p>
      <p> Whoever is experienced in the spiritual interpretation of Scripture knows that the simplest passage is of a significance equal to that of the most abstruse passage, and that both are directed to the salvation of man. Whoever lacks such experience, however, is often at a loss, being unaware that secular learning is of great help when it acts as a</p>

      <p> vehicle for the higher wisdom of the Sprit For the wisdom of the Spirit bestows inspired thoughts, while secular learning provides power of expression, so long as it is accompanied by moral judgment and by the humility that teaches us to fear both thoughtlessness and craftiness and to "judge with self-restraint', as St Paul puts it (Rom. 12:3).</p>
      <p> Just as the term "amen", which St Luke translates as "truly" (cf. Luke 9:27), is a stable and decisive word endorsing what comes before it, so moral judgment is a stable, and decisive form of intellection enabling us to cleave to the tnith. The word "amen" affirms the permanence of the new grace conferred by Christ; hence it is not found in the Old Testament at all. since the Old Testament is but a prefiguration. In the New Testament, however, it</p>
      <p> is used everywhere because this testament will endure for ever and through all the ages.</p>

      <p> How many tears would I like to shed whenever I gain even a partial glimpse of myself! If I do not sin, I become elated with pride; while if I sin and am able to realize it, in my dismay I lose heart and begin to despair. If I take refuge in hope, again I become arrogant. If I weep, it feeds my presumption; if I do not weep, the passions visit me again. My life is death, yet death seems even worse because of my fear of punishment. My prayer proves a source of temptation to me, and my inattention a cause of disaster. 'He that increases knowledge increases sorrow," says Solomon (Eccles. 1:18). I am at a loss, beside myself, and do not know what to do. And should I know, and then not do it, my knowledge would contribute to my condemnation. Alas, what shall I choose? In my ignorance all things seem contradictory and I cannot reconcile them. I do not find the virtue and wisdom hidden in my trials, since I do not endure these trials with patience. I flee from stillness because of my evil thoughts, and so I find myself beset by the</p>
      <p> [V3] 269</p>

      <p> XXIV Conscious Awareness in the Heart</p>
      <p> passions that tempt me through the senses. I want to fast and to keep vigil, but am impeded by presumption and laxity. I eat and deep lavishly, and sin without knowing it. I withdraw myself from everything and flee out of fear of sm, but listlessness is again my undoing.</p>
      <p> Yet I realize that many, because they had a firm faith, received crowns of victory after going through battles and trials like these. It was because of their faith that they were granted fear of God; and through this fear they were enabled to practice the other virtues. Had I faith as they had, I would have found this fear through which, according to the prophet, I would have received true piety and spiritual knowledge; and from this knowledge would have come strength, counsel, understanding and the wisdom of the Holy Spirit (cf. Isa. 11:2). These are the gifts conferred on</p>
      <p> those who, free from anxiety, wait on God and devote themselves to the Holy Scriptures with the patience that makes it possible to view all things, whether from above or from below, with an equal mind.</p>
      <p> Time and experience make it clear when a particular passion has been transformed into virtue. When, on the other hand, a virtue veers towards passion, time and experience permit us to set them apart through patient endurance. For if such endurance is not bom in the soul out of faith, the soul cannot possess any virtue at all. 'You will gain possession of your souls through your patient endurance', said the Lord (Luke 21:19), who alone has fashioned the hearts of men, as the psalmist puts it (cf. Ps. 33:15). From this it is dear that the heart, that is, the intellect, comes into possession of itself through the patient endurance of what befalls it. For if we believe that someone else is invisibly guiding our life, how can we ever obey our own thoughts when they say 'I want this" or 'I do not want it", 'This is good' or 'This is bad"? If we had some visible guide, we would ask him about everything, would hear the reply and carry into effect what was said. But even when we do not have a visible guide, we do have Christ, as the bishop of Evchaita remarks. We should therefore put questions to Him through prayer from the heart, in faith hoping His answer will manifest itself in our thoughts and actions. Otherwise Satan, not being able to affect us in our actions, may answer us in our</p>
      <p> [V3] 270</p>
      <p> St Peter of Damaskos</p>
      <p> Book 11</p>
      <p> Twenty-Four Discourses</p>
      <p> XXIV Conscious Awareness in the Heart</p>
      <p> thoughts, pretending that he is the guide and in this way dragging us to perdition because we lack patient endurance.</p>
      <p> It is those lacking such endurance who in their ignorance impetuously hurry on to seize what they have not yet been given, failing to realize that one day in the eyes of the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as a single day (cf, Ps. 90:4). But he who by enduring patiently has gained experience of the devil's machinations will fight and strive forward with patience so as to reach the goal, as St Paul puts it (cf. 1 Cor. 9:26; Phil. 3:12). He will be able to say, 'We are not ignorant of Satan's devices' (2 Cor. 2:11), that is, of the devil's invisible ploys, unknown to most men. For St Paul says, "Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light' (2 Cor. 11:14); and there is nothing surprising in this, since the thoughts that he causes to appear in our heart seem to be righteous thoughts to those who lack experience.</p>
      <p> For this reason it is good to say 'I do not know', so that we neither disbelieve what is said by an angel nor place credence in what occurs through the deceitfulness of the enemy. By thus accepting patiently whatever comes we may avoid both pitfalls. We may wait for many years until the answer is given us, unsolicited and unperceived, in the form of some concrete action-as someone has put it with reference to the contemplation of created beings. In this way we reach the haven of active spiritual knowledge. When we see this knowledge persisting in us over many years, then we will understand that truly we have been heard and have invisibly received the answer.</p>
      <p> Someone prays, for example, for victory over those who fight against him. He hears nothing and sees no deceitful sign; or even if he does hear or see something, either in sleep or when awake, he gives it absolutely no credence. But after a certain length of time he observes that the battle is being won by God's grace and that certain thoughts are</p>
      <p> drawing his intellect towards humility and the knowledge of his own weakness. Yet he still does not put his trust in this, fearing that it might be deception, but waits for many years. It was such an attitude, according to St John Chrysostom, that Christ wanted to induce in the apostles: that is why He warned them of coming tribulations, adding, 'He who endures to the end will be saved' (Matt. 10:22), so that they would not grow careless or overconfident, but would</p>

      <p> Book 11</p>
      <p> Twenty-Four Discourses</p>
      <p> XXIV Conscious Awareness in the Heart</p>
      <p> struggle on out of fear. For a person derives no benefit from the other virtues, even though he dwells in heaven, if he is in the grip of the presumption that led to the fall of the devil, Adam and many others.</p>
      <p> Hence we should never abandon fear until we have reached the haven of perfect love and are no longer in the world or the body. Even the person who has reached that haven will not abandon such fear of his own accord. Rather, by virtue of his great faith his intellect is freed from all anxiety about the life and death of the body, and he attains the pure fear that is inspired by love. St Athanasios the Great was referring to this fear when he told the perfect not to fear God as a tyrant, but to fear Him because of His love; that is, they should fear Him not simply because they sin, but because they are loved without themselves showing love, thus receiving His blessings unworthily. It is through fear in the face of such blessings that God leads the soul towards love, so that through its gratitude to Him it may become worthy of the good things that have been and will be bestowed on it. Then by means of the pure fear inspired by love the soul attains the humility that transcends nature.</p>
      <p> For no matter how many blessings a person in the state of pure fear receives, or how many appalling things he suffers, he never for a moment thmks that it is due to his own strength and understanding that he is able to endure or prosper in soul and body. On the contrary, in his humility he has received the discrimination by means of which he realizes that he is a creature of God, and that of himself he can do nothmg good and cannot even preserve what has been given him by grace; and that he can neither remove temptation nor endure it through his own courage and judgment. By means of discrimination he thus attains a certam degree of spiritual knowledge and begins to see all things with the eye of the intellect. But, ignorant of the inner principles of these things, he longs for the Teacher; yet he fails to find Hnn, because He is invisible. At the same time he is unwilling to accept anyone else because his discrimination tells him - although there is no dear evidence for this - that anyone else may be an impostor; so he is at a loss, and as a result regards all that he has done and all that he has been taught as nothing.</p>
      <p> For he sees how many men, beginning with Adam, have fallen in</p>
      <p> St Peter of Damaskos</p>
      <p> Book 11</p>
      <p> Twenty-Four Discourses</p>
      <p> XXIV Conscious Awareness in the Heart</p>
      <p> spite of their efforts and their knowledge; and he reahzes as well that, though he hears, yet he does hot understand what is said in the Holy Scriptures. This knowledge - the knowledge that in fact he does not know as he should know - brings him to tears. It is indeed truly astonishing that, if a man thinks he knows, he knows nothing yet (cf 1 Cor. 8:2); and that what he thinks he has will be taken from him, as the Lord says (cf Matt. 13:12) - that is, will be taken away because he thinks he has it while he does not have it. Thus the man who acknowledges that he is stupid and witless, ignorant and weak, weeps and laments because he thought he had received what he now realizes that he does not have.</p>
      <p> Humility is bom of many virtues, and in its turn gives birth to things more perfect still. It is the same with spiritual knowledge, thanksgiving, prayer and love, since these virtues are always capable of increase. For example, a person becomes humble and grieves because he is a sinner. In consequence of this he begins to practice self-control and patient endurance in the face of afflictions sought and unsought. What comes from the demons he endures through ascetic discipline, and what comes from men he endures as a test of his faith. In this way it becomes dear whether he puts his trust in God, or in man, or in his own strength and judgment. And when his worthiness has been proved by his patient endurance and by his entrusting all things to God, he receives that great faith to which Christ referred when He said, 'When the Son of man comes, will He find faith on the earth?" (Luke 18:8). Through such faith he gains victory over his enemies; and when he has achieved this, then through the power of God and through the wisdom granted him he becomes aware of his own weakness and ignorance.</p>
      <p> As a result of this he begins to give thanks with a humble soul, and he trembles with fear lest he should relapse into disobedience. Because of this pure fear - fear which is not due to the fact that he has sinned - and because of the thankfulness, patient endurance and humility which have been bestowed on him as a result of his knowledge, he begins to have hope that by God's grace he will obtain mercy. In the light of his experience of the blessings he has received, he watches and fears lest he should be found unworthy of such gifts from God. Hence he receives greater humility and more intense prayer from the heart; and the more these increase, together with thankfulness, the greater the knowledge he receives. Thus he</p>
      <p> [V3] 273</p>
      <p> St Peter of Damaskos</p>
      <p> Book 11</p>
      <p> Twenty-Four Discourses</p>
      <p> XXIV Conscious Awareness in the Heart</p>
      <p> advances from knowledge to fear, and from fear to thankfulness, and so he attains the knowledge that transcends all these. As a consequence, he comes truly to love his Benefactor and longs to serve Him with joy, indebted as he is to God for the knowledge bestowed upon him.</p>
      <p> At once he receives a still farther increase of knowledge, and he contemplates not just the blessings he personally has been granted, but also those that are universal. Not being able to give thanks adequately for these, he grieves; and then, again marveling at the grace of God, he is consoled. At times he weeps painfully; at tnnes, because of his love, his tears are made sweeter than honey by the spiritual joy that comes from ineffable humility. When in trath he longs for God's will to be done in everything and abhors every honor and comfort; when he regards himself as lower than all other men and does not even think that he is anybody at all, but holds himself indebted to God and to all men as much as to God, then he will consider trials and afflictions to be great blessings, and enjoyment and comfort to be extremely harmful. For trials and afflictions he longs with all his soul, wherever they may come from; enjoyment and comfort he fears, even though they may be sent by God to test him.</p>
      <p> While he is experiencing the tears of which we have spoken, his intellect begins to attain purity and to return to its pristine state, that is, to the state of natural spiritual knowledge which it lost through its amity with the passions. By some this is called moral judgment, since the intellect 'then sees things as they are by nature; by others it is called spiritual insight, since he who possesses it knows something at least of the hidden mysteries - that is, of God's purpose-in the Holy Scriptures and in every created thing. Such natural knowledge springs from discrimination, and enables us to perceive the inner principles of things sensible and intelligible. On account of this it is known as the contemplation of created beings, that is, of God's creation. It is natural and comes from purity of intellect. But if for the common good a person receives the gift of prophecy, he has attained something that transcends nature; for only God foreknows all things, as well as the purpose for which He created each thing and inspired each word of Holy Scripture; and it is by grace that He grants such knowledge to the saints.</p>
      <p> Thus, the contemplation of sensible and intelligible creation.</p>
      <p> [V3] 274</p>
      <p> St Peter of Damaskos</p>
      <p> Book 11</p>
      <p> Twenty-Four Discourses</p>
      <p> XXIV Conscious Awareness in the Heart</p>
      <p> sometimes called moral judgment, is also a form of spiritual insight and of natural spiritual knowledge - 'natural' since it pre-exists in nature. But when the passions darken the intellect, it is lost; and unless God removes the passions through our practice of the virtues, the intellect remains blinded. The gift of prophecy, however, is of a different order, for it transcends nature and is granted only by grace. Yet even natural spiritual knowledge cannot be attained without God, though it is natural; for the pagan Greeks perceived many things but, as St Basil the Great has said, they were unable to discern God's purpose in created beings, or even God Himself, since they lacked the humility and the faith of Abraham.</p>
      <p> A person is said to have faith when, on the basis of what he can see, he believes in what he cannot see. But to believe in what we can see of God's works is not the same as to believe in Him who teaches and proclaims the truth to us. Hence the trials sent to test our faith are visible, while God's assistance comes to us invisibly. In this way, the person who in faith endures these trials patiently will discover, once they have passed, that he has acquired spiritual knowledge, through which he knows things previously unknown to him, and that blessings have been bestowed on him. As a result he gains humility together with love both towards God, as his benefactor, and towards his fellow-men for the healing wrought by God through them. He regards this as something "natural, and yet as a debt, which fills him with the desire to keep God's commandments. He hates the passions as his enemies and pays scant attention to the body, considering it an obstacle to his attainment of dispassion and of the knowledge of God, that is, of hidden wisdom" (1 Cor, 2:7).</p>
      <p> This wisdom is rightly called 'hidden'. If someone seeks for success and pleasure, comfort and glory in this world, then he loves the wisdom of this world. But if someone struggles for what is contrary to these things - if he suffers, practices self-control, and endures all kinds of affliction and disgrace for the sake of the kingdom of heaven - then he loves the wisdom of God. The first longs to attain material benefits, secular learning and secular power, and often suffers on this account; but the second shares the sufferings of Christ. Thus the first places all his hopes in the things of this world, desiring to possess them even though they are transitory and hard to come by; while the second is hidden from "the eyes of the foolish", as Holy Scripture puts it (Wisd. 3:2), but is clearly revealed in the world to come, when everything</p>
      <p> [V3]275</p>

      <p> Book 11</p>
      <p> Twenty-Four Discourses</p>
      <p> XXIV Conscious Awareness in the Heart</p>
      <p> hidden is disclosed. Moreover, according to St John Chrysostom the knowledge of what is hidden-that is, the contemplation of the divine Scriptures and of created beings-is given as an encouragement to those who grieve in this world. For from faith is bom fear, and from fear comes inward grief. This in turn produces humility, which gives rise to discrimination. Discrimination, finally, gives birth to spiritual insight and, by God's grace, to the gift of prophecy.</p>
      <p> The gnostic ought not to rely in any way on his own thoughts, but should always seek to confirm them in the light of divine Scripture or of the nature of things themselves. Without such confirmation, there can be no trae spiritual knowledge, but only wickedness and delusion, as St Basil the Great says when speaking about the stars. Divine Scripture names only a few stars, while the pagan Greeks in their delusion give names to many. For the intention of divine Scripture is to speak of things that can save the soul, and to reveal to us the mysteries it contains in itself, as well as the inner principles of created beings, that is, the purpose for which each thing was created. In this way it aims to illumine our intellect with the love of God, and to enable it to perceive His greatness and His inexpressible wisdom and providence, as they are revealed in His care for His creation. Such knowledge makes us afraid of breaking His commandments and conscious of our own weakness and ignorance. This in its turn makes us humble and teaches us to love God and not to despise His commandments, as do those who lack effective knowledge of Him. Moreover, God withholds some of the mysteries from us, so that we may long for them and not be quickly sated, as was Adam, whom the enemy caught off his guard and led into his own base ways.</p>
      <p> This, then, is the position of. those who have acquired the virtues. Those who lack knowledge, on the other hand. God alarms with trials and temptations so that they will refrain from sin: at the same time He: encourages them by bestowing on them bodily blessings so as to keep them from despair. God in His unbounded goodness does this at all times so that He may save all men and free them from the snares of the devil, either by conferring on them or else by withholding from them His favors and knowledge. According to the gratitude of each He bestows His gifts and divine thoughts. Similarly, in accordance with the propensity of each reader and with what is to his profit, God</p>
      <p> [V3] 276</p>

      <p> Book 11</p>
      <p> Twenty-Four Discourses</p>
      <p> XXIV Conscious Awareness in the Heart</p>
      <p> either conceals the meaning of Holy Scripture or allows it to be known.</p>
      <p> The aim of the teachers of secular wisdom was different, for each was eager to defeat the other and to appear wiser; hence they did not discover Christ, nor do those who emulate them, in spite of all their efforts. For, as St John Klimakos says, God reveals Himself, not in response to our exertions, but in response to the humility and simplicity that come through faith, that is, through the contemplation of the Scriptures and of created beings. On this account the Lord said, 'How can you have faith when you receive honor from one another, and do not seek the honor that comes from the only God?" (John 5:44). This is that great faith which makes it possible for us to put all our cares into the hands of God. The apostle calls it the foundation (cf. Heb. 6:1), St John Klimakos, the mother of stillness, and St Isaac, the faith of contemplation and the gateway of the mysteries. He who possesses this faith is completely free from worry and anxiety, as were all the saints.</p>
      <p> The saints, like the righteous men of old, even had names to suit them. Peter's name, that comes from the Greek word for 'rock', indicates his firmness; Paul's name, that comes from the Greek word for 'rest', refers to the 'rest' he found in Christ; James is called the 'tripper up', because he tripped up the devil; and Stephen - from the Greek word for 'crown' - is named from the unfading crown he won; Athanasios means 'deathless' in Greek; Basil means 'kingdom"; Gregory signifies 'vigilance',' for he was vigilant in wisdom and theology; Chrysostom, meaning 'golden-mouthed' in Greek, is so named from his rich style and admirable grace in speaking; and Isaac means forgiveness.</p>
      <p> In short, in both the Old and the New Testament, the names given are appropriate. Thus Adam was named from the four Cardinal points; for the four letters of his name are the initial letters of the Greek words for East, West, North and South. Man, in the Syrian language, was denoted by the word for "fire", because of the similitude of his nature to that of fire. For the whole of humanity is descended from one man, just as from a single lamp one can light as many others as one wishes without the first suffering any loss. But, after the</p>

      <p> confusion of the tongues (cf. Gen. 11:1 -9), in one language the name 'man' is derived from the forgetfulness which man incurred another from his other characteristics. The Greek language derives its word for 'man' from the fact that he looks upward; yet his chief natural quality is his intelligence: it is for this reason that he is called an intelligent being, since he alone has this quality. As regards the other qualities from which he is named, there are many other created beings with which he shares them.</p>
      <p> Hence we ought to abandon all other things and as intelligent beings cleave to the intelligence, offering with the intelligence intelligible worship to the divine Intelligence. Then we will be found worthy to receive from Him in this</p>
      <p> present age, in return for human words, the divine words of the Holy Spirit. For it is said of God that He 'gives prayer to him who prays' (1 Sam. 2:9. LXX); and indeed to one who truly prays the prayer of the body God gives the prayer of the intellect; and to one who diligently cultivates the prayer of the intellect, God gives the imageless and formless prayer that comes from the pure fear of Him. Again, to one who practices this prayer effectively. God grants the contemplation of created beings. Once this is attained-once the intellect has freed itself from all things and, not content with hearing about God at second hand, devotes itself to Him in action and thought - God permits it to be seized in rapture, conferring on it the gift of true' theology and the blessings of the age to be.</p>
      <p> Thus spiritual knowledge is good if it fills its possessor with shame and so leads him involuntarily towards humility, making him think that he possesses such knowledge unworthily; indeed, according to St John Klimakos, in his humility he even rejects it as harmful, God-given though it may be. Yet how disastrous if it affects him as it affected that monk who was torn apart by the triple-teethed prongs of the demons! He was so greatly respected and loved that all mourned his death and thought it a great loss. Yet he was a victim of hidden pride; and the person who has told us about him heard from on high the words, 'Allow him no rest, for never for a single moment did he give rest to Me.' Alas, someone whom everyone called a saint, and through whose prayers many hoped to be saved from a host of trials and temptations, came to such an end because he thought so</p>
      <p> [V3] 278</p>
      <p> St Peter of Damaskos</p>

      <p> Twenty-Four Discourses</p>

      <p> highly of himself. And it is obvious that the reason was his pride. For had it been some other sin, he would not have teen able to take everyone in or to commit it continuously. It is true that, had it been heresy, he would have continually angered God through his willful blasphemy; but heresy does not remain concealed for ever. Through God's providence it is revealed, so that he who holds it may recant, provided he is willing to; if he is not, then it is revealed in order to safeguard other people.</p>
      <p> Thus it is self-satisfied haughtiness alone that can escape the notice of everyone. It all but escapes the notice even of its victim, unless he is permitted to fall into temptations which put his soul to the test and allow him to recognize his own weakness and ignorance. Thus not even for a single moment was the Holy Spirit given rest in the hapless soul of that monk, since he was always preoccupied with the thought of his own excellence and rejoiced in this thought as though it were some lofty achievement. For this reason he was filled with darkness, as are the demons. Moreover, in order to conceal his fault, he nourished this single passion instead of all the others. And this was sufficient for the demons since, as St John Klimakos says, this single passion is capable of taking the place of the other vices.</p>
      <p> I am not here recording something that I discovered with my own understanding and discrimination, but I write what I have learnt from the saint who was my spiritual father. He also told me of an occasion on which St Antony the Great ordered St Paul the Simple to cast the demon out of a certain girl. St Paul did not at once prostrate himself and obey, but made objections, asking St Antony why he did not cast the demon out himself. It was only after St Antony told him that he was otherwise occupied that St Paul finally obeyed. On account of Paul's procrastination, said my spiritual father, the demon did not obey at once, but only went out of the girl after Paul had struggled for a long time. That things are in fact like this can be believed not only on the testimony of the holy elder, but also from the washing of the disciples' feet in the Bible (cf John 13:6-8), as well as from the account of Moses' argument with the Lord (cf. Exod. 4:10), and from the story of the prophet who asked someone to strike him (cf. 1 Kgs. 20:35-42).</p>
      <p> [V3] 279</p>
      <p> St Peter of Damaskos</p>
      <p> Book 11</p>
      <p> Twenty-Four Discourses</p>
      <p> XXIV Conscious Awareness in the Heart</p>
      <p> Because this latter story incapable of a spiritual interpretation which has not been given elsewhere, I will recount it here. A certain king ruled his kingdom so tyrannically that God, in His love for mankind, could not endure this tyranny and commanded his prophet to go and rebuke that king. The prophet, however, knew the king's cruelty and did not wish simply to go to hmi, lest seeing him from afar and surmising the reason for which he had come, the king would drive him away and thus prevent him from carrying out his task; or lest, if he was given audience and began by saying, "My God has sent me here because of your cruelty", the king would not pay attention to what was said. Instead he devised a plan whereby he would be struck by somebody and then go, covered with blood, as if he were lodging a complaint; in this way he would deceive the king and force him to listen to what he had to say.</p>
      <p> As the prophet was going along he came upon someone at the roadside who had an axe, and he said to him, 'Thus says the Lord, take your axe and strike my head.' But the other, being a devout man, said, "Certainly not; I am a man of God and will not lay a hand on the Lord's anointed.' Then the prophet said, 'Thus says the Lord: as you did not obey the voice of the Lord, let a lion come from the desert and devour you.' This was not done in anger - God forbid! It happened for the benefit of all. This righteous man deserved not to die in an ordinary fashion like other men, but to be devoured by a wild beast in accordance with God's word and so to receive a crown of glory because of his bitter death. The  Gerontikori  records a similar story. Four priests made a pact and prayed that, when they had fallen asleep in Christ, their servant should be eaten by a lion because of his unchastity. But the Lord did not hear them, and chose rather to listen to the hesychast who was praying for the servant so that the lion would not touch him.</p>
      <p> To return to the prophet. He then found another man, who was obedient, and he said to him, 'Thus says the Lord: lift your axe and strike my head.' This man, when he heard the words, 'Thus says the Lord', without hesitation</p>
      <p> struck the head of the prophet with his axe, and the prophet said to him, in words similar to those used by Moses when he spoke to the children of Levi, 'The blessing of the Lord be upon you, for you have listened to the voice of the Lord' (cf Exod. 32:29).</p>
      <p> [V3] 280</p>

      <p> Book 11</p>
      <p> Twenty-Four Discourses</p>
      <p> XXIV Conscious Awareness in the Heart</p>
      <p> Thus the first man, in his great devoutness, respected the prophet and did not obey him, like Peter at  the  washing of the feet (cf John 13:8); while the other obeyed without further thought, as the sons of Levi were obedient to Moses when they slew then-brethren (cf. Exod. 32:26-29).</p>
      <p> Judging by outward appearances, he who obeys the will of God does the better thing, for he obeys the supranatural command of the Lord of nature, which he regards as wiser and more righteous than natural knowledge; whereas he who disobeys does a lesser thing, in that he regards his own opinion about what is right as more righteous than the word of God. But if we look deeper, things turn out to be different. What matters is the motive behind the obedience or disobedience; and so he whose motive is to do God's will has chosen the better path. In the present case, to all appearances God seems to be angry with the man who is disobedient and to bless the man who is obedient. But in reality it is not so, as has been said already: from the viewpoint of natural contemplation both were equally good, since the motive of both was to do God's will.</p>
      <p> Then the prophet went to the king and standing before him said, 'Give me justice, 0 king! For as I was coming someone met me on the road and struck my head." And the king, seeing the wound and the blood, became angry in his usual way, but not with the prophet; and, thinking that he was condemning someone else, and not himself, he denounced with extreme severity the man who had wounded the prophet. Then the prophet, having achieved what he wanted, said, "You have spoken well, 0 king, for thus says the Lord: I shall surely tear this kingdom from your hands and from your seed, for it is you that have done these things.' Thus the prophet delivered his message as he wished, skillfully compelling the king to pay attention to what he said. He then departed, praising God.</p>
      <p> Such, then, were the souls of the prophets. They loved God and, because of their knowledge of God, they were eager to suffer for the sake of His will. This is natural; for he who is familiar with a certain path or a certain skill pursues it readily and easily, with assurance explaining to others the direction of the path or the secrets and finer points of the craft; and he often does this even though he is young in years and lacks formal training, while those to whom he is explaining things may be advanced in years and wise in other matters. For the prophets, apostles and martyrs did not gain their knowledge of God</p>
      <p> St Peter of Damaskos</p>
      <p> Book 11</p>
      <p> Twenty-Four Discourses</p>

      <p> and their wisdom at second hand, as we have gained ours. On the contrary, they poured out their blood and received the Spirit, exemplifying the words of the fathers: 'Spill your blood and receive the Spirit.' Thus the fathers suffered martyrdom, not in an outward sense, but in their conscience: instead of undergoing physical death they showed themselves willing to die, and in this way their intellect proved victorious over all earthly desires and reigns in Christ Jesus our Lord. To Him be glory and dominion, honor and worship, now and always and throughout the ages. Amen.</p>

      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homilies</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> (lOth century) (Volume 3, pp. 282-353)</p>
      <p> Introductory Note</p>
      <p> The Makarian Homilies were attributed in the past to St Makarios the Great of Egypt (c. 300-c. 390). A Coptic monk, priest and spiritual father in the desert of Sketis, he figures prominently in the  Lausiac History  of Palladios^ and in the  Sayings of the Desert Fathers,^  and is commemorated in the Church's calendar on 19 January. But this ascription is open to doubt for many reasons: in particular, the early sources say nothing whatever about any writings by Makarios of Egypt, while the background presupposed by the Homilies is not Egyptian but Syrian. All that can be said with any confidence is that the Homilies are the work of an unknown author, writing probably in Syria or Mesopotamia during the late fourth or the early fifth century.</p>
      <p> There are similarities in language and symbolism, and sometimes also in thought, between the Homilies and Messalianism, an ascetic movement that originated in Syria in the late fourth century and spread rapidly to other parts of the Christian East. Some scholars have even concluded that the Homilies are in reality the Ascetic Book' of the Messalians, and on somewhat slender evidence they attribute them to Symeon of Mesopotamia, one of the leading Messalians. Other specialists, without denying the points of resemblance, argue that they should not be exaggerated. The heretical teachings characteristic of extreme Messalianism are not in fact to be found in the Homilies; when language and symbols associated with the Messalians are employed, they are used in a fundamentally Orthodox way.</p>

      <p> Indeed, the Homilies may continue to be regarded, today as in the past, as an authentic expression of Eastern Christian spirituahty at its best.^</p>
      <p> St Nikodimos and St Makarios included in the  Philokalia,  not the original text of the Homilies - which, while lively, is also repetitive and diffuse - but an eleventh-century adaptation attributed to St Symeon Metaphrastis ('the Translator': not to be confused with St Symeon the New Theologian). Symeon Metaphrastis followed an administrative career in the civil service, rising to the high rank of logothete or chancellor, which he held under the Emperors Nikiphoros II Phokas (963-9), John I Tzimiskis (969-76) and Basil II (976-1025). It is thought that he became a monk at the end of his life, and he is commemorated on 9 November. Probably he is to be identified with the chronicler Symeon Magistros. A voluminous writer, he is chiefly remembered for his edition  of \he Menologion or  Lives of the Saints.  He is also probably the author of the prayers for use before and after communion, often ascribed to his namesake Symeon the New Theologian. The Greek title in the  Philokalia  states that Symeon has paraphrased the main group of Fifty Homilies (known as collection II),' but in reality most of the material comes from another group of Twenty-Six Homilies (collection IV).^</p>
      <p> In his selection'' St Symeon Metaphrastis has embodied the master- themes that dominate the Makarian Homilies: the constant conflict or 'unseen warfare' (§ 146) in the depths of the human heart between grace and Satan, between the Holy Spirit and the spirit of evil; the 'co-operation' or  synergeia  (§41) between divine grace and human free will; the need for direct personal experience, for a 'full and conscious assurance' (§ 106) of the indwelling presence of the</p>

      <p> Holy Spirit - a theme taken up and developed by St Symeon the New Theologian. Much is said about the resurrection glory of the human body at the last day (§§61-3, 140-1), but it is also insisted that the saints experience here and now a genuine foretaste of the glory of the age to come: the final resurrection is simply the outward and bodily manifestation of what is already hidden during this present life in the souls of the righteous. The passages on the vision of divine light (§§137-9) anticipate the teaching of St Gregory Palamas and the fourteenth-century Hesychasts.</p>
      <p> While the Makarian Homilies do not underestimate the need for 'labour and sweat of the brow' (§51), what chiefly distinguishes them is their sense of communion with the Holy Spirit, and of the love and joy that He imparts. With their message of encouragement, their vigorous style and simple illustrations, it is not surprising that they should often be given as reading to novices at their first entry to the monastery.</p>

      <p> 1.  We receive salvation by grace and as a divine gift of the Spirit. But to attain the full measure of virtue we need also to possess faith and love, and to struggle to exercise our free will with integrity. In this manner we inherit eternal life as a consequence of both grace and justice. We do not reach the final stage of spiritual maturity through divine power and grace alone, without ourselves making any effort; but neither on the other hand do we attain the final measure of freedom and purity as a result of our own diligence and strength alone, apart from any divine assistance. If the Lord does not build the house, it is said, and protect the city, in vain does the watchman keep awake, and in vain do the laborer and the builder work (cf. Ps. 127:1 -4).</p>
      <p> 2.   What is the will of God that St Paul urges and invites each of us to attain (cf. 1 Thess. 4:3)? It is total cleansing from sin, freedom from the shameful passions and the acquisition of the highest virtue. In other words, it is the purification and sanctification of the heart that comes about through fully experienced and conscious participation in the perfect and divine Spirit. 'Blessed are the pure in heart," it is said, 'for they shall see God' (Matt. 5:8); and again: 'Become perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matt. 5:48). And the psalmist says: 'Let my heart be unerring in Thy statutes, so that I am not ashamed" (Ps. 119:80); and again: 'When I pay attention to all Thy commandments, then I will not be ashamed" (Ps. 119:6). And to the person that asked, "Who will ascend the Lord's hill, or who will stand in His holy place?" The psalmist replied: "He that has clean hands and a pure heart" (Ps. 24:3-4), that is to say, he who has completely destroyed sin in act and thought.</p>
      <p> 3.  The Holy Spirit, knowing that the unseen and secret passions are hard to get rid of - for they are as it were rooted in the soul - shows us through the psalmist how we can purify ourselves from</p>

      <p> them. 'Cleanse me from my secret faults', writes the psalmist (Ps. 19:12), as though to say that through much prayer and faith, and by turning completely to God, we are able, with the help of the Spirit, to conquer them. But this is on condition that we too strive against them and keep strict watch over our heart (cf Prov. 4:23).</p>
      <p> 4.  Moses indicates figuratively that the soul should not be divided in will between good and evil, but should pursue the good alone; and that it must cultivate not the dual fruits of virtue and vice but those of virtue only. For he says: 'Do not yoke together on your threshing floor animals of a different species, such as ox and ass; but yoke together animals of the same species and so thresh your com' (cf. Deut. 22:10). This is to say, do not let virtue and vice work together on the threshing floor of your heart, but let virtue alone work there. Again he says: 'Do not weave flax into a woolen garment, or wool into a linen garment" (cf. Deut. 22:11); and: "Do not cultivate two kinds of fruit together on the same patch of your land' (cf. Deut. 22:9). Similarly, you are not to mate an animal of one species with an animal of another species, but to mate like with like. All this is a concealed way of saying that you must not cultivate virtue and vice together in yourself, but you must devote yourself singlemindedly to producing the fruits of virtue; and you must not share your soul with two spirits - the Spirit of God and the spirit of the world -but you must give it solely to the Spirit of God and must reap only the fruits of the Spirit. It is for this reason that the psalmist writes: 'I have prospered in all Thy commandments; I hate every false way' (Ps. 119:128).</p>
      <p> 5.   The virgin soul that desires to be united to God must keep itself pure not only from overt sins like unchastity, murder, theft, gluttony, backbiting, falsity, avarice, greed and so on; but to an even greater degree it must keep itself pure from sins that are hidden, such as desire, self-esteem, love of popularity, hypocrisy, love of power, wiliness, malice, hatred, unbelief, envy, self-love, affectation and other things of this kind. According to Scripture, these concealed sins of the soul are just as pernicious as the overt sins. "The Lord has scattered the bones of those who seek to please men', it says (Ps. 53:5. LXX); and: The Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man' (Ps. 5:6), thus making it clear that deceitfulness is just as abhorrent to God as murder. Again, it numbers among the "workers of iniquity' those who 'speak peace to their neighbor but have evil in their hearts' (Ps. 28: 3),</p>
      <p> [V3] 287</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>

      <p> and elsewhere it speaks of those who commit lawless acts in their hearts (cf. Ps. 58:2). It also says: 'Woe to you, when men speak well of you' (Luke 6:26) - that is to say, when you want to hear people say good things about you and when you hang upon their glory and praise. It is true that those who do good cannot escape notice altogether. Indeed, the Lord Himself says: 'Let your light shine before men' (Matt. 5:16), though here it is understood that we do good for the glory of God and not for our own glory or because we desire men's praise. If this is not the case, then we are lacking in faith, as the Lord makes clear when He says: 'How can you have faith when you receive honor from one another, and do not seek the honor that comes from the only God?' (John 5:44). St Paul bids us to do everything, even to eat and to drink, for the glory of God; "for." he says, 'whether you eat or drink, or do anything else, do it for the glory of God" (1 Cor. 10:31). And St John equates hatred with murder when he says: 'Whoever hates his brother is a murderer' (1 John 3:15).</p>
      <p> 6.  'Love bears with all things, patiently accepts all things; love never fails' (1 Cor. 13:7-8). This phrase 'never fails' makes it clear that, unless they have been granted total deliverance from the passions through the most complete and active love of the Spirit, even those who have received spiritual gifts are still liable to falter: they are still in danger, and must struggle in fear against the attacks launched on them by the spirits of evil. St Paul shows that not to be in danger of falling or liable to passion is such a lofty state that the tongues of angels, prophecy, all knowledge and gifts of healing are as nothing compared to it (cf. 1 Cor. 13:1-8).</p>
      <p> 7.  St Paul has here indicated the goal of perfection so that everyone, realizing his poverty in the face of such richness, may long for it intensely and may strive forward along the spiritual path until he attains it. As has been said: 'Run, that you may reach your goal" (1 Cor. 9:24).</p>
      <p> 8.  To deny oneself (cf. Matt. 16:24) is to be ready to give up everything for the brethren's sake and not to follow one's own will in anything, or to possess anything except one's own clothes. He who attains this state, and is thus freed from all things, joyfully does only what he is asked to do. He regards all the brethren, and especially the superiors and those appointed to bear the burdens of the monastery, as lords and masters for Christ's sake. In this way he obeys Christ who</p>

      <p> said: 'He among you who wants to be first and pre-eminent, let him be the last of all and the servant and slave of air(cf Mark 9:35), not inviting any glory, honor or praise from the brethren for his service and conduct. He serves the brethren with complete goodwill, with love and simplicity, not with outward show and with an eye to gaining popularity, but regarding himself as a debtor in everything.</p>
      <p> 9. The superiors of the community, who shoulder a great burden, must fight the crafty designs of evil with the weapon of humility, lest because of the authority they exercise over their subordinate brethren they grow proud and so act to their own detriment rather than to their profit. They should be like compassionate fathers, in the name of God giving themselves bodily and spiritually to the service of the community, keeping watch over the brethren and</p>
      <p> constantly looking after them as children of God. Outwardly they should not disown the rank of superior, as for instance in giving orders or advice to the more experienced monks, or in punishing or rebuking someone when necessary, and in encouraging where it is appropriate; otherwise, on the grounds that they are being humble or gentle, they will introduce confusion into the monastery through not preserving the due order of superiors and subordinates. But inwardly, in their own minds, they should regard themselves as unworthy servants of all their brethren, and as teachers entrusted with the Lord's children; and with unreserved goodwill and fear of God they should do all they can to make each of the brethren apt for every good work, knowing that the reward they will receive from God for such labor will be great and inalienable.</p>
      <p> 10.  There are times when servants whose task it is to instruct the young do not hesitate in all charity to beat them for the sake of discipline or good behavior, even if those they punish are the children of their own masters. Similarly, superiors should punish those of the brethren in need of discipline, yet not in anger or haughtiness, or for personal revenge, but with compassion and with a view to their reform and spiritual profit.</p>
      <p> 11.   He who wants to be stamped with the virtues should pursue before everything else and at all times fear of God and holy love, the first and greatest of the commandments (cf. Matt. 22:38). Let him continually beseech the Lord to send this love into his heart, and thus let him advance and grow, augmenting it by grace day by day through the ceaseless and unbroken remembrance of God. Through diligence</p>

      <p> and effort, concern and struggle he becomes capable of acquiring love for God, given form within him by the grace and bounty of Christ. Through such love the second commandment, love for one's neighbor (cf Matt. 22:39), can easily be attained. Let these two primary commandments take precedence over the others and let him pursue them more than the others. In this way the secondary commandments will follow naturally on the primary. But should he neglect this first and great commandment, the love for God that is formed with divine help from our inner disposition, our clear conscience and our life-giving remembrance of God, then in consequence of this neglect he cannot soundly and purely accomplish the second commandment, that requires simply the outward diligence of service. For the guile of evil, finding the intellect void of the remembrance of God, and of love and longing for Him, will make the divine commandments appear harsh and laborious, kindling in his soul grumbling, resentment and complaints about having to serve the brethren; or else it will deceive him with the presumption of self-righteousness, filling him with arrogance and making him think that he is of great importance and worthy of esteem, and that he</p>
      <p> has entirely fulfilled the commandments.</p>
      <p> 12.  When a man thinks that he is keeping the commandments perfectly, it is obvious that he is mistaken and that he is breaking one of them, since he judges himself and does not submit to the true judge. But when, in St Paul's words (cf. Rom. 8:16), the Spirit of God testifies along with our spirit, then indeed we are worthy of Christ and are children of God. This is not the case", however, when we justify ourselves merely on the basis of what we ourselves think. It is not the man who commends himself that is to be trusted, but he whom Christ commends (cf. 2 Cor. 10:18). When a man lacks the remembrance and fear of God, it is inevitable that he will long for glory and will seek for praise from those whom he serves. As has already been explained, such a person is called an unbeliever by Christ; for He says: 'How can you have faith when you receive honor from one another, and do not seek the honor that comes from the only God?" (John 5:44).</p>
      <p> 13.  As has been said, love for God can be attained through the intellect's great struggles and labors in holy meditation and in unremitting attention to all that is good. The devil, on the contrary, impedes our intellect, not letting it devote itself to divine love</p>
      <p> [V3] 290</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>

      <p> I</p>
      <p> Spiritual Perfection</p>
      <p> through the remembrance of what is good, but enticing the senses with earthly desires. For the intellect that dwells undistractedly in the love and remembrance of God is the devil's death and, so to say, his noose. Hence it is only through the first commandment, love for God, that genuine love for one's brother can be established, and that true simplicity, gentleness, humility, integrity, goodness, prayer and the whole beautiful crown of the virtues can be perfected. Much struggle is needed, therefore, and much inward and unseen travail, much scrutiny of our thoughts and training of our soul's enfeebled organs of perception, before we can discriminate between good and evil, and strengthen and give fresh life to the afflicted powers of our soul through the diligent striving of our intellect towards God. For by always cleaving to God in this way our intellect will become one spirit with the Lord, as St Paul puts it (cf 1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
      <p> 14. Those aspiring to the state of virtue must strive to fulfill the commandments by sustaining this inward struggle, travail and meditation unceasingly night and day, whether praying or serving, eating or drinking, or doing anything else. In this way, if any good comes about it will be to God's glory and not to their own. The fulfillment of the commandments presents no difficulty or trouble to us when it is facilitated by the love of God and when this love relieves it of all that is burdensome. As has been said, the whole effort of the enemy is directed towards distracting</p>
      <p> the intellect from the remembrance, fear and love of God, and to turning it by means of earthly forms and seductions away from what is truly good towards what appears to be good.</p>
      <p> 15. The patriarch Abraham, when he was receiving Melchisedec, the priest of God, made him an offering from the firstfruits of the earth and so obtained his blessing (cf. Gen. 14:19-20). Through this incident the Spirit indicates that the first and highest elements of our constitution - the intellect, the conscience, the loving power of the soul -must initially be offered to God as a holy sacrifice. The firstfruits and the highest of our true thoughts must be continually devoted to remembrance of Him, engrossed in His love and in unutterable and boundless longing for Him. In this way we can grow and move forward day by day, assisted by divine grace. Then the burden of fulfilling the commandments will appear light to us, and we will carry them out faultlessly and irreproachably, helped by the Lord Himself on account of our faith in Him.</p>

      <p> 16.   Where outward ascetic practice is concerned, which virtue is the most important? The answer to this is that the virtues are linked one to the other, and follow as it were a sacred sequence, one depending on the other. For instance, prayer is linked to love, love to joy, joy to gentleness, gentleness to humility, humility to service, service to hope, hope to faith, faith to obedience, and obedience to simplicity. Similarly, the vices are linked one to another: hatred to anger, anger to pride, pride to self-esteem, self-esteem to unbelief, unbelief to hardheartedness, hardheartedness to negligence, negligence to sluggishness, sluggishness to apathy, apathy to listlessness, hstlessness to lack of endurance, lack of endurance to self-indulgence, and so on with all the other vices.</p>
      <p> 17.  The devil tries to soil and defile every good thing a man would do by intermingling with it his own seeds in the form of self-esteem, presumption, complaint, and other things of this kind, so that what we do is not done for God alone, or with a glad heart. Abel offered a sacrifice to God of the fat and firstlings of his flock, while Cain offered gifts of the fruits of the earth, but not of the firstfruits: and that is why God looked with favor on Abel's sacrifices, but paid no attention to Cain's gifts (cf Gen. 4:3-5). This shows us that it is possible to do something good in the wrong way - that is to say, to do it negligently, or scornfully, or else not for God's sake but for some other purpose; and for this reason it is unacceptable to God.</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> II Prayer</p>
      <p> 18.  The crown of every good endeavor and the highest of achievements is dihgence in prayer. Through it God guiding us and lending a helping hand, we come to acquire the other virtues. It is in prayer that the saints experience communion in the hidden energy of God's holiness and inner union with it, and their intellect itself is brought through unutterable love into the presence of the Lord. "Thou hast given gladness to my heart", wrote the psalmist (Ps. 4:7); and the Lord Himself said that 'the kingdom of heaven is within you' (cf Luke 17:21). And what does the kingdom being within mean except that the heavenly gladness of the Spirit is clearly stamped on the virtuous soul? For already in this life, through active communion in the Spirit, the virtuous soul receives a foretaste and a prelude of the delight, joy and spiritual gladness which the saints will enjoy in the eternal light of Christ's kingdom. This is something that St Paul also affirms: "He consoles us in our afflictions, so that we can console others in every affliction through the consolation with which we ourselves have been consoled by God" (2 Cor. 1:4). And passages in the Psalms likewise hint at this active gladness and consolation of the Spirit, such as: 'My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God' (Ps. 84:2. LXX): and: 'My soul will be filled with marrow and fatness" (Ps. 63:5).</p>
      <p> 19.   Just as the work of prayer is greater than other work, so it demands greater effort and attention from the person ardently devoted to it, lest without him being aware the devil deprives him of it. The greater the good a person has in his care, the greater the attacks the devil launches on him; hence he must keep strict watch, so that fruits of love and humility, simplicity and goodness - and, along with them, fruits of discrimination - may grow daily from the constancy of his prayer. These will make evident his progress and increase in holiness, thus encouraging others to make similar efforts.</p>
      <p> [V3]293</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homilies</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> II Prayer</p>
      <p> 20.  Not only does St Paul instruct us to pray without ceasing and to persist in prayer (cf. 1 Thess. 5:17; Rom. 12:12), but so also does the Lord when He says that God will vindicate those who cry out to Him day and night (cf Luke 18:7) and counsels us to 'watch and pray" (Matt. 26 : 41). We must therefore pray always and not lose heart</p>
      <p> (cf. Luke 18:1). To put things more succinctly: he who persists in prayer has to struggle greatly and exert himself relentlessly if he is to overcome the many obstacles with which the devil tries to impede his diligence - obstacles such as sleep, listlessness, physical torpor, distraction of thought, confusion of intellect, debility, and so on, not to mention afflictions, and also the attacks of the evil spirits that violently fight against us, opposing us and trying to prevent the soul from approaching God when it truly and ceaselessly seeks Him.</p>
      <p> 21.  He who cultivates prayer has to fight with all diligence and watchfulness, all endurance, all struggle of soul and toil of body, so that he does not become sluggish and surrender himself to distraction of thought, to excessive sleep, to listlessness, debility and confusion, or defile himself with turbulent and indecent suggestions, yielding his mind to things of this kind, satisfied merely with standing or kneeling for a long time, while his intellect wanders far away. For unless a person has been trained in strict vigilance, so that when attacked by a flood of useless thoughts he tests and sifts them all, yearning always for the Lord, he is readily seduced in many unseen ways by the devil. Moreover, those not yet capable of persisting in prayer can easily grow arrogant, thus allowing the machinations of evil to destroy the good work in which they are engaged and making a present of it to the devil.</p>
      <p> 22.   Unless humility and love, simplicity and goodness regulate our prayer, this prayer - or, rather, this pretence of prayer - cannot profit us at all. And this applies not only to prayer, but to every labor and hardship undertaken for the sake of virtue, whether this be virginity, fasting, vigil, psalmody, service or any other work. If we do not see in ourselves the fruits of love, peace, joy, simplicity, humility, gentleness, guilelessness, faith, forbearance and kindliness, then we endure our hardship to no purpose. We accept the hardships in order to reap the fruits. If the fruits of love are not in us, our labor is useless. In such a case we differ in nothing from the five foolish virgins: because their hearts were not filled here and now, in this present life, with spiritual oil - that is to say, with the energy of the</p>
      <p> [V3] 294</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> II Prayer</p>
      <p> Spirit active in the virtues of which we have spoken - they were called fools and were abjectly excluded from the royal bridechamber, not enjoying any reward for their efforts to preserve their virginity (cf Matt. 25:1-13). When we cultivate a vineyard, the whole of our attention and labor is given in the expectation of the vintage; if there is no vintage, all our work is to no purpose. Similarly, if through the activity of the Spirit we do not perceive within ourselves the fruits of love, peace, joy and the other qualities mentioned by St Paul (cf. Gal. 5:22), and cannot affirm this with all assurance and spiritual awareness, then our labor for the sake of virginity, prayer, psalmody, fasting and vigil is useless. For, as we said, our labors and hardships of soul and body should be undertaken in expectation of the spiritual harvest; and where the virtues are concerned, the harvest consists of spiritual enjoyment and incorruptible pleasure secretly made active by the Spirit in faithful and humble hearts. Thus the labors and hardships</p>
      <p> must be regarded as labors and hardships and the fruits as fruits. Should someone through lack of spiritual knowledge think that his work and hardship are fruits of the Spirit, he should realize that he is deluding himself, and in this way depriving himself of the truly great fruits of the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 23.   The person who has surrendered himself entirely to sin indulges with enjoyment and pleasure in unnatural and shameful passions - licentiousness, unchastity, greed, hatred, guile and other forms of vice - as though they were natural. The genuine and perfected Christian, on the other hand, with great enjoyment and spiritual pleasure participates effortlessly and without impediment in all the virtues and all the supranatural fruits of the Spirit - love, peace, patient endurance, faith, humility and the entire truly golden galaxy of virtue - as though they were natural. He does not fight any longer against the passions of evil, for he has been totally set free of them by the Lord; while from the blessed Spirit he has received Christ's perfect peace and joy in his heart. Of such a man it may be said that he cleaves to the Lord and has become one spirit with Him (cf. 1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
      <p> 24.  Those who because of their spiritual immaturity cannot yet commit themselves entirely to the work of prayer should undertake to serve the brethren with reverence, faith and devout fear. They should do this because they regard such service as a divine commandment and a spiritual task; they should not expect reward.</p>
      <p> [V3]295</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> II Prayer</p>
      <p> honor or thanks from men, and they should shun all complaint, haughtiness, negligence or sluggishness. In this way they will not soil and corrupt this blessed work, but through their reverence, fear and joy will make it acceptable to God.</p>
      <p> 25.   The Lord descended to the human level with such love, goodness and divine compassion for us, that He took it upon Himself not to overlook the reward of any good work, but to lead us step by step from the small to the great virtues, so that not even a cup of cold water should go unrequited. For He said: "If anyone gives even a cup of cold water to someone simply in the name of a disciple, I tell you truly that he will not go unrewarded" (cf Matt. 10:42); and elsewhere: "Whatever you did to one of these, you did to Me" (cf. Matt. 25:40). Only the action must be done in the name of God, not for the sake of receiving honor from men: the Lord said, "simply in the name of a disciple", that is to say, in the fear and love of Christ. Those who do good with ostentation are rebuked categorically by the Lord: 'I tell you truly, they have received their reward" (Matt. 6:2).</p>
      <p> 26.   Simplicity before others, guilelessness, mutual love, joy and humility of every kind, must be laid down as the foundation of the community. Otherwise, disparaging others or grumbling about them, we make our labor profitless. He who persists ceaselessly in prayer must not disparage the man incapable of doing this, nor must the man who devotes himself to serving the needs of the community complain about those who are dedicated to prayer. For if both the prayers and the service are offered in a spirit of simplicity and love for others, the superabundance of those dedicated to prayer will make up for the insufficiency of those who serve, and  vice versa.  In this way the equality</p>
      <p> that St Paul commends is maintained (of. 2 Cor. 8:14): he who has much does not have to excess and he who has little has no lack (cf. Exod. 16:18).</p>
      <p> 27.  God's will is done on earth as in heaven when, in the way indicated, we do not disparage one another, and when not only are we without jealousy but we are united one to another in simplicity and in mutual love, peace and joy, and regard our brother's progress as our own and his failure as our loss.</p>
      <p> 28.  He who is sluggish in prayer, and slothful and negligent in serving his brethren and in performing other holy tasks, is explicitly called an idler by the apostle, and condemned as unworthy even of his bread. For St Paul writes that the idler is not to have any food (cf. 2 Thess. 3:10);</p>
      <p> [V3] 296</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homihes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> II Prayer</p>
      <p> and elsewhere it is said that God hates idlers, that the idle man cannot be trusted, and that idleness has taught great evil (cf. Ecclus. 33:27). Thus each of us should bear the fruit of some action performed in God's name, even if he has employed himself diligently in but one good work. Otherwise he will be totally barren, and without any share in eternal blessings.</p>
      <p> 29.  When people say that it is impossible to attain perfection, to be once and for all free from the passions, or to participate fully in the Holy Spirit, we should cite Holy Scripture against them, showing them that they are ignorant and speak falsely and dangerously. For the Lord said: 'Become perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect' (Matt. 5:48), perfection denoting total purity; and: 'I desire these men to be with Me wherever I am, so that they may see My glory' (John 17:24). He also said: "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away' (Matt. 24:35). And St Paul is saying the same as Christ when he writes: '. . . so that we may present every man perfect in Christ" (Col. 1:28); and:". . . until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ' (Eph. 4:13). Thus by aspiring to perfection two of the best things come about, provided we struggle diligently and unceasingly: we seek to attain this perfect measure and growth; and we are not conquered by vanity, but look upon ourselves as petty and mean because we have not yet reached our goal.</p>
      <p> 30.   Those who deny the possibility of perfection inflict the greatest damage on the soul in three ways. First, they manifestly disbelieve the inspired Scriptures. Then, because they do not make the greatest and fullest goal of Christianity their own, and so do not aspire to attain it, they can have no longing and diligence, no hunger and thirst for righteousness (cf Matt. 5:6); on the contrary, content with outward show and behavior and with minor accomplishments of this kind, they abandon that blessed expectation together with the pursuit of perfection and of the total purification of the passions. Third, thinking they have reached the goal when they have acquired a few</p>
      <p> virtues, and not pressing on to the true goal, not only are they incapable of having any humility, poverty and contrition of heart but, justifying themselves on the grounds that they have already arrived, they make no efforts to progress and grow day by day.</p>
      <p> 31. People who think it is impossible to attain through the Spirit [V3] 297</p>
      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the HomiHes</p>
      <p> of St Makarios of Egypt</p>
      <p> II Prayer</p>
      <p> the 'new creation" of the pure heart (cf 2 Cor. 5:17) are rightly and explicitly likened by the apostle to those who, because of their unbelief, were found unworthy of entering the promised land and whose bodies on that account 'were left lying in the desert' (Heb. 3:17). What is here outwardly described as the promised land signifies inwardly that deliverance from the passions which the apostle regards as the goal of every commandment. This is the true promised land, and for its sake these figurative teachings have been handed down. In order to protect his disciples from yielding to unbelief the apostle says to them: 'Make sure, my brethren, that no one among you has an evil heart of unbelief, turning away from the living God" (Heb. 3:12). By 'turning away" he means not the denial of God but disbelief in His promises. Interpreting the events of Jewish history allegorically and indicating their true meaning, he says: "For some, when they heard, were rebellious, though not all of those who were brought out of Egypt by Moses. And with whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who had sinned, whose bodies were left lying in the desert? And to whom did He vow that they would not enter into His rest unless it was to those who refused to believe? We see, then, that it was because of their unbelief that they could not enter" (Heb. 3:16-19). And he continues: "Let us be fearful, then: although the promise of entering into His rest still holds good, some of you may be excluded from it. For we have heard the divine message, as they did; but the message that they heard did not profit them, since it was not accompanied by faith on their part. We, however, who have faith do enter into God's rest" (Heb. 4:1-3). Shortly after this he draws the same conclusion: 'Let us strive therefore to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall through copying this example of unbelief (Heb. 4:11). For Christians what true rest is there other than deliverance from the sinful passions and the fullest active indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the purified heart? And the apostle again impels his readers towards this by referring to faith: 'Let us then draw near with a true heart and in the full assurance of faith, our hearts cleansed of an evil conscience" (Heb. 10:22). And again: "How much more will the blood of Jesus purge our conscience of dead works, so that we may serve the living and true God" (cf. Heb. 9:14). Because of the measureless blessings promised by God to men in these words, we should dedicate ourselves as grateful servants and regard what is promised as true and</p>

      <p> St Symeon Metaphrastis</p>
      <p> Paraphrase of the Homilies of</p>

      <p> II Prayer</p>
      <p> certain. In this way, even if through sluggishness or debility of resolution we do not give ourselves once for all to our Maker, or if we do not strive to achieve the greatest and most perfect measure of virtue, none the less through an upright and undistorted will and a sound faith we may attain some degree of mercy.</p>
      <p> 32. Prayer rightly combined with understanding is superior to every virtue and commandment. The Lord Himself testifies to this. For in the house of Martha and Mary He contrasted Martha, who was engaged in looking after Him, with Mary, who sat at His feet joyfully drinking the ambrosia of His divine words. When Martha complained and appealed to Christ, He made clear to her what takes precedence, saying: 'Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things; one thing alone is needful: Mary has chosen what is best, and it cannot be taken away from her' (Luke 10:41-42). He said this not in order to disparage acts of service, but so as to distinguish clearly what is higher from what is lower. For how could He not give His sanction to service when He Himself performed such service in washing His disciples' feet, and was so far from discountenancing it that He bade His disciples to behave in the same way towards each other (cf John 13:4-16)? Moreover, the apostles themselves, when they were oppressed by serving at table, also singled out prayer and understanding as the higher form of work. 'It is not right', they said, 'for us to abandon the word of God in order to serve at table. Let us appoint chosen men, full of the Holy Spirit, for this service; we will devote ourselves to the ministry of the Logos and to prayer' (cf. Acts 6:2-4). In this way they put first things before secondary things, although they recognized that both spring from the same blessed root.</p>

      <p> III Patient Endurance and Discrimination</p>
      <p> 33. The signs that accompany those who wish to submit to the Logos of God and who bring forth good fruit are: sighing, weeping, sorrow, stillness, shaking of the head, prayer, silence, persistence, bitter grief, tribulation of heart arising from religious devotion. In addition, their actions manifest vigilance, fasting, self-control, gentleness, forbearance, unceasing prayer, study of the divine Scriptures, faith, humilit)', brotherly affection, submission, rigorous toil, hardship, love, kindliness, courtesy and-the sum of all-light, which is the Lord. The signs that accompany those who are not producing the fruit of life are listlessness, day-dreaming, curiosity, lack of attention.</p>
      <p> grumbling, instability; and in their actions they manifest gluttony, anger, wrath, back-biting, conceit, untimely talk, unbelief, disorderliness, forgetful-ness, unrest, sordid greed, avarice, envy, factiousness, contempt, garrulity, senseless laughter, willfulness and - the sum of all - darkness, which is Satan.</p>
      <p> 34.  In accordance with divine providence, the devil was not sent at once to the Gehenna assigned to him, but his sentence was postponed in order to let him test and try men's free will. In this way, he unintentionally fosters greater maturity and righteousness in the saints by promoting their patient endurance, and so is the cause of their greater glory; and, at the same time, through his malevolence and his scheming against the saints he justifies more fully his own punishment. In this way, too, sin becomes more utterly sinful, as St Paul puts it (cf. Rom. 7:13).</p>
      <p> 35.   By deceiving Adam and in this way gaining mastery over him, the devil deprived him of his authority and proclaimed himself lord of this world. For in the beginning God appointed man to be the lord of this world and the master of visible things (cf. Gen. 1:26). On this account, fire had no power over him, water did not drown him, no animal injured him, poisonous snakes had no effect on him. But once he</p>

      <p> III Patient Endurance and Discrimination</p>
      <p> had been deceived, he surrendered his lordship to his deceiver. For this reason sorcerers and magicians, through the use of diabolic energy, become with God's permission miracle-workers: they have power over poisonous snakes and they challenge fire and water, as was exemplified by the followers of Jannes and Jambres who opposed Moses (cf. Exod. chs. 7-8; 2 Tim. 3:8), and by the Simon who resisted the chief apostle, Peter (cf. Acts 8:18-24).</p>
      <p> 36.  When the devil beheld Adam's original glory shining from the face of Moses (cf. Exod. 34 : 30-31), he was cut to the quick since he saw in this a sign of the coming destruction of his kingdom. St Paul's words, 'Death held sway from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned" (Rom. 5:14), may be taken to refer to this. In my opinion the glorified face of Moses preserved the type and example of the first man created by the hands of God. It is for this reason that when death - that is to say, the devil, who is the cause of death - saw it, he then guessed that his kingdom would fall, as in fact happened with the advent of the Lord. Genuine Christians are therefore encompassed by this glory even in this present life; and inwardly they have annulled death, that is to say, the shameful passions, which cannot operate within them, since the glory of the Holy Spirit shines fully and consciously in their souls. In the resurrection, moreover, death is totally abolished.</p>
      <p> 37.  When, using the woman as his accomplice, the devil deceived Adam, he divested him of the glory that enveloped him. Thus Adam found himself naked and perceived his disfigurement, of which he had been unaware</p>
      <p> until that moment since he had dehghted his mind with celestial beauty. After his transgression, on the other hand, his thoughts became base and material, and the simplicity and goodness of his mind were intertwined with evil worldly concerns. The closing of paradise, and the placing of the cherubim with the burning sword to prevent his entrance (cf. Gen. 3:24), must be regarded as actual events; but they are also realities encountered inwardly by each soul. A veil of darkness-the fire of the worldly spirit-surrounds the heart, preventing the intellect from communing with God, and the soul from praying, believing and loving the Lord as it desires to do. All these things may be learnt from experience by those who truly entrust themselves to the Lord, persist in prayer, and fight zealously against the enemy.</p>

      <p> beginners in the spiritual life. Yet, as has been said, he brings them great glory and added honor because of the afflictions and trials they endure. In this way he helps them to attain the state of perfection, while he prepares even greater and harsher punishment for himself. In short, something most beneficial is brought about through him: as has been said, evil, while intending what is not good, contributes to the good. For, in souls whose intention is sound, even that which appears harmful results in something good. As St Paul says: "All things work together for good to them that love God' (Rom. 8:28).</p>
      <p> 39.  It is on this account that the rod of chastisement was permitted, so that through it, as in a furnace, the vessels might be more rigorously fired; but those unequal to the test, being easily broken, are rejected as faulty, since they cannot endure the heat of the fire. Being a servant and the Lord's creation, the devil tests and afflicts people, not as he thinks fit or desires, but to the extent that his Master allows him. Knowing the exact nature of everything, God permits each person to be tested according to his strength. As St Paul puts it: 'God is to be trusted not to let you be tried beyond your strength, but with the trial He will provide a way out, so that you are able to bear it' (1 Cor. 10:13).</p>
      <p> 40.  As the Lord affirms, the person who seeks and knocks and who never gives up asking will attain what he asks for (cf Matt. 7:8). Only he must have the courage to entreat continually with intellect and tongue, and to cleave to God relentlessly with bodily worship; and he must not entangle himself in worldly things or indulge in evil passions. He who said, 'Whatever you ask for in prayer, believing, you will receive" (Matt. 21:22), is not a liar. Those who say that even if you fulfill all the commandments in the hope of attaining grace in this present life, you will gain nothing, are ignorant and what they say is wrong and contrary to divine Scripture. There is no injustice in God that would make Him fail to fulfill His obligations if we fulfill ours. Only you must see to it that when the time comes</p>
      <p> for your soul to leave your hapless body you are still engaged in spiritual struggle, pressing on, awaiting the promise, persevering, trusting, seeking with discrimination. Do not disbelieve me when I say that you will go forth joyfully, with confidence, and you will be found worthy to see the kingdom of God. Indeed, if your soul is refined through your faith and ardor, you are already in communion with God. The person who looks lustfully at a woman has already committed adultery with her in his heart (cf. Matt. 5:28), and even if he has not sullied his body is regarded as already</p>

      <p> guilty of adultery. Similarly, the person who expels evil from his heart and who cleaves to God with longing, supplication, diligence and love, already enjoys communion with God, and has even now received from God this great gift, that he can persist in prayer diligently and devotedly. If the giving of a cup of cold water does not go unrewarded (cf. Matt. 10:42), how much more will God give what He has promised to those who devote themselves to Him night and day?</p>
      <p> 41.  Those who are troubled by what will happen to them if one day they find themselves full of hatred for their brother, or realize that involuntarily they are in the grip of some other evil passion, should be told that they need to struggle without intermission against the devil and evil thoughts. For where the darkness of the passions and death -that is to say, the will of the flesh - hold sway, it is impossible for some evil fruit not to manifest itself, visibly or invisibly. A bodily wound, even if it only discharges slightly, exudes moisture and festers or is puffy and swells up, until it is totally healed. This is so even when it is being treated and when no remedy is wittingly omitted. But if the festering is neglected it can lead to the corruption of the whole body. In a similar way the soul's passions, even if they receive great attention, will go on smoldering within the soul until with steadfast diligence they are finally cured through the grace and co-operation of Christ. For there is a certain hidden pollution and a strange darkness of the passions that, in spite of man's pure nature, have insinuated themselves into the whole of humanity as a result of Adam's transgression; and they obscure and defile both body and soul. But just as iron when fired and struck is purified, or gold mixed with copper or iron is separated out by fire, so through the most pure Passion of the Savior the soul, fired and struck by the Holy Spirit, is cleansed of every passion and of every sin.</p>
      <p> 42.   Just as many lamps may be lit from the same oil and from a single light, and yet often do not give out an equal radiance, so the gifts that come from different virtues reflect the light of the Holy Spirit in different ways. Or as the many inhabitants of a single city all use bread and water, though some of them are men, some infants, some children, some old people, and there is a great variety and difference among them; or as wheat sown in the same field may bear dissimilar ears of com, though they are all brought to the same threshing-floor and stored in the same</p>
      <p> bam: so it seems to me that in the resurrection of the dead different degrees of glory will be distinguished and recognized among those who are resurrected, depending on the level of virtue they</p>

      <p> have attained and the extent of their participation during this present life in the Holy Spirit that already dwells within them. This is the significance of the phrase, 'Star differs from star in glory" (1 Cor. 15:41).</p>
      <p> 43.   Even if some stars are smaller than others, they all shine with a single light. The image is quite clear; but let us give attention to one thing only: after being bom in the Holy Spirit, to wash away our indwelling sin. Once this birth through the Holy Spirit has taken place, it means that an image of perfection is active within us in an initial form, though it is not yet expressed in terms of power, intellect or courage. Whoever has attained the full measure of mature manhood naturally lays aside childish things (cf 1 Cor. 13:11). That is why St Paul says that speaking in tongues and prophecies will come to an end (cf 1 Cor. 13:8). Just as an adult does not eat foods or use words fitting for a child, but scorns them as unworthy of him, since he has entered another stage of life, so the person who approaches perfection in the evangelic virtues ceases to be an infant with respect to that perfection. To quote St Paul again, 'When I grew up I finished with childish things'(l Cor. 13:11).</p>
      <p> 44.   The person who is bom in the Spirit is in a certain manner perfect, just as we call an infant perfect when all his limbs are sound. But the Lord has not bestowed the grace of the Spirit so that one may fall into sin. Men are themselves the cause of the evils into which they fall: not living in accordance with grace they are taken captive by evil. Man can lapse through his own natural thoughts if he is negligent or inattentive or presumptuous. St Paul himself says: To stop me from growing unduly elated I was given a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan' (2 Cor. 12:7). You see how even those who have attained such great heights as St Paul stand in need of protection. Yet if man did not give the devil the opportunity he would not be forcibly dominated by him. Because of this, his actions are not to be imputed either to Christ or to the devil. But if finally he submits to the grace of the Spirit, he is on the side of Christ. If this is not the case, even though he is bom in the Spirit - that is to say, even though he participates in the Holy Spirit-yet because of his actions he follows the will of Satan. For if it were the Lord or Satan who had forcibly seized hold of him, then he himself would not be the cause of his falling into hell or of his attaining God's kingdom.</p>
      <p> 45.  He who follows the spiritual path must pay great attention to</p>

      <p> III Patient Endurance and Discrimination</p>
      <p> discrimination, since the ability to distinguish between good and evil, and to scrutinize and understand the various tricks through which the devil by means of plausible fantasies leads most people astray, keeps us safe and helps us in every way. If a man wanting to test his wife's virtue comes to her at night disguised as someone else, and she repels him, he will rejoice at this and welcome the assurance it gives. It is exactly the same with us in relation to the attacks of the evil spirits. Even if you repel the heavenly spirits, they will be gladdened by this, and will help you to participate still further in grace: because of this proof of your love for the Lord they will fill you brim-full with spiritual delight. So do not from light-mindedness speedily surrender yourself to the visitations of spirits, even if they are heavenly angels, but be wary, submitting them to the most careful scrutiny. Thus you will welcome the good and repel the evil. In this way you will increase in yourself the workings of grace, which sin, however much it may assume the appearance of the good, cannot altogether simulate. According to St Paul, Satan can even change himself into an angel of light in order to practice his deceptions (cf 2 Cor. 11:14); yet though he may manifest himself in such a glorious manner, he cannot, as we said, produce within us the effects of grace, and so it becomes quite clear that the vision is counterfeit. For the devil cannot bring about love either for God or for one's neighbor, or gentleness, or humility, or joy, or peace, or equilibrium in one's thoughts, or hatred of the world, or spiritual repose, or desire for celestial things; nor can he quell passions and sensual pleasure. These things are clearly the workings of grace. For the fruits of the Spirit are love, joy, peace, and so on (cf. Gal. 5:22), while the devil is most apt and powerful in promoting vanity and haughtiness. You may know from its effect whether the intellectual light shining in your soul is from God or from Satan. Indeed, once it has developed its powers of discrimination, the distinction is immediately clear to the soul itself through intellectual perception. Just as the throat through its sense of taste distinguishes the difference between vinegar and wine, although they look alike, so the soul through its intellectual sense and energy can distinguish the gifts of the Spirit from the fantasies of the devil.</p>
      <p> 46. The soul must watch and anticipate carefully so that it is not even for the twinkling of an eye taken captive by the devil's power. Even if only one part of an animal is caught in a trap, the whole animal is held fast and falls into the hands of the hunters; and the same thing is</p>

      <p> liable to happen to the soul at the hands of its enemies. The psalmist makes this quite clear when he says: 'They prepared a trap for my feet and bowed down my soul' (Ps. 57:6. LXX).</p>
      <p> 47.  He who wants to enter the strong man's house through the narrow gate and to make off with his goods (cf. Matt. 7:14; 12:29) must not surrender to luxury and obesity, but must strengthen himself in the Holy Spirit, having in mind the phrase, 'Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God' (1 Cor. 15:50). But how should he strengthen himself in the Spirit? Here he should heed the words of St Paul, that God's wisdom is regarded as foolishness by men (cf. 1 Cor. 1:23), as well as those of Isaiah, that he had seen the son of man, and His form was despised, and He was forsaken by all the sons of men (cf. Isa. 53:3). Thus he who wants to be a son of God must first humble himself in the same way and be regarded as foolish and despicable, not turning his face aside when spat upon (cf. Isa. 50:6), not pursuing the glory and beauty of this world or anything of this kind, not having anywhere to lay his head (cf Matt. 8:20), vilified, mocked, downtrodden, regarded by all as an object of contempt, attacked invisibly and visibly, yet resisting in his mind. It is then that the Son of God, who said, 'I will dwell and walk among you' (cf. Lev. 26:12), will become manifest in his heart, and he will receive power and strength so that he can tie the strong man up and make off with his goods (cf. Matt. 12:29), and tread upon asp and basilisk (cf. Ps. 91:13. LXX), snakes and scorpions (cf. Luke 10:19).</p>
      <p> 48.  No little struggle is required of us to break through death. Christ says: 'The kingdom of God is within you' (Luke 17:21); but he who fights against us and takes us captive also finds some way of being within us. The soul, therefore, must not rest until it has killed him who takes it prisoner. Then all pain, sorrow and sighing will flee away (cf. Isa. 35:10), because water has sprung up in thirsty earth (cf. Isa. 43:20) and the desert has become full of waters (cf. Isa. 41:18).For He has promised to fill the barren heart with living water, speaking first through the prophet Isaiah, saying: 'I will give water to those who are thirsty and who walk through dry land' (Isa. 44:3. LXX); and then through Himself, with the words: "Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again' (John 4:14).</p>
      <p> 49.  The soul overcome by listlessness is manifestly also possessed by lack of faith. It is on account of this that it lets day after day go by without heeding the Gospels. Not paying attention to the inner</p>

      <p> warfare, it is taken captive by conceit and frequently elated by dreams. Conceit blinds the soul, not letting it perceive its own weakness.</p>
      <p> 50.  As the new-bom child is the image of the fuU-grown man, so the soul is in a certain sense the image of God who created it. The child, on growing up, begins gradually to recognize its father, and when it reaches maturity, they dispose things mutually and equally, father with son and son with father, and the father's wealth is disclosed to the son. Something similar should have happened to the soul. Before the fall, the soul was to have progressed and so to have attained full manhood (cf Eph. 4:13). But through the fall it was plunged into a sea of forgetfulness, into an abyss of delusion, and dwelt within the gates of hell. As if separated from God by a great distance, it could not draw near to its Creator and recognize Him properly. But first through the prophets God called it back, and drew it to knowledge of Himself. Finally, through His own advent on earth. He dispelled the forgetfulness, the delusion; then, breaking through the gates of hell. He entered the deluded soul, giving Himself to it as a model. By means of this model the soul can grow to maturity and attain the perfection of the Spirit. It is therefore for our sakes that the Logos of God is by divine permission tempted by the devil, and then endures vilifications, mockeries, beatings at the hands of savage men, and finally death on the Cross, showing us, as we said, what attitude we must take up towards those who vilify and mock us and bring us to our death. Thus we become as though deaf and dumb before them, not opening our mouth, so that clearly perceiving the subtlety and energy of evil, and as though nailed to the cross, we may call loudly to Him who can deliver us from death (cf. Heb. (5:7) and cleanse us from our secret faults (cf. Ps. 19:12); for "if they do not have dominion over me, then 1 shall be faultless" (Ps. 19:13). When we are faultless we find Him 'who has brought all things into subjection' (Ps. 8:6), and we reign and enjoy repose with Christ. Overpowered through the fall by material and unclean thoughts, the soul became as though witless. As a result, no small effort is needed for it to rise out of materiality and to grasp the subtlety of evil, so that it can commingle with unoriginate Intellect.</p>
      <p> 51.   If you want to return to yourself and to recover your original glory, which you lost through your disobedience, heedlessly paying more attention to the orders and counsel of the devil than to the commandments of God, then you must now have done with him whom you obeyed and turn towards the Lord. But you must know that only</p>

      <p> after much labor and sweat of the brow will you recover your richness. Nor is it to your advantage to attain this blessed state without suffering and great effort, for if you do you will lose what you have received and betray your inheritance to the enemy. Let us each realize, then, what we have lost and repeat the lamentation of the prophet: 'Our inheritance is despoiled by strangers and our house by aliens' (Lam. 5:2), because we disobeyed the commandment and surrendered ourselves to our own desires, delighting in sordid and worldly thoughts. Then our soul was far away from God and we were like fatherless orphans. Thus, if we are concerned for our own soul we must make every effort to purge away evil thoughts and 'all the self-esteem that exalts itself against the knowledge</p>
      <p> of God' (2 Cor. 10:5). And when we have forcibly applied ourselves to keeping God's temple spotless, then He who promised to make His dwelling in it will come to us. Then the soul recovers its inheritance and is privileged to become a temple of God. For, after thus Himself expelling the devil and his army, from henceforth He reigns within us.</p>
      <p> 52.  What the Creator outwardly said to Cain, that he would wander over the earth lamenting and trembling (cf Gen. 4:12. LXX), is in its inner meaning a figure and image of all sinners. For the race of Adam, having broken the commandment and become guilty of sin, is shaken by restless thoughts, full of fear, cowardice and turmoil. Every soul not reborn in God is tossed hither and thither by the desires and multifarious pleasures of the enemy, and whirled about like com in a sieve. To show that those who act in accordance with the desires of the devil bear in themselves the image of Cain's iniquity, the Lord Himself said: 'You seek to carry out the desires of your father, the murderer. He was a murderer from the first and is not rooted in the truth" (cf. John 8:44).</p>
      <p> 53.  It is significant how deeply attracted men are by the spectacle of an earthly king and how eagerly they seek after it; and how everyone who lives in a city where the king has his residence longs to catch a glimpse simply of the extravagance and ostentation of his  entourage.  Only under the influence of spiritual things will they disregard all this and look down on it, wounded by another beauty and desiring a different kind of glory. If the sight of a mortal king is so important to worldly people, how much more desirable must the sight of the immortal king be to those into whom some drops of the Holy Spirit have fallen and whose hearts have been smitten by divine love? For this</p>

      <p> They will relinquish all amity with the world, so that they may keep that longing continually in their hearts, preferring nothing to it. But few indeed there are who add to a good beginning an equivalent end and who endure without stumbling until they reach it. Many are moved to repentance and many become partakers of heavenly grace and are wounded by divine love; but, unable to bear the ensuing tribulations and the wily and versatile assaults of the devil, they submit to the world and are submerged in its depths through the flabbmess and debility of their will, or are taken captive by some attachment to worldly things. Those who wish to pursue the way with assurance to the end will not permit any other longing or love to intermingle with their divine love.</p>
      <p> 54.  Just as the blessings promised by god are unutterably great, so their acquisition requires much hardship and toil undertaken with hope and faith. This is clear from Christ's words: 'if any man will come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me' (matt. 16:24); and: 'he who does not hate father and mother, brothers and sisters, wife and children, and even his own soul, cannot be a disciple of mine' (Luke 14:26). Most people are so lacking in intelligence as to want to attain the great and inconceivable blessing of the kingdom of god, and to inherit</p>
      <p> eternal life and reign for ever with Christ, while living according to their own desires - or rather, according to him who sows within them these clearly noxious vanities.</p>
      <p> 55.  Those who reach the goal without falling do so through hating themselves and all worldly desires, distractions, pleasures and preoccupations, for this is what 'denying oneself amounts to. Hence everyone expels himself from the kingdom by his own choice, through not embracing suffering and denying himself for the sake of the truth, but wanting to enjoy something of this world in addition to that divine longing, and not surrendering the whole inclination of his will to god. This may be understood from a single example. On examining himself a man realizes that what he is so eager to do is wicked. At first he feels doubt about it in his heart. Next, the measure and balance in his conscience make it clear inwardly whether the bias inclines to love for god or love for the world; and after that he proceeds to outward action. If for instance someone happens to have fallen out with his brother, then he examines himself, as we have said. At first he finds himself hesitant about whether to speak or not to speak, whether to return the insults hurled at him or to keep silent. At this point the man still remembers god's commandments, but he also thinks about his</p>

      <p> own reputation and has not fully chosen to deny himself. If a bias in favor of the world tips his heart's balance even slightly, an evil word will at once be on the tip of his tongue. When this happens, with the intellect stretched inwardly like a bow he attacks his neighbor with his tongue and even with his hands - indeed, the evil can proceed so far that wounds result, or even murder. Thus it is possible to compare the starting-point of the slight movement in his soul with the terrible consequences to which it led. In this way every sin and malpractice, whether adultery, theft, greed, self-esteem or anything else, occurs when the will of the soul is beguiled and coaxed to evil by worldly desires and pleasures of the flesh.</p>
      <p> 56.  Even good actions are frequently carried out for the sake of empty glory, and on this account they will be judged by God in the same way as theft, injustice and other major sins. 'God has scattered the bones of those who seek to please men", it is said (Ps. 53:5. LXX). The devil, being wily, versatile, tortuous and inventive, seeks to gain our allegiance and service even through our good actions.</p>
      <p> 57.  Whenever anyone loves something belonging to this world, it will burden his mind, dragging it down and not allowing it to rise up. In such people the weight, bias and balance of the will, that is, of the heart, are inclined to what is evil. It is in this way that torment and trial afflict the whole human race, whether they are Christians living in cities or on mountains, in monasteries, in the country or the desert. For if one is willingly enticed by what one loves it is clear that one has not yet dedicated all one's love to God. Whether one likes possessions, or gold, or serving</p>
      <p> one's stomach, or indulging in fleshly desires, or wordy wisdom designed to gain men's praise, or authority, or honors from men, or anger and wrath, or useless speeches, or merely day-dreaming and listening to idle words, or acting as a teacher for the sake of men's esteem-in each and every case to give oneself to a passion is manifestly to love it. One person surrenders himself to sluggishness and negligence, another delights in extravagant clothes, another in sleep, another in silly jokes: whatever the worldly thing, big or small, by which one is bound and held fast, it prevents one from raising oneself up. Clearly, we indulge ourselves in whatever passion we do not resist and fight against bravely: like some shackle it binds us and drags us down, degrading the mind so that it does not dedicate itself to God and worship Him alone. The soul that truly directs its desire towards the</p>

      <p> Lord focuses all its longing on Him, denying itself and not following the desires of its own intellect.</p>
      <p> 58.   Example makes it clear that man is destroyed by his own free choice: for out of love for some worldly thing he throws himself into fire, is drowned in the sea and gives himself into captivity. Let us suppose that someone's house or field has caught fire. The person who wanted to save himself fled without anything as soon as he noticed the fire, leaving everything in it and concerned only with his own life. But someone else thought he would take some of the goods with him, so he stayed behind to collect them; and as he was taking them the fire, which had already overwhelmed the house, caught him as well and burnt him. In this way, through his attachment to some transient thing, he was destroyed in the fire by his own free choice. Again, two men were shipwrecked. One of them, wanting to save himself, stripped off his clothes and threw himself into the water; and in this way he was able to save his life. The other, wanting to save his clothes as well, was drowned, destroying himself for the sake of a slight gain. Or again, let us suppose that news of an attack by an enemy was announced. One man, as soon as he heard the news, fled as fast as his feet would carry him, without a thought for his possessions. Another, either because he distrusted the news, or because he wanted to take with him some of his goods, waited until later, and when the enemy arrived he was caught. Thus, through his lack of alertness and his attachment to worldly things, he lost body and soul by his own free choice.</p>
      <p> 59.  Few are those who really acquire perfect love for God, looking upon all worldly pleasures and desires as nothing and patiently enduring the devil's trials. But one must not despair on this account, or give up hope. Even if many ships suffer shipwreck there are always those that come safely through to port. For this reason we need great faith, endurance, attentiveness, struggle, hunger and thirst for what is right, as well as great understanding and discrimination, together with clear-sightedness and lack of shame in making our requests. As we have said, most men want to attain the kingdom without toil and sweat; and although they praise the saints and desire their dignity</p>
      <p> and gifts, they are not willing to share with them in the same afflictions, hardships and sufferings. Everyone -prostitutes, tax-collectors and everyone else - wants this. For this reason, trials and temptations are set before us, so as to make it clear who in truth loves their Lord and deserves to attain the kingdom of heaven.</p>

      <p> III Patient Endurance and Discrimination</p>
      <p> 60.  In afflictions and sufferings, endurance and faith, are concealed the promised glory and the recovery of celestial blessings. Even the grain of com sown in the earth, or the graft on a tree, has to go through a kind of putrefaction and, so to say, humiliation before it clothes itself in its full glory and produces a rich crop. But for this putrefaction and, as it were, dishonoring, neither would attain its final glory and beauty. This is confirmed by the apostles when they say that to enter the kingdom of God we have to pass through many afflictions (cf. Acts 14:22). And the Lord Himself says: 'You will gain possession of your souls through your patient endurance' (Luke 21:19); and: "In the world you will experience affliction' (John 16:33).</p>
      <p> 61.  If through faith and effort we are enabled to become partakers of the Holy Spirit, then to a corresponding degree our bodies also will be glorified on the last day. For what is now treasured up within the soul will then be revealed outwardly in the body. Trees provide an illustration of this: once winter is past and the sun shines more brightly and fully and the winds blow benignly, they put forth buds from within and clothe themselves in leaves, flowers and fruits. Similarly, in springtime flowering plants shoot up from the breast of the earth so that the ground is covered with them, wearing them as though they we're a beautiful dress; as Christ says: 'Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these' (Matt. 6:29). All these are types and examples and images of the reward that the redeemed will receive at the resurrection; for to all devout souls - that is to say, to all true Christians - it is in the first month, which is April, that the power of the resurrection is revealed. In the words of Holy Scripture, 'This month .. . will be to you the first among the months of the year' (Exod. 12:2). This month will clothe the naked trees with the glory previously hidden within them. And so, too, will the bodies of the righteous be glorified through the ineffable light - the power of the Spirit-that is already present within them; and this will be to them clothing, food, drink, exultation, joy, peace and, crowning all, life eternal.</p>

      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> 62.   Through the glory of the Spirit that shone from his face in such a way that no one could look at it (cf. Exod. 54:30-31), Moses showed how in the resurrection of the righteous their bodies will be glorified with the glory that their souls already possess inwardly during this present life. For, as St Paul says, 'with unveiled face' - that is to say, inwardly - 'we reflect as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, and are transfigured into the same image from glory to glory' (2 Cor. 3:18). In this connection, too, it is said that Moses did not eat or drink for forty days and forty nights (cf. Exod. 34:28), something that human nature cannot accomplish unless nourished by spiritual food. Such is the food that the souls of the saints already during this present life receive from the Spirit.</p>
      <p> 63.   The glory that in the present life enriches the souls of the saints will cover and enfold their naked bodies at the resurrection and will carry them to heaven. Then with body and soul the saints will rest with God in the kingdom for ever. For God, when He created Adam, did not give him bodily wings, as He gave to the birds: His purpose was to confer the wings of the Spirit on him at the resurrection, so that he might be lifted up by them and carried wherever the Spirit desired. Such spiritual wings are given to the souls of the saints in this present life, so that their understanding may be raised by them to the spiritual realm. For the world of the Christians is a different world, with different garments, different food and a different form of enjoyment. We know that when Christ comes from heaven to resurrect all those who have died during the present age. He will divide them into two groups (cf. Matt. 25:31-33). Those who bear His sign, which is the seal of the Holy Spirit, He will set at His right hand, saying: "My sheep, when they hear My voice, recognize Me' (cf. John 10:14). Then He will envelop their bodies with the divine glory that, through their good works and the Spirit,</p>

      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> their souls have already received in the present life. Thus glorified by the divine light and caught up into the heavens to meet the Lord, they will always be with Him (cf. 1 Thess. 4:17-18).</p>
      <p> 64.  Those who intend to fulfill the Christian way of life to the best of their ability must first devote all their attention to the rational, discriminative and directing aspect of the soul. Per-fecting in this way their discrimination between good and evil, and defending the purity of their nature against the attacks of the passions that are contrary to nature, they go forward without stumbling, guided by the eye of discrimination and not embroiled with the impulses of evil. For the soul's will is able to preserve the body free from the vitiation of the senses, to keep the soul away from worldly distraction, and to guard the heart from scattering its thoughts into the world, completely walling</p>
      <p> them in and holding them back from base concerns and pleasures. Whenever the Lord sees someone acting in this manner, perfecting and guarding himself, disposed to serve Him with fear and trembling. He extends to him the assistance of His grace. But what will God do for the person who willingly gives himself up to the world and pursues its pleasures?</p>
      <p> 65. The five watchful virgins who bore in the vessels of their hearts the oil that was not inherent in their nature -for it is the grace of the Holy Spirit - were able to enter with the bridegroom into the bridal-chamber. But the other foolish and sinful virgins, who remained fixed in their own nature, did not practice watchfulness, nor did they think it important to receive this oil of joyfulness in their hearts, for they still walked according to the flesh. On the contrary, in their negligence, slothfulness and self-righteousness, they were as though asleep, and for this reason they were shut out from the bridal-chamber of the kingdom (cf. Matt. 25:1-13). It is clear that they were held back by some kind of bond and amity with the world, inasmuch as they could not offer all their love and longing to the celestial bridegroom. For souls aspiring to acquire the sanctifying power of the Spirit that is not intrinsic to human nature direct all their love towards Christ: they walk, pray, think and meditate in Christ, and they turn away from everything else. And if the soul's five senses -understanding, spiritual knowledge, discrimination, patient endurance and compassion - receive the grace and sanctification of the Spirit, they will in truth be wise virgins; but if they are left imprisoned in their own nature then they are indeed foolish virgin-children of the world and subject to the wrath of God.</p>

      <p> IV The Raising of the Intellect</p>
      <p> 66.   Evil is foreign to our nature; but, given admittance by us through the transgression of the first man, it has with time become as though natural to us. Yet through the celestial gift of the Spirit, that is also foreign to our nature, this nature can once more be completely purged of evil and we can be restored to our original purity. But unless this comes about as the result of great supplication, faith and attentiveness, and by our turning away from the things of the world; and unless our nature, denied as it is by evil, is sanctified by the love that is the Lord, and we continue unfailingly to apply ourselves to His divine commandments, we cannot attain the kingdom of Heaven.</p>
